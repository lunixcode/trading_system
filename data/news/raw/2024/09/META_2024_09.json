        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\n\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Latest reports indicate that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has chosen Arista Networks to provide the networking for a massive AI model training cluster that will be powered by over 100,000 GPUs. Meta will use NVIDIA H100 GPUs for the cluster that features $2 billion worth of chips. It will train the Llama 4 large language model. Investment advisory Evercore ISI claims the deal would represent a $250 million revenue opportunity for Arista Networks. At the annual Meta Connect event held this month, Meta unveiled new versions of Llama, augmented reality Orion glasses, and mixed-reality product Quest 3s.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Zuckerberg's Meta Gamble Pays Off; Now Fourth-Richest Person Globally",
        "content": "Zuckerberg's Meta Gamble Pays Off; Now Fourth-Richest Person Globally\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the founder behind Meta (previously Facebook), leaped into the ranks of the world's fourth-richest person with a net worth of $201 billion. His spectacular rise comes after the strategic shift of Meta into metaverse hardware and artificial intelligence from October 2021.\n\nMeta's stock is making a roaring comeback, trading at around $567 per share, a massive six-fold hike from its November 2022 price of about $88. It has made this dramatic turn in fortune after investors had been initially skeptical of the ambitious foray into developing augmented reality and AI that the company embarked on.\n\nThe financial rise by Zuckerberg now places him in the company of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, according to Bloomberg's latest wealth ranking. Half of the world's top 10 most valuable companies, including tech giants Apple, Google, Nvidia, and Microsoft, are now developing their own metaverse hardware.\n\nDuring a recent Meta Connect event in California, Zuckerberg unveiled two of the company's latest creations: Orion augmented reality glasses and the more affordable Quest 3S VR headset. These Orion glasses boast advanced projectors that can beam a virtual heads-up display onto the real world, a new direction that Meta is taking in its commitment to immersive technology.\n\nDespite high-flying stocks, the company imposed a 20% budget cut on its metaverse division, Reality Labs, and asked for a 20% reduction in departmental expenses by 2026. In fact, Reality Labs was among the most expensive Meta projects, having lost some $60 billion since 2019 and continuing to remain in loss during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nZuckerberg has made clear that Meta intends to scale its AI business by narrowing the focus of the company and putting more capital investment into AI research. \"We've released the first frontier-level open-source AI model, and we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses,\" Zuckerberg said on the recent earnings call.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Newsom vetoes US's first bill aimed at regulating large-scale artificial intelligence",
        "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a first-of-its-kind state bill that would potentially enact the most impactful artificial intelligence regulation in the country.\n\nThe measure, known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, would require safety measures from companies that spend more than $100 million to train AI models. It aims to prevent potential harms by AI such as mass casualty events, and includes implementing a \"kill switch\" to completely shut down a rogue model.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of AI's biggest players including: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (GOOG), and Meta (META). However, in his veto message on Sunday afternoon Newsom said SB 1047 is \"well-intentioned,\" but it \"does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.”\n\nAlong with the veto, Newsom announced he's working with leading experts — including \"the godmother of AI\" Fei-Fei Li — to set guardrails around the deployment of GenAI. He also ordered state agencies to expand their assessment of the risks associated with the technology.\n\nRegulating the technology has been a flashpoint in Silicon Valley and beyond. OpenAI, Google and Meta publicly opposed the bill. Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN), cautiously supported it after suggesting amendments to its original version.\n\nDespite the pushback from big tech, more than 100 current and former employees from Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic called on Newsom to sign the legislation earlier this month, expressing concerns that “the most powerful AI models may soon pose severe risks.”\n\nMore than 125 Hollywood actors, directors and entertainment leaders had also urged Newsom to sign the bill, writing in a letter: \"we fully believe in the dazzling potential of AI to be used for good. But we must also be realistic about the risks.\"\n\nSB 1047 had to thread the needle between encouraging innovation in the rapidly changing industry while ensuring the tech is used responsibly.\n\nNewsom discussed his concerns over SB 1047 with Salesforce (CRM) CEO, Marc Benioff, at the annual Dreamforce conference earlier this month. “The impact of signing wrong bills over the course of a few years could have a profound impact,\" Newsom said referring to the state's competitiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is a space where we dominate and I want to maintain our dominance. I want to maintain our innovation. I want to maintain our ecosystem. I want to continue to lead. At the same time, you feel a deep sense of responsibility to address some of those more extreme concerns that I think many of us have, even the biggest and strongest promoters of this technology have.\"\n\nSupporters of the legislation include billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, who owns large AI model company xAI, along with the so-called \"Godfathers of AI\": Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton. California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nThe main author of the bill, California state Senator Scott Wiener, has said it's a reasonable framework for an under-regulated technology. Wiener has been vocal about the need for a strong federal law that would set nationwide guardrails for all developers.\n\nHowever, Wiener isn't hopeful that a national AI safety bill will be a reality anytime soon, calling congress \"completely paralyzed when it comes to technology policy\" at a press conference last month.\n\n\"Let me be clear - I agree with the author - we cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public,\" Newsom wrote, adding \"I do not agree, however, that to keep the public safe, we must settle for a solution that is not informed by an empirical trajectory analysis of Al systems and capabilities. Ultimately, any framework for effectively regulating Al needs to keep pace with the technology itself.\"\n\nThe bill was set to reshape the future of AI and numerous tech executives have spoken out.\n\n\"There are risks associated with AI, less to do with the models themselves and more to do with what the models are allowed to do in the real world if left completely unsupervised,\" Affirm (AFRM) CEO, Max Levchin, told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference.\n\n\"So I'm not diminishing or dismissing the need for controls, and model governance and oversight and thoughtful rule making. I would just not want to 'shut it all down' to quote another AI doomerist.\"\n\nAlthough the bill flew past the state assembly 48-16 (7 democrats voted no) and Senate 30-9 (one democrat voted no) in August, it's faced some political opposition from California Democrats.\n\nCritics of SB 1047 include eight California house members — Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna G. Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan, Lou Correa — and longtime Newsom ally former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIn the last month, Newsom has signed 17 AI-related bills aimed at combating deepfake election content, protecting actors and entertainers over their digital likeness, regulating sexually explicit content created by AI among other measures.\n\nThe new set of laws will require developers and social media companies to prevent irresponsible use of its platform using deceptive content.\n\nWhile those legislation address the immediate dangers of AI, SB 1047 looks ahead at some of the most extreme risks posed by advanced models.\n\nWhile speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Joe Biden called on world leaders to establish AI standards that protect human life.\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we need to do to manage this new technology,\" President Biden said. \"In the years ahead, there may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with AI.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI feel like I have gotten dumber each day of September.\n\nAnd honestly, I have no one to blame but the person looking back in the mirror.\n\nI have mostly spent the month on the West Coast ingesting the latest advances in artificial intelligence. First at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference, then Salesforce's (CRM) annual Dreamforce extravaganza, and currently with AI chats on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (now stationed at the Nasdaq). I'll toss in a Netflix event I went to Thursday night where Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates talked for an hour, mostly on AI and the future of the world.\n\nTechnically, I guess all of these AI discussions are making me a more informed journalist, leader, and human being.\n\nBut sometimes listening to what people deep in the weeds are doing in AI sound like a completely different language. Think Martians speaking on Pluto. And the lingo and development of AI tools and products are moving at a speed multiples faster compared to my last West Coast venture in September 2023.\n\nHard to keep up and not think you have an IQ of 75!\n\nIt already feels like I am way behind the curve on understanding the next wave of AI — and that's alarming because 1) there's potential for at least five more waves to hit civilization; 2) the average person on the street unlikely realizes how their very way of life is about to be affected by an AI-powered agent or some other piece of technology. Bill Gates dives into the future of the world at a Netflix event on Thursday alongside journalist Kara Swisher. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWe saw that firsthand with the new AI functionality Meta (META) and OpenAI showed off this week for their various products. This was a series of wow moments.\n\nBill Gates proceeded to tell a packed theater that AI will soon become \"superior\" at \"very profound\" tasks. Reassuring!\n\nI also experienced it up close and personal with a real nice German fella named Richard Socher on Opening Bid (video above).\n\nNever heard of the 41-year-old Socher? You should be following his work at search engine You.com, a company he founded. He was the first chief scientist at Salesforce (CEO Marc Benioff was an early backer of You.gov), and he eats, sleeps, and breathes AI.\n\nThe company is now valued at close to $1 billion after an investment led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHere are a couple of quotes from Socher that left an impression:\n\n\"I think over the next few years and maybe decades, almost every company will be hit with some kind of innovator's dilemma in that the way they used to make revenue is going to change because a lot of their processes are going to get automated with AI. And that just changes the nature of the work that you're doing. You need to stop thinking about almost any repetitive process. Every time you feel like, oh, I've done this before, I'm just going through these steps, you should be giving those as a prompt to an agent and then get an accurate AI agent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think actually in the next few years, we're probably going to see more and more AI agents surfing the web for you than we have people surfing the web, which will change the web as we know it too, and how it often monetizes. But it basically means that a lot of people will get access to their own personal assistant in the way only really wealthy people have right now.\"\n\nYou may be wondering what this all means to you, the investor.\n\nHere are a few notes from me on that front before you go:\n\n2025 is going to be one hell of a year for Nvidia and AMD (AMD). The demand for AI chips only seems to be strengthening. What that means for struggling Intel (INTC), well... This coming earnings season, listen for executives at companies you invest in outline cost-cutting moves by using AI. If you hear crickets, it could be a signal the company doesn't have a great AI strategy in place and risks getting left behind. Today is the day to buy three books on AI to understand the lingo and possibilities — and then think critically on how the technology could be applied to investments you are eying.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

Or listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIn the below Opening Bid episode, early You.com backer and Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff shares his views on how AI will shape the business world.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Nine months into the year, the stock market is red-hot. The S&P 500, NasdaqComposite, and DowJonesIndustrialIndex are all at or near all-time highs.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the reasons why is the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nLet's examine two AI stocks that have already made a few fortunes and have the potential to make many more in the years to come. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nWhen it comes to AI, size and scale matter -- and no social media company has a greater scale than MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META).\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter, Meta had nearly 3.3 billion daily active users (DAUs). That's a huge advantage for the company in many ways, but consider this: Meta is in a position to introduce its AI-powered features to roughly 40% of the world's population.\n\nThat may not guarantee success, but it's a great start.\n\nAs for the tools themselves, the company has developed several, under the banner of Meta AI, powered by its Llama 3.1 model:\n\nImage generation Problem solving Search capabilities Research Smart glasses\n\nCrucially, the technology is designed to integrate with Meta's family of apps. For example, users could ask Meta AI to generate a picture of them standing in front of the Eiffel Tower, which they could then post to Instagram or Facebook. Similarly, a user might ask Meta AI to suggest some recipe ideas for an upcoming potluck dinner -- then post the ideas for those who are looking for inspiration.\n\nWhether Meta AI will take off remains unknown. But in any event, Meta remains a stock that could continue making millionaires for many years to come. The company's massive user base is generating tremendous amounts of ad revenue and profits -- much of which it is returning to shareholders via stock buybacks and its recently instituted dividend. That makes Meta a stock that investors shouldn't ignore.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nOftentimes, it can be best to avoid overthinking in investing. That's why I must suggest Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) as an AI stock that could make you a millionaire.\n\nThe company's business model revolves around helping organizations make sense of vast volumes of data and use them to reach conclusions that they can act upon. That might seem like a simplistic business model -- but one look at Palantir's financials will demonstrate why it's a winning formula.\n\nIn the second quarter, Palantir's total revenue grew by 27% year over year while its U.S. commercial revenue increased by an even faster 55%. And while commercial clients are rushing to adopt Palantir's platform to increase their efficiency, the company is still landing big contracts from its traditional source of strength: governments' defense branches and intelligence agencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sept. 20, the company announced it had been awarded a five-year, $100 million contract to extend the use of its Maven smart system to the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, and Marine Corps.\n\nIt's another sign that while the company is more aggressively pursuing private-sector clients, government contracts remain an important piece of the puzzle. Indeed, government-derived revenues still account for more than half of its top line.\n\nAnalysts expect the company's sales to increase a further 21% next year to about $3.3 billion. Granted, the AI field is volatile, and Palantir stock isn't an appropriate pick for every investor or portfolio. However, those looking for an AI stock with massive upside potential need look no further than Palantir.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nChris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is “ a lot of momentum” behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.\n\n“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”\n\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.\n\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\n“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.\n\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Trending AI Stock to Watch for the Rest of 2024?\n\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nGene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that while he is bullish on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s ability to drive engagement on its platform using AI, the “substance” of the initial details at its Connect event was a “little thin.”\n\n“Meta is making it clear they believe in a future where smart glasses – they refer to them as AI glasses – are going to be hundreds of millions of units. Today if you look at Quest it’s probably five million units, probably one percent of sales,” Munster said.\n\nAsked whether the stock’s 60%+ gain so far this year is justified, Munster said yes, adding that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s earnings have posted strong growth and we haven’t even “begun” to see the benefit of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Is Still a Long-Term Winner, No Matter the Noise",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) prodigy Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s third-highest-valued stock, experienced a material decline in market capitalization following its Q2 earnings in late August. However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold.  My thesis remains unchanged — I’m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential.\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term AI-Driven Growth Trajectory Remains Intact\n\nIt is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia’s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses.\n\nThere’s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That’s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver.\n\nNVDA Remains a One-Stop AI Powerhouse with Margin Growth\n\nAnother reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang‘s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand.\n\nThis strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA’s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.\n\nFor context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today’s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.\n\nDemand for NVDA’s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.\n\nA Discussion of Nvidia’s Impressive Quarterly Earnings\n\nNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.\n\nThe company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts’ projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company’s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA’s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.\n\nNvidia’s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with revenues expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.\n\nNVDA’s Insider Selling Concerns are Over\n\nInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it’s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.\n\nNotably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.\n\nNVDA Valuation Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Growth Prowess\n\nInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock’s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company’s and slowing growth.\n\nOn the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA’s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA’s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.\n\nGiven NVDA’s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia’s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nWith 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44 implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.\n\nIn the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.\n\nRead full Disclosure\n\nView comments",

Nvidia’s 156% year-to-date gain and 2,700% gain over the past five years may lead many to suspect there’s limited upside from here, but artificial intelligence is still in its early innings. Understanding the AI opportunity and Nvidia’s unique position in the industry leads me to be bullish on the stock.\n\nDiving into the AI Boom\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence has already captivated investors for multiple years, the boom is still going strong, and that leads to my optimism for NVDA stock. Corporations are making significant investments in artificial intelligence, and that demand has resulted in a projected 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034.\n\nArtificial intelligence helps businesses enhance their products and services. For example, CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been investing in Charlotte AI and other AI features to fortify its cybersecurity software. Adobe (ADBE) has also invested in artificial intelligence to help individuals and businesses create better images and videos.\n\nNvidia supplies the AI chips that power these tools. While other semiconductor firms also offer AI chips, Nvidia continues to innovate its chip offerings to stay ahead of the competition. The company is working on its new Blackwell chip, which is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nThe High Cost of AI Infrastructure\n\nRight now, artificial intelligence looks similar to the early days of the internet, in my view. The groundbreaking technology has substantial barriers to entry. Nvidia wins much of the new business, contributing to my bullish outlook for NVDA stock.\n\nBig tech companies within the Magnificent Seven have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology. Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison recently said that the company is behind on its AI infrastructure goals. Oracle will likely turn to Nvidia to close that gap, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales potentially heading Nvidia’s way. Elon Musk’s companies are also in the fray. Tesla and xAI are set to spend a combined $20 billion on AI projects in 2024 alone.\n\nCorporations aren’t flinching and seem resolved to making additional investments in 2025 and beyond. AI infrastructure is expensive to set up, maintain, and scale. This dynamic benefits Nvidia tremendously as it has established a near monopoly in the industry. According to the IDC, organizations are projected to nearly triple their AI investments by the end of 2028. This research suggests a 30% compounded annual growth rate during that stretch.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s Many Partnerships\n\nNvidia is knocking elbows with the ‘who’s who’ of big tech and publicly traded corporations. It’s another reason to feel bullish about the company’s prospects, and Nvidia’s partners have deep wallets. The AI chipmaker has partnerships with Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other titans in the industry.\n\nMany of these same tech companies have been reporting record profits. Nvidia’s biggest customers are relatively well-insulated and can continue to pour money into artificial intelligence even during an economic slowdown. The technology’s mainstream appeal is relatively new, and investments are still ramping up. Nvidia’s partnerships make it more likely that the company will continue outgrowing the broader market regardless of whether the economy stalls.\n\nEven better, key partnerships are likely to expand with age. As Nvidia continues to deliver top-class AI chips to its customers, those clients are more likely to stick with Nvidia and make further large investments. Nvidia has been working with Amazon for more than a decade, while Alphabet recently expanded its partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s Valuation Isn’t Prohibitive\n\nNvidia’s valuation is still reasonably low in considering its revenue and earnings growth rates. While a 58x trailing P/E ratio seems high, especially when compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia has been more than doubling its net income on year-over-year comparisons.\n\nOn a forward basis, Nvidia stock is priced at a 43.5x P/E ratio, making the valuation look more affordable. Furthermore, the company reported 152% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY25. High revenue growth paves the way for high net income growth. If Nvidia continues to report a few more quarters of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, the forward P/E ratio should continue to drop.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia stock is currently rated as a consensus Strong Buy among 42 Wall Street analysts. The average NVDA price target of $152.44 implies about 23% potential upside. The most optimistic price target of $200 reflects 62% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts carry 39 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings on NVDA stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia is an undisputed leader within the artificial intelligence boom. It has established a leading position in supplying the demand for AI capabilities. Nvidia has some of the best customers on the planet, and these corporations are surely to continue investing in AI even during an economic downturn.\n\nRevenue and net income growth remain superb and, when looking at forward multiples, NVDA stock doesn’t look unreasonably valued. Many Wall Street analysts feel the same way, hence the consensus Strong Buy rating. Alongside them, I continue to be bullish NVDA.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "My Favorite \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Nvidia's Not One)",
        "content": "\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks refers to a phrase coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the cohort leading the market. They are:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nTesla lagged behind the others this year due to a decreased demand for electric vehicles, but the other six have done quite well. However, a few of them have reached points where they are no longer attractive buys, leaving only a few that I'd buy right now.\n\nThere are four stocks I'm not interested in right now\n\nIf you don't have a generative artificial intelligence (AI) product, you don't belong in this group. Although Tesla isn't actively engaged in generative AI, its AI research is focused on full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which is another worthy endeavor, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nHowever, Apple was considerably late to the AI party and couldn't even get its Apple Intelligence product ready to go for the iPhone 16 launch. Couple that with the fact that Apple is extremely expensive (30 times forward earnings) with flattening revenue growth, and it quickly falls off the list of good buys.\n\nAs mentioned, the EV market is going through a downward demand wave, so I'm not interested in Tesla.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft are quite pricey, although they may still be good investments in their own right. However, they just don't have the value of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is on the rise\n\nAmazon makes the list of stocks to buy because of its resurging cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although Amazon is expensive in its own right, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 times, it has the potential to drastically decrease that price tag thanks to AWS.\n\nDespite accounting for 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, AWS accounted for 64% of its operating profit. This means that if AWS grows at a faster pace than the rest of Amazon's business, Amazon's profits will rise at a faster pace than revenue growth. Couple that with several profit-boosting initiatives, and Amazon's case to grow profits rapidly takes form.\n\nAs a result, I'm not concerned with Amazon's price tag, and it presents itself as a very attractive buy.\n\nAlphabet is much cheaper than the market\n\nAlphabet's investment case is fairly simple: It's cheap. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system has a healthy but growing ad business, which helps fund its other endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless its AI tools really take off, Alphabet's growth isn't going to be spectacular, but it will likely be consistently in the low double digits, which is enough to provide market-beating growth. Couple that with an improving operating margin and hefty stock buybacks, and you get a stock that can consistently grow earnings in the 20% range (it grew them by over 30% in Q2).\n\nDespite this, Alphabet's stock trades for 18.6 times forward earnings, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23 times forward earnings. Alphabet has the formula to steadily outperform the S&P 500, yet trades at a discount. This is a huge mismatch, and it makes the stock a screaming buy right now.\n\nMeta is rapidly growing profits and revenue\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms sneakily posted the second-highest year-over-year revenue growth of the group over the past year (behind Nvidia's incredible growth).\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta's business is driven by ads on its social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. This allows Meta to fund its AI endeavors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.\n\nBasically, Meta is doing the same thing as Alphabet -- but at a faster pace. GOOGL Normalized Basic EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAs a result, you'll pay a slightly higher premium for Meta's stock at 23.6 times forward earnings. But I think this is a worthy premium to pay, as Meta is currently executing at a high level.\n\nEven though the Magnificent Seven have had a strong 2024, there are still reasons to buy some of the group, and I suspect that their performance will continue to be strong moving forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $760,130!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of  AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company recently released the latest large language model, Llama 3.2, also announcing mini versions of the LLM that allow them to fit on edge and mobile devices. The products were revealed during the Meta Connect 2024 event. First looks reveal that the Llama 3.2 1B and 3B models are text-only and support a context length of 128k tokens. They can perform on-device use cases such as summarizations, following instructions and rewriting tasks locally. The models are enabled for Qualcomm and MediaTek hardware and optimized for Arm processors.\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey recently raised the price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock to $645 from $580 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. In an investor note, the analyst noted that as Reels ad load and usage continued to expand, Meta's discovery engine and content recommendation models, powered in part by its investments in generative artificial intelligence, were a competitive advantage and represented a clear path of large language models return on investment.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Calls Out Tech Firms: No Technical Skills In Leadership? You're \"Not A Technology Company\"",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg Calls Out Tech Firms: No Technical Skills In Leadership? You're \"Not A Technology Company\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg has a blunt take on what makes a tech company legit. It's all about who's in charge. If they don't have technical skills? Well, then you might not be a real tech company at all.\n\nZuck got real on a recent “Acquired” podcast episode and didn't mince words. When he first hit Silicon Valley, he was floored by how many so-called tech companies had leaders who couldn't code to save their lives. “The CEO wasn't technical, the board of directors had no one technical on it, they had like one dude on the management team who was the head of engineering who was technical and everyone else wasn't,” he said. “If that's your team, then you're not a technology company.”\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nHe's not just throwing shade. Zuck's been there and done that. He built Facebook from scratch in his Harvard dorm room at 19. So, yeah, he knows what he's talking about.\n\nAt Meta, Zuck's made sure it's different. He's picky about who's running the show. “I think one of the things that I've always been pretty careful about is I actually want a lot of the people on our management team. It's split. It's mostly people running these big product groups who come up through different technical pathways at the company and I think there's a balance,” he said. He's also not naive. He understands that not everyone needs to be an engineer. “You don't want everyone to be an engineer because there are other things that matter too,” he added. “But if you don't have enough of your kind of share of the company as engineers, then you're not a technology company.”\n\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nJust look at Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Meta's CTO, the guy who invented Facebook's News Feed. Now, he's leading Meta's charge into the metaverse. Or Chris Cox, who joined Meta in 2005 as a software engineer. He's one of the brains behind the News Feed too. These are the kinds of people Zuck believes should be running the show.\n\nIt's not just about filling seats. It's about how these tech-savvy leaders shape the company's culture and decision-making. Zuck's point? “I think that also is important to the board in terms of how you weigh decisions and culturally things inside the company matter a lot.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nBut Zuck's not saying it's all about coding. He knows other skills matter. He's just saying that if you want to be a tech company, you better have some serious technical talent at the top.\n\nIn the same chat, Zuck got personal. He owned up to what he calls his “20-year mistake” of taking heat for stuff Meta didn't even cause. He also threw down the gauntlet, saying Apple will be Meta's biggest rival in the next decade.\n\nMeta hasn't chimed in on the podcast yet, but one thing's clear: Zuck's laid down the law on what it takes to be a real tech company. And if your leadership is light on technical skills, it's time to rethink your playbook.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

        "content": "Microsoft, Google, Meta Pave Path to AI Expansion, Nvidia and Broadcom Set to Reap Benefits\n\nThe quarterly performance of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) adequately reflects that the artificial intelligence wave is in no mood to slow down in the near term.\n\nHyperscalers, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) remain aggressively invested in their artificial intelligence ambitions. The U.S. and China’s key rate cuts also added an additional tailwind for the capital-intensive industry.\n\nMicrosoft committed 14.7 billion Reais ($2.70 billion) over three years to Brazil’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to a Reuters report.\n\nAlso Read: Micron’s AI-Driven HBM Demand and Data Center Growth to Fuel Stock Upside, Analysts Say\n\nThe company’s ConectAI program will train 5 million people with AI skills over the next three years. Microsoft already has two Azure regions: one in São Paulo state, which it launched in 2014, and another in Rio de Janeiro, which it launched in 2020.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft earmarked $1.3 billion over the next three years to drive Mexico’s AI infrastructure and initiatives, including training 5 million people. Microsoft also collaborated with BlackRock, Inc (NYSE:BLK) and other partners, forging a fresh $30 billion investment fund to tap the AI wave.\n\nGoogle is eyeing a $3.3 billion investment in South Carolina to build two new data centers. The search engine giant’s plans included two new data center campuses in Dorchester County and expanding its existing data center campus in Berkeley County, Reuters cites the South Carolina governor’s office as saying.\n\nAlphabet committed $2 billion to the Dorchester County facilities, potentially creating 200 new operational jobs. According to Reuters, the company also earmarked $1.3 billion for Berkeley County.\n\nAnother positive update for the industry is the report indicating struggling chipmaker Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and the U.S. government are trying to finalize the $8.5 billion in direct funding for the chipmaker before the end of the year.\n\nTherefore, Intel’s exploration of stake sales to companies like Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) could also disrupt its chances of bagging the subsidy over antitrust grounds. Intel had already faced Senator scrutiny over its cost-cutting measures as the subsidy aims to create additional U.S. jobs.\n\nSemiconductor ETFs VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) gained 5%-6% in the last 5 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock is up 1.21% to $24.21 premarket at last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMeta Analysts Highlight AI, VR Advances, See Growth Pushing It Toward Apple-Like Valuation\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nAdvances in AI could trigger unwelcome outcomes for investors in the future.\n\nAs AI advances speed up markets and also create more complex trading models, a lot of stocks may become overcrowded in the search for alpha — and at risk for swift downdrafts if information changes, warns Tradeweb Markets (TW) CEO Billy Hult.\n\n\"It's something [we have] to think through,\" Hult told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nCrowded trades occur when similar investment strategies — usually fueled by complex trading models —send investors all into the same stocks. Shares of the overcrowded stocks tend to rise as the bulls rush in with reckless abandon, and little attention is paid to a company's valuation.\n\nLiquidity shortages, spikes in volatility, and short squeezes are some risks that come with crowded trades.\n\nThe other risk is that the stocks could get hammered significantly if information changes, sending everyone headed for the exit all at once.\n\nThe latest example: the swift sell-off in markets in early August.\n\nBank of America strategists said in a report at the time that “crowding risk mattered,” and it saw “the least crowded stocks outperforming the most crowded by eight percentage points.”\n\nThe Magnificent 7 tech stocks rose again in popularity this summer, as AI chips powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) enjoyed a brief stay as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nPros like Hult argue this type of crowding into top-performing stocks will only worsen as AI makes markets more sophisticated.\n\nProponents of AI envision, however, a world where traders are better informed through deeper insight gathered from a variety of sources.\n\n“I think we’re going to continue to see data driven execution in fixed income trading. And we're going to continue to see machine learning get applied to, sort of how the search for liquidity occurs in fixed income,” said Hult. “The next level of technology is going to be more sophisticated.”\n\nHult is a longtime evangelist of integrating finance, investment vehicles, and revolutionary technology. As a builder of electronic marketplaces, Tradeweb has worked with firms that seek to unite investors and machines. But it also stays true to the need for softer people skills.\n\n“[Tradeweb] has lived and breathed in the ethos of the market for a long time,” Hult said. “We really value the personal relationship side of the business.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Meta was punished Friday with a fine worth more than $100 million from the social media giant's European Union privacy regulator over a security lapse involving passwords for Facebook users.\n\nThe Irish Data Protection Commission said it slapped the U.S. tech company with the 91 million euro ($101.6 million) penalty following an investigation.\n\nThe watchdog started investigating in 2019 after it was notified by Meta that some passwords had been inadvertently stored internally in plain text, which means they weren't encrypted and it was possible for employees to search for them.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said it's “widely accepted” that user passwords should not be stored in plain text, \"considering the risks of abuse.”\n\nMeta said a security review found that a “subset” of Facebook users' passwords were “temporarily logged in a readable format.”\n\n“We took immediate action to fix this error, and there is no evidence that these passwords were abused or accessed improperly,” the company said in a statement. \"We proactively flagged this issue to our lead regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and have engaged constructively with them throughout this inquiry.”\n\nIt's the latest in a series of hefty fines for Meta and its social media platforms from the Dublin-based watchdog, which is the company's lead regulator under the 27-nation EU's stringent data privacy rulebook. They include a 405 million euro fine for Instagram over mishandling teen data, a 5.5 million euro penalty involving WhatsApp and a 1.2 billion euro fine for Meta over transatlantic data transfers.\n\nView comments",

The event also featured a glimpse of Orion, a fully functioning prototype of AR smart glasses that blend AR and AI together on one device. The firm thinks Meta is making encouraging progress along its AI product roadmap with Meta AI on track to become the most used AI assistant globally by the end of this year. Meta’s Reality Labs investments are an area of investor debate, with the unit generating -$16.7B of operating losses over the past twelve months. That said, Wedbush thinks Reality Labs investments are becoming more synergistic with the core business as AI becomes a more central component of existing and upcoming hardware products. New products within the Quest 3 family and upcoming AR hardware like Orion present significant optionality for Meta as the company looks to build next generation computing platforms at scale, the firm adds.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\n\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\n\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\n\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\n\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\n\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\n\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is an American multinational company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. It formerly operated as Facebook, Inc. until its rebranding in 2021. It is one of the largest technology companies in the world and owns popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta’s apps every day, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe company posted robust financial results during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, with total revenue reaching $39.1 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase. Net income for the quarter was $13.5 billion, with an earnings per share of $5.16, comfortably beating analysts’ estimates of $4.72. Revenue from Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Family of Apps totaled $38.7 billion in Q2, up 22% from last year. Most of this was ad revenue, with the online commercial vertical being the largest contributor, followed by gaming.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s ability to generate solid ad revenue despite global economic challenges has been the catalyst behind the company’s growth and has boosted investor confidence. Its share price has grown 58% year-to-date, with analysts predicting a further 1-2% increase in the coming months. There’s a consensus among Street experts on the stock’s Strong Buy rating.\n\nMoreover, the company has spent billions in recent years on artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of successful products like Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, whose demand has outpaced the company’s expectations. These investments in advanced technology have led to a general bullish sentiment about the stock’s long-term trajectory. According to Insider Monkey’s database as of Q2 2024, 219 hedge funds have a stake in the company, making it one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now.\n\nHaving said that, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) looks set for long-term growth, some challenges on the horizon could impact the stock in the short term. One of them is the slowdown in revenue the company has anticipated for Q3 2024 compared to last year when much of the revenue was driven by a surge of China-based advertisers on its social media apps and the growth experienced by Reels impressions. That is unlikely to happen this year. Furthermore, the company plans on spending around $40 billion on capital expenditure this year, which could impact its short-term financials, and subsequently, its share price.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don’t waste time with underperformers—they target the market's elite.\n\nThe Stock Market Rally\n\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%–5.00% from 5.25%–5.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024—the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\n“Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we’re on our way back to 2%. So I don’t think you’re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.”\n\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed’s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\n\nWhat the Top Dogs of Wall Street are Saying About the Market\n\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 32\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a leading tech company known for its popular products like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In addition to social media, it is a leader in AR/VR technology.\n\nOn September 23, Roth Capital expressed a positive outlook on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), citing strong growth in the company's cost per thousand impressions (CPMs). Data from advertising agencies shows Meta’s CPM growth accelerating from 27% year-over-year in Q1 to 36% YoY in Q2, with Q3-to-date figures reflecting a 40% YoY increase. This consistent rise in CPMs, climbing from $5.62 in Q1 to $6.94 in Q3, signals robust demand for advertising on the company's platforms.\n\nAdditionally, BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating, expecting Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to launch new AI chat options and features for WhatsApp and Messenger. The firm also anticipates updates on Llama, Meta’s open-source language model, at an upcoming developer event. Additionally, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ended the second quarter with a strong cash position, holding $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company's free cash flow for the quarter reached $10.9 billion, easily covering the $1.3 billion in dividends distributed.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey, 32 billionaires held stakes in Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as of the most recent quarter.\n\nRowan Street Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text).\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\n\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\n\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company is gearing up to host the Meta Connect event, an annual developer event where it unveils new AI products.

Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg is also expected to unveil new artificial intelligence features for WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, as well as new smart glasses and mixed reality goggles at the event.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss.

        "content": "Meta Platforms META expanded its portfolio at Connect on Wednesday with the launch of a cheaper Quest 3S headset, Orion Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, new AI features for Ray-Ban Meta glasses and new multimodal features for Meta AI.\r\n\r\nQuest 3S offers the same mixed reality experience and fast performance as Meta Quest 3 at a lower price of $299.99. It also dropped the price of the Quest 3 512 GB version. The developments are expected to improve META’s competitive prowess against Apple’s AAPL AR device - Vision Pro.\r\n\r\nThe new Orion AR glass has the largest field of view when compared with its small form factor. Supported by Meta AI smart assistant, the glass understands what a user is looking at in the physical world and can help the user with visuals. Although Orion, at its current avatar, will not be available to the public, Meta Platforms plans to use it extensively for development purposes.\n\nRay-Ban Meta AR Glasses Gets New AI Features\n\nThe company is adding new AI features to Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Meta AI will make it easier to make conversations. It is also getting video capability. The AR glasses can now remember things like parking spots, while users can set reminders through voice commands for important tasks.\r\n\r\nRay-Ban Meta glasses will be able to translate speech from different languages, including Spanish, French and Italian to English soon through its open-ear speakers. \r\n\r\nExpanding integrations with Spotify SPOT and Amazon Music, as well as new partnerships with Audible and iHeart, are expected to offer an enhanced experience to Ray-Ban Meta AR glass users.\n\nMeta AI Gets Voice Capability, Can Edit Photos\n\nMeta AI, currently used by more than 400 million on a monthly basis, is getting voice capability. Users can talk to Meta AI on Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram DM and it will respond back at different voices. \r\n\r\nUsers can choose from the AI voices of Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan Michael Key and Kristen Bell to give voice to their own Meta AI assistant.\r\n\r\nUsers can now share photos in chats with Meta AI, which now has the ability to answer questions about it. Meta AI can now edit photos users share in a chat.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is expanding Meta AI’s Imagine features on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.\n\nMETA’s Data Trove Makes the Stock an AI Behemoth\n\nAI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.2 billion daily users. Meta Platforms has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook.\r\n\r\nIts staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 10% year over year in second-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Alphabet GOOGL.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults (18-29-year-olds), a demography that used to prefer Alphabet’s YouTube and Snapchat. \r\n\r\nMETA is incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer oriented. It is expanding business AIs that can talk to their customers, offer support and facilitate commerce to several businesses that use click-to-message ads on WhatsApp and Messenger in English. \r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ generative AI ad tools are gaining strong adoption. More than a million advertisers used the tools and 15 million ads were created with them in the last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA Rises 61% YTD: What Should Investors Do?\n\nMeta Platforms’ shares have returned 60.6% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 23.4% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s appreciation of 21.1%.\n\nMETA Outperforms Sector YTD Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms is aggressively spending on developing AI infrastructure and now expects to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on these efforts in 2024. This should not be a concern for investors, given its strong cash balance of $58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. It is already working on Llama 4. \r\n\r\nHowever, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern. Increasing regulatory headwinds have been a constant bother for META investors.\n\nMETA’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward Movement\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $21.36 per share, up 0.3% over the past 30 days, indicating a 43.64% year-over-year increase.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "content": "Facebook-parent Meta Platforms hosted its annual Connect developer conference yesterday, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the tech giant’s plans for the metaverse in the artificial intelligence era.\n\nThe Facebook founder began his keynote speech by introducing a low-cost version of the company’s Quest 3 virtual reality headset, which is set to kickstart sales in mid-October. But he seemed more upbeat than in previous discussions, indicating a positive outlook for his vision ahead.\n\n“We can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look,” Zuckerberg boasted to a large audience. He emphasized the capabilities of Quest, including a remote desktop integration with Windows 11.\n\nMeta plans to be a leader in the AI space. Zuckerberg stated that Meta AI is on pace to be the world’s most used AI assistant by the end of 2024. Between Facebook and Instagram, the chatbot garners more than 500 million monthly active users.\n\nTo top it all off, Meta previewed their Orion Augmented Reality glasses; Zuckerberg described the prototype as “the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.” Aimed at bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds, the glasses will feature holographic displays that adapt to user surroundings.\n\nMETA Earnings and Stock Performance\n\nShares of Meta Platforms META, which are currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have surged nearly 60% this year. The world’s largest social media platform, Meta has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past seven quarters. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nBack in July, Meta reported second-quarter earnings of $5.16/share, representing a 9.8% surprise over the $4.70/share estimate. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.6%.\n\nAnalysts covering META stock are in agreement and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. Looking at 2024 as a whole, EPS estimates have been increased by 3.74% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $21.36/share, translating to a whopping 43.6% growth rate relative to last year. Meta continues to innovate and find ways to accelerate growth, a remarkable feat for a company of its size. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOption Essentials\n\nWhile there are many ways to take advantage of this bullish move, options provide us with flexibility, enabling us to tailor our strategy to the current market environment.\n\nWhen done correctly, trading options provides huge profit opportunities with limited risk making options one of the most versatile investment vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we analyze today’s trade, let’s review some option fundamentals as a refresher. There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I’ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it is to work over the long run.\n\nOptions are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price, which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a particular security, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option, whether a put or call, is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.\n\nThese contracts are valid for a specific period of time which ends on expiration day. There are weekly options, monthly options, and even LEAPS options which are longer-term options that have an expiration date of greater than one year.\n\nOption spreads can be an extremely effective strategy. Debit spreads are implemented by purchasing a call option and selling a related call option with a higher strike price. These types of trades are limited risk trades because the short option is ‘covered’ by the option purchase.\n\nBelow we’re going to explore a call option spread strategy.\n\nThe Power of Option Spreads\n\nMeta currently meets our criteria for initiating a bullish call option spread position. META stock is trending well and outperforming the market this year. The company is witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions, which our research has shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices.\n\nThe table below displays the risk/reward profile for this trade. META is trading at $564.63/share at the time of this writing. This trade involves purchasing the November 500-strike call at 77.8 points, and selling the November 520-strike call at 62.8 points for a total cost of 15 points. As option contracts represent 100 shares of the underlying security, this would represent a total cost of $1,500 per spread (orange box). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe top (blue) row in the lower section shows the performance of META stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration. The last (purple) row shows the corresponding percentage return for our debit spread trade. We can see that regardless of whether META increases in price, remains flat, or even loses 5% from our entry, our option spread trade will produce a 33.3% return.\n\nThese are types of odds I like to have in my favor when trading options.\n\nAdvantages of Spread Trading\n\n1) The Option Sale Provides Downside Protection\n\nThe sale of a call option results in cash being credited to your brokerage account. This reduces the cost basis of the option purchase and provides downside protection in the event the price of the underlying stock declines.\n\n2) Risk is Reduced\n\nIn the META trade just presented, the sale of the 520-strike call reduced the risk of the 500-strike purchase from $7,780 to just $1,500 per contract.\n\n3) Allows Us to Maintain Positions During Volatile Markets\n\nThe downside protection provided by the call option sale helps us maintain our spread trade during heightened volatility. Naked option purchases may force us to sell early in order to prevent large losses.\n\n4) Spreads Can Be Profitable If Stock Goes Up or Down\n\nOption spreads can be profitable even if the underlying stock decreases or remains flat, providing us with an entirely new dimension of money-making opportunities.\n\nRemember that the call option sold through this strategy profits as the price of the underlying stock declines, providing us with a cushion during market pullbacks.\n\nOption spreads are a safe way to use the leverage inherent in options. Your risk is limited to the price paid for the spread. The call option spread strategy is an excellent way to take advantage of the bullish move in META shares.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta stock hits all-time high as Wall Street bets on AI vision",
        "content": "Meta stock (META) traded at a new all-time intraday high Thursday, following a developer event that put its artificial intelligence ambitions on display. Shares rose as high as $577 after the bell before edging down slightly to be up just under 1%, or around $573, mid-morning.\n\nAt Meta Connect 2024 on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Meta’s newest AI model, Llama 3.2. The tech giant also revealed its new “Orion” augmented reality glasses, as well as its latest Ray Ban smart glasses and mixed-reality Quest headset.\n\nMeta has raced to catch up with competitors in the AI space — fellow Big Tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as well as the startup and AI leader OpenAI. And while it’s not as popular as ChatGPT, Meta claimed in April that its AI has an equivalent of 185 million weekly active users, close behind ChatGPT’s 200 million.\n\nMeta released an AI model, Llama 3.1, this summer, which it claimed could outperform OpenAI’s models in several areas. Llama 3.2 is another stride forward for Meta as it looks to take on OpenAI and other AI players. It’s Meta’s first open-source model that can process images, charts, graphs, and text, and it will enable developers using Llama 3.2 to build more complex applications.\n\nThe company said Llama 3.2 is competitive with OpenAI’s GPT4o-mini and outperforms Google’s AI model Gemma by some metrics. And its AI assistant available on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook can now speak in the voices of celebrities including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta had “reached an inflection point in the industry” in which its AI model, Llama, is “starting to become something of an industry standard.” Mark Zuckerberg smiles while speaking at the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnalysts contend that Meta is well-positioned among its competitors. “We believe Meta Connect reflected Meta’s ambitions to be one of the leading AI companies and to shape the industry,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a note to investors Thursday morning.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg showcased Meta's AI future at Meta Connect leaving us more bullish on Meta's consumer & enterprise AI opportunities,” wrote Jefferies analysts. “On the enterprise, Llama is becoming a serious contender and we see momentum building with its new multimodal capabilities.”\n\nBank of America analysts on Thursday raised its price target on the stock to $630. JPMorgan expects Meta shares to rise even higher, to $640, while Jefferies reiterated its price target of $600. The average Wall Street forecast for Meta's stock price over the next 12 months is a bit lower at $583, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 88% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock recommend buying it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it may take a while for Meta to reap the full benefits of its AI innovations. Jefferies analysts noted a “potential multi-year lag between investments and revenue” but said they are \"confident in Meta's proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s costly Reality Labs division, which works on its metaverse products, continues to lose the company billions of dollars. The team’s hefty spending has cost the company $50 billion so far, and JPMorgan analysts project Reality Labs will lose Meta another $23 billion in 2025.\n\nMeta may not have fully monetized its AI advancements just yet, but its moves in the AI space have certainly boosted its stock. Meta is part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks, which have rallied to unprecedented price levels over the past year. Meta stock is up by nearly 91% over the last year, including over 60% in 2024.

        "title": "All eyes are on Meta's smart glasses, but questions persist over its secretive AR project",
        "content": "Halfway through the keynote speech during the Meta (META) Connect event on Wednesday, Vice President of AR, Alex Himel, walked on stage with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.\n\n\"This is Orion,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced next to him, pulling out Meta's augmented reality glasses. \"Our first fully functioning prototype — and if I do say so, the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\"\n\nInvestors finally got a sneak peak of a moonshot from the money-losing Reality Labs division inside Meta. The project has been shrouded in secrecy, after nearly a decade of development and billions of dollars in research and build. It also arrives as Wall Street increasingly questions the spending at the division, after it burned through over $50 billion since 2020.\n\nZuckerberg hopes Orion can bridge the gap between the digital and real world, and eventually replace smartphones. But its debut may be further away than Meta bulls think.\n\nMeta has previously said it's targeting 2027 to begin shipping its long-awaited AR glasses. Yet several insiders who worked on the teams building Orion exclusively told Yahoo Finance that despite the product being \"magical\" and \"precious,\" it may never hit consumers' hands or give a return to Meta's investment.\n\nAccording to two former engineers with knowledge of the project, the initial goal was to build approximately 1,000 units, which quickly turned into only a few hundred. Out of those, people familiar with the project estimate fewer than twenty units actually turn on and show an image — taking the average cost of just the working prototypes into the \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars.\n\nZuckerberg's expectation was for some of the materials used to build Orion to drop in price over the last few years. That didn't happen as hoped (partly due to trade restrictions), meaning some of the materials will have to be changed for future versions to be financially sustainable.\n\n\"They don’t know whether the technology will work and whether it’ll ever work at the price point anyone can afford,\" said a former lead engineer who asked not to be identified. \"Right now, they don't have material that they can make this with at a reasonable cost.\"\n\nOrion is made up of three main parts: the glasses, a wristband, and a puck that powers the device's graphics and connectivity. The puck is referred to as the \"central compute,\" people familiar with the project said.\n\nIts chief materials are a silicon carbide wave-guide sandwiched between two protective lenses, seven cameras, two micro-LED projectors, and custom silicon — one of the more expensive parts of the product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe glasses also feature magnesium frames to help keep the weight down. According to people familiar with the project, the wave-guides each cost around $10,000.\n\nZuckerberg is aware of the challenges ahead. He ended his keynote saying they're focused on key changes to Orion before they offer it as a consumer product.\n\n\"For now, I think the right way to look at Orion is a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how committed Zuckerberg and Meta are to Orion. Former employees tell Yahoo Finance that Meta moved a significant portion of its AR development team from the Orion project into its Ray-Ban smart glasses division earlier this month.\n\nAnd investor questions on the overall outlook of Reality Labs are mounting. A dozen former high level employees previously told Yahoo Finance the division has been mired in mismanagement.\n\nIn a new note out Thursday following the event, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth projected Reality Labs losses of $19 billion in 2024 and $23 billion in 2025.\n\nReality Labs lost $16.1 billion in 2023, according to company filings, while contributing less than $2 billion to revenue. By comparison, the company's Family of Apps segment — which includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — pulled in $62.9 billion in profits.\n\n\"The potential for Meta to pull back on Reality Labs spending and losses has been a frequent topic in our recent discussions with investors. And while it’s difficult to discern between a shift of a few billions dollars, we don’t come away from Connect thinking that Meta will pare back Reality Labs losses,\" Anmuth said.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Meta (META)\n\nShares in Meta rose in pre-market trading on Wednesday as the company revealed its latest augmented reality (AR) glasses during its annual developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg showcased a prototype of the new glasses, named Orion, marking the next phase of Meta's push into wearable technology.\n\nThe Orion glasses are designed to project digital images of media, people, games, and communications into the real world, offering an immersive blend of physical and digital experiences. Zuckerberg framed the product as part of Meta’s broader strategy to transition from desktops and smartphones toward eyewear capable of performing similar tasks.\n\n“A lot of people have said this is the craziest technology they’ve ever seen,” Zuckerberg said during his keynote speech, wearing a shirt emblazoned with “Aut Zuck aut nihil,” an adaptation of Julius Caesar’s Latin motto meaning “Either Zuck or nothing.”\n\nA pre-recorded demo highlighted the glasses' capabilities, including users playing a virtual Pong game and conducting video chats through augmented reality.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise despite UK consumer confidence hit by budget fears\n\nMeta also doubled down on its artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions at the event, unveiling new products and features for its AI chatbot, Meta AI. The bot will now generate personalised images automatically for users, integrating these AI creations into Facebook and Instagram feeds, the company announced.\n\nAdditionally, Meta introduced a major upgrade to Meta AI, which will now respond to voice commands. Users will also be able to choose from celebrity voices, including Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell, and Awkwafina.\n\n“I think that voice is going to be a way more natural way of interacting with AI than text,” Zuckerberg said, highlighting the company’s vision for a more intuitive user experience as AI technology becomes more integrated into daily life.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel shares were trending in pre-market trading as the chipmaker rolled out its latest AI chips, despite financial turmoil that could lead to the company being bought.\n\nIntel launched its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator and its most powerful Xeon 6 CPU, providing them to server manufacturers for customer delivery.\n\nThe product releases came just days after reports surfaced that Qualcomm (QCOM) had approached Intel with a proposal for a friendly takeover, while Apollo Global Management had offered to invest up to $5bn (£4.1bn) in the company. The reports, based on anonymous sources and first published by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, sparked fresh speculation about Intel’s future.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nIntel is grappling with a series of financial setbacks that are among the most severe in its 56-year history. Its market capitalisation has shrunk to a third of its value from four years ago, and its share price has plummeted by nearly 60%. As the company faces its third consecutive year of declining sales, it is exploring various strategic options.\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nShares in BP were lower following a slump in crude (BZ=F) prices after a report that Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its unofficial price target of $100 a barrel, and reports that the oil major is facing production issues in Europe.\n\nBP has faced delays in restarting its Europoort oil refinery in Rotterdam after a power outage earlier this month, according to recent reports. The incident, which occurred on 3 September, involved damage to a power recovery turbine, causing an extended shutdown.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nRepairs have now been completed after taking approximately two weeks, but the disruption has slowed the resumption of operations at the facility. The Europoort refinery, one of BP's major European sites, has a processing capacity of 400,000 barrels per day and features two main crude distillation units.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices fell on Thursday, reversing earlier gains, following reports that top exporter Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its informal $100 per barrel price target in anticipation of expanding crude production.\n\nH&M (HM-B.ST)\n\nShares of H&M tumbled as much as 8% on Thursday after the world’s second-largest listed fashion retailer posted a miss on operating profit and abandoned its earnings margin target.\n\nThe Swedish retailer cautioned that its operating margin would fall short of its 10% target for the year, citing unseasonably cold weather across the continent in June.\n\nOperating profit for the third quarter reached 3.5bn Swedish krona (£259m), significantly below analyst expectations of 4.6bn krona (£341m).\n\nChief executive Daniel Ervér acknowledged that elevated living costs had also impacted performance, noting that “consumers’ living costs have remained high during the year.”\n\nH&M also abandoned its earnings margin target for 2024, following an earlier warning of increasingly challenging market conditions.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Social Networking Stocks Q2 Earnings: Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND) Best of the Bunch\n\nWrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the social networking stocks, including Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND) and its peers.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 5 social networking stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.2% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 0.9% above.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nWhile some social networking stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 1.5% since the latest earnings results.\n\nBest Q2: Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND)\n\nHelping residents figure out what's happening on their block in real time, Nextdoor (NYSE:KIND) is a social network that connects neighbors with each other and with local businesses.\n\nNextdoor reported revenues of $63.29 million, up 11.3% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 8.5%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts’ user estimates. Nextdoor Total Revenue\n\nNextdoor pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. The company reported 45.13 million monthly active users, up 8.4% year on year. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $2.50.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nextdoor?

The business had a satisfactory quarter with strong sales guidance for the next quarter.\n\nStory continues Meta Total Revenue\n\nMeta scored the fastest revenue growth among its peers. The company reported 3.27 billion daily active users, up 6.5% year on year. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 21.6% since reporting.

It was a weaker quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and slow revenue growth.\n\nSnap delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group.

This result was in line with analysts’ expectations. Zooming out, it was a strong quarter as it recorded underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts’ user estimates.\n\nThe company reported 522 million monthly active users, up 12.3% year on year.

It's not going to be a major thing. I'd say it's more of a symbolic thing. We want to have this be a long-term partnership, and as part of that, I thought that this would be a nice gesture,\" Zuckerberg said in a video interview published late on Wednesday on The Verge.\n\n\"I fundamentally believe in them a lot. I think that they're going to go from being the premier glasses company in the world to one of the major technology companies in the world,\" he added.\n\nEarlier this month, EssilorLuxottica said it had extended its partnership with Meta for developing smart eyewear.\n\nIn July, EssilorLuxottica confirmed that the tech giant might invest in the company, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the two companies had discussed Meta taking a 5% stake in the French-Italian group.\n\nFacebook owner Meta showed off its first working prototype of augmented-reality glasses, called Orion, during its annual Connect conference on Wednesday.\n\n(Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Time to Buy META Stock as it Near All-Time Highs?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms META stock has now soared over +60% this year, hitting all-time highs of $576 a share on Wednesday. Surely investors are wondering if another leg higher is in store for the social media pioneer’s stock.\n\nTo address the plausibility of such, let’s see what’s been moving Meta's stock higher and gauge if there is indeed more upside in META from current levels. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMETA Stock: Strong Financial Performance\n\nAs illustrated in the EPS surprise chart above, Meta has surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for seven consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 12.61% in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nPointing to the company’s increased probability, Meta most recently reported Q2 EPS of $5.16 in July which beat estimates by 10% and soared 60% from $3.23 per share in the comparative quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMETA Earns Positive Analyst Ratings\n\nStemming from Meta’s strong financial performance and further boosting its stock is that analysts have remained bullish on the tech giant’s outlook. Notably, of the 45 brokers covering Meta’s stock and providing data to Zacks Investment Research, 39 have a strong buy rating.\n\nMeta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMETA's Innovation and Product Expansion\n\nIn regards to the positive sentiment, analysts have remained optimistic about Meta’s opportunities in artificial intelligence. Hosting its annual conference today, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated Meta AI is one of the most used AI assistants in the world with nearly 500 million monthly users.\n\nThe “Meta Connect 2024” event was highlighted by new Meta AI updates including natural voice interactions outside of text. The AI voice interactions are now accessible on all of the company’s main apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook) and will compete against Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Gemini Live and OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode.\n\nMeta will also be expanding its business AI solutions to help businesses better serve their customers, offer support, and facilitate commerce. In addition to this, Meta unveiled updated versions of its virtual reality headset (Quest 3S VR ) and gave a glimpse of its Orion augmented reality glasses which it touts as the most advanced AR glasses ever made, combining the look and feel of regular glasses with immersive AR capabilities.\n\nMonitoring META's Stock Valuation\n\nOne reason for the explosion in Meta shares has been the company’s attractive valuation relative to many of its big tech peers. META currently trades at 26.3X forward earnings which is not a stretched premium to the S&P 500’s 24.2X.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, META still trades at a sharp discount to its decade-long high of 74.5X forward earnings but slightly above the median of 25X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAfter such a stellar year to date rally, Meta Platforms stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although there could be better buying opportunities ahead it would be no surprise if META continued to rise with it noteworthy that the Average Zacks Price Target of $579.19 a share still suggests 3% upside.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Debuts Orion AR Glasses as Eventual Smartphone Rival",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. debuted its first pair of augmented reality glasses — devices that show a combined view of the digital and physical worlds, a key step in Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s goal of one day offering a hands-free alternative to the smartphone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\n\nThe new glasses, introduced Wednesday and called Orion, look like thick, black reading glasses, but have lenses that can display text messages, video calls, and even YouTube videos onto the user’s field of vision. They are prototypes that are not for sale, but will be used internally at Meta for testing and improving the product.\n\nAn accompanying wristband that detects nerve stimulation and cameras built into the frames that track eye movement allow Orion wearers to “click” or “scroll” on the display using just their hands.\n\nThe glasses represent nearly a decade of technological advancement and significant financial investment at Meta. They also offer a glimpse into Zuckerberg’s vision for the future of technology, which has cost the company tens of billions of dollars over the past four years alone.\n\nMeta is already selling Ray-Ban branded smart glasses equipped with cameras and speakers, but Zuckerberg believes that AR glasses will become a kind of mobile, hands-free computer that could one day rival smartphones as the preferred way to communicate and interact online. If smart glasses eventually become mainstream, Meta hopes to be a major player in that new industry, which would also help the company reduce its reliance on competitors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to deliver its products to consumers.\n\nThat goal is still years away despite the Orion prototype, which was debuted at Meta’s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California. The company had hoped to make this version of the device available to the public, but executives said it’s not yet small enough or stylish enough. Those same challenges have plagued similar efforts by other tech companies over the years, including Google and Microsoft Corp.\n\nSnap Inc. unveiled its own pair of AR glasses earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\n\nEventually, Meta executives believe they will be able to make the glasses thin and powerful enough that general consumers will buy them. The goal is to bring Orion to market in the “next few years” for the price of a “high end laptop or smartphone,” said Rahul Prasad, a senior director of product management at Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Any kind of prior attempt at AR has been a headset, goggles, helmets,” he said. “We want to get to glasses.”\n\nFor now, Meta will continue to build and refine the glasses internally until they are ready for public sale. Hundreds of Meta employees have been testing the Orion glasses. The company plans to expand that group considerably now that they’ve been debuted publicly.\n\nUnlike competing products, such as Apple’s Vision Pro headset, Meta’s Orion glasses don’t require a bulky head strap or battery pack to operate. Orion has seven cameras, including two for tracking eye movements, which allow users to control the display using visible hand gestures. Orion works best, though, when paired with an accompanying wristband, which uses electromyography to detect much more subtle hand movements so users can control the glasses with minor finger movements.\n\nMeta designed and produced more than 10 different computer chips embedded in Orion, part of a plan to reduce energy consumption for the glasses but also to decrease the amount of heat generated so that they aren’t warm to the touch. Instead of glass, Orion’s lenses are made of silicon carbide, a material popular in some electric vehicles, which is lighter than glass and also helps bend light at extreme angles, Prasad said.\n\nNew Quest VR Headset\n\nMeta also announced a new, cheaper version of its Quest virtual reality headset, freshening its effort to persuade consumers to spend more time using virtual and augmented reality to play games, watch videos and chat with others.\n\nThe Quest 3S headset has much of the same functionality as the existing Quest 3 device but offers less memory and is several hundred dollars cheaper. The headset will be available in stores beginning Oct. 15 and will cost as little as $300, compared to the $500 Quest 3 devices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known for his passion, including for ancient Rome, and on Wednesday he wore a shirt that played on his own ambitions as his company launched what he described as the best glasses in the world.\n\nAt Meta's annual Connect event in Menlo Park, California, Zuckerberg wore a custom T-shirt with the Latin phrase \"aut Zuck aut nihil,\" or \"all Zuck or all nothing,\" as he revealed the first working prototype of Meta's augmented-reality glasses.\n\nThe phrase was a play on \"aut Caesar aut nihil,\" which means \"either a Caesar or nothing,\" or more simply \"all or nothing.\"\n\nThe saying, indicative of grand ambition, was a personal motto of Italian Renaissance Prince Cesare Borgia and was possibly coined by Julius Caesar himself, according to some scholars.\n\nZuckerberg has long been interested in the Roman Empire. He spent his honeymoon in Rome and two of his children, August and Aurelia, are named after emperors Augustus and Marcus Aurelius.\n\nEarlier this year on his 40th birthday, Zuckerberg posted photos on social media in which he wore a T-shirt with the words \"Carthago delenda est,\" meaning \"Carthage must be destroyed,\" referring to Rome's great rival.\n\nZuckerberg's latest fashion statement comes as Meta Platforms seeks to overcome past tech industry failures and develop augmented-reality devices that are embraced by the masses.\n\nWhile Meta's new Orion AR glasses are not yet available for users and for now are mostly for internal testing, they represent Zuckerberg's vision for products that would bring the virtual world into the real one.\n\n\"The way to think about AR glasses is as a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said on Wednesday. \"They exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman focus on value, and others like Ken Fisher focus on growth, Asness’ fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\n\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock’s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock’s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock’s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\n\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital’s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\n\nThese returns ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\n\nLooking at the returns for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are plotted over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\n\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund’s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return’s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022 according to Bloomberg,\n\nAQR’s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey’s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund’s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as Citadel Wellington, Point72, and Millennium 5.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\n\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness’ top stock picks, it’s also important to see how his firms’ funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed’s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% – 3.50% by 2025 end.\n\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR’s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index’s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark’s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks “considered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe” has been the way to go so far in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital’s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey’s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\n\nAQR Funds’ Latest Investment Stake: $811 million\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. With more than 3.2 billion people using its platform as of March 2024, the firm enjoys a considerable presence in the social media industry. This is key for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), as it enables it to ensure that advertisers are eager to run their ads on its platform. Ad revenue is one of the biggest revenue streams for the firm, and it has grown in importance as of late due to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s aggressive AI investments. Key drivers for its share price include revenue per user, the ability to monetize AI, and maintain or grow its user base. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also using AI to enable advertisers to autonomously create campaigns and general users to make use of AI through AI Studio. Additionally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s forward price to earnings ratio of 22.32 means that the share growth might be rapid.\n\nSince monetizing AI is one of the keys to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s hypothesis, here’s what Evercore’s Mark Mahaney had to say during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\n“If you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that’s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.”\n\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list. While we acknowledge META's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta has unveiled its first pair of augmented reality (AR) glasses, which use holograms to overlay digital content on to the real world around the wearer.\n\nAnnounced during the tech giant’s Meta Connect event, the company said the prototype device called Orion “might be the most challenging consumer electronics device produced since the smartphone”.\n\nSo far, AR devices have been headsets – such as Apple’s Vision Pro – in order to house all the technology required to power a wearable device capable of projecting holograms in front of a wearer’s eyes.\n\nBut Meta said Orion was the result of “breakthrough inventions in virtually every field of modern computing” and was “packed with entirely new technologies” around display and computer chips in order to run the same experiences currently found in headsets on a pair of glasses.\n\nThe device can be controlled using voice, eye movement and hand gestures. Orion will overlay digital content on to the real world in front of the wearer (Meta/PA)\n\nMeta said it was opening up prototype testing for its own staff and “select, external audiences” so it can “learn, iterate, and build towards our consumer AR glasses product line, which we plan to begin shipping in the near future”.\n\nThe announcement was the most eye-catching in an array of new products and tools announced by the Facebook and Instagram parent firm during its event, including a new version of its Meta Quest headset.\n\nMeta has been making large strides into artificial intelligence (AI) and it confirmed that it was adding voice interaction to its Meta AI tools for the first time – initially rolling out in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nNew versions of Meta’s open-source AI models – Llama 3.2 – were also announced.\n\nIndustry expert Mike Proulx, vice president research director at analyst firm Forrester, said the announcement of Orion had the potential to be “revolutionary” for the sector.\n\n“There was a stark contrast in Mark Zuckerberg’s excitement when he talked about AI and glasses versus when he talked about Meta Quest,” he said.\n\n“It’s clear that Meta’s future is AI and glasses.\n\n“VR headsets, despite Meta’s assertion, won’t go mainstream. They’re too cumbersome and people can only tolerate them in short bursts.\n\n“Glasses, however, put computing power directly into a common and familiar form factor. As the smart tech behind these glasses mature, they have the potential to disrupt everyday consumers’ interactions with brands.\n\n“Meta’s Orion holographic prototype sets the stage for a future where a revolutionary 3D computing platform is within reach and can actually be useful to the everyday consumer.”",

        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off some impressive upgrades to the company's hit Ray-Ban Meta Glasses during the company's Meta Connect event on Wednesday, including the ability to translate live conversations, offer continuous talking features, and recognize the world around you.\n\nThe updates make the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, which start at $299, a far more intelligent piece of technology — and give them similar features to smartphone-based AI apps like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Circle to Search and Gemini and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming improved Siri and visual intelligence.\n\nAccording to Meta, you'll now be able to do things like ask the glasses to remember where you parked. Or, if you want to know about landmarks in a city you're visiting, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses can tell you more about a statue, building, or location when asked. At the grocery store and want to know what to make for dinner? Meta says the glasses can suggest what you should make based on what you're looking at while walking the aisles. Meta is updating its Ray-Ban Meta Glasses with new AI capabilities. (Meta) (Meta)\n\nThe company also says it's adding real-time translation to the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses. Zuckerberg showed off the feature during a live demo. And while there was a small delay between when a person stopped talking and the glasses began translating, it certainly appeared to work well. In fact, live-translating a conversation with the glasses looks far more natural than doing the same thing while holding up a smartphone.\n\nFinally, Meta showed off a new limited-edition transparent design for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses that lets you see the device's internal components. It gives the glasses a late-90s/early-2000s look that more tech companies should adopt. (Says the guy who grew up during that time.)\n\nIn addition to updates for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, the company also announced its first AI vision models. The new open-source models, called Llama 3.2 11B and 90B, are designed to be able to understand images like charts and graphs.\n\nThe idea is to give developers the ability to create apps using the new models that can, for example, provide a hiker with information about when a particular hike gets steeper by having the AI read over a map of the route.\n\nMeta's AI work has quickly made it one of the top open-source AI companies around. And if it can keep on innovating, it could stand among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

They eye a prototype of next-gen AR glasses with a bigger focus on mixed reality and augmented reality.\n\nThey expect AI product launches for core apps, announcements on Meta AI, new AI messaging capabilities, and an AI subscription product.\n\nAccording to a Tom’s Guide report, a Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) store display reveals details about the affordable headset, including its resolution, bundled controllers, and a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow. The headset could include both controllers and a game.\n\nThe headset display highlights a resolution of 1,832 x 1,920 per eye, lower than the higher-end Quest 3’s 4K displays. It also features 256GB storage, up from prior expectations of 128GB, as per Tom’s Guide.\n\nThe higher storage could cost $50-$100 more. The leak notes that the more expensive Quest 3 will only include the game. Meta Connect could also finally provide an official launch date for Batman: Arkham Shadow per Tom’s Guide conjecture.\n\nLast year, at Connect 2023, Meta unveiled the Quest 3 mixed-reality headset powered by Qualcomm Inc’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip with a Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) 365 integration.\n\nThe company also launched Ray-Ban smart glasses featuring a 2MP wide-angle camera, five mics, and built-in speakers. Connect 2023 also witnessed the debut of Meta AI and the revelation that Xbox Cloud Gaming was coming to Quest 3.\n\nOne of the most hyped and premium AR/VR headsets, Apple Vision Pro, is also having trouble justifying its $3,500 price tag.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\n\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\n\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy.

        "title": "Meta readies AR glasses reveal at Connect event",
        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\n(Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta prepared on Wednesday to kick off its annual Connect conference at its California headquarters, where it is expected to preview its first augmented reality glasses and announce updates to its existing virtual reality and artificial intelligence products.\n\nAmong those AI updates is an audio upgrade offering users the option to select a voice for Meta's ChatGPT-like chatbot, including the ability to make it sound like celebrities including Judi Dench and John Cena, Reuters reported on Monday.\n\nThe augmented reality reveal is a long time in the making for Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who positioned AR technology as a sort of magnum opus when he first pivoted the world’s biggest social media company toward building immersive “metaverse” systems in 2021.\n\nHowever, Meta has struggled to overcome technical challenges with its AR project since then, prompting the head of the company’s metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division to acknowledge last year that a product it could viably bring to market was “still a few years away - a few, to put it lightly.\"\n\nThe company has been plowing tens of billions of dollars into its investments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other metaverse technologies, driving up its capital expense forecast for 2024 to a record high of between $37 billion and $40 billion.\n\nIts metaverse unit Reality Labs lost $8.3 billion in the first half of this year, according to the most recent disclosures. It lost $16 billion last year.\n\nThe social media giant is planning for the first generation of the AR glasses this year to be distributed only internally and to a select group of developers, with each device costing tens of thousands of dollars to produce, according to a source familiar with the project.\n\nMeta aims to ship its first commercial AR glasses to consumers in 2027, by which point technical breakthroughs should bring down the cost of production, the source said.\n\nThe source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss company plans.\n\nZuckerberg appeared to confirm that approach, describing the AR work and telling an audience at a live taping of the Acquired podcast in San Francisco that Meta was “pretty close to being able to show off the first prototype that we have of that.”\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the plans.\n\nIn the meantime, Meta has leaned into an unexpected interim success on the road to AR with its camera-equipped Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nRiding a wave of excitement around emerging generative AI technology, the company announced at last year’s Connect conference that it was adding an AI-powered digital assistant to the glasses, turning a once-forgotten device into the most popular AI wearable on the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Meta has not disclosed sales numbers for the smart glasses, the CEO of Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica said this summer that more of the new generation sold in a few months than the old ones did in two years. Market research firm IDC estimates that more than 700,000 pairs of the glasses have shipped since the update last year.\n\nMeta recently extended its partnership with EssilorLuxottica and contemplated a possible investment in the eyewear company, prompting speculation that the AR glasses may also bear the Ray-Ban name. More immediately, Meta’s roadmap for the smart glasses includes plans for a next generation that will feature a viewfinder capable of displaying basic text and images through the lenses.\n\nIt has been shipping software updates this year enhancing the AI assistant’s capabilities on the existing glasses, including an update in April that enabled the agent to identify and converse about objects seen by the wearer.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Shri Navaratnam)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is spurning the European Union’s voluntary artificial intelligence safety pledge that’s planned as a stopgap measure before the bloc’s AI Act rules take full force in 2027.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport NY’s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\n\nMeta could join the so-called AI Pact initiative at a later stage, a spokesperson for the company said by email on Tuesday.\n\nMeta’s position contrasts with Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which both confirmed through spokespeople that they will sign the pledge. The company stands out from its Big Tech peers because its AI model, Llama, has open source features that are designed to be repurposed by users with relatively little control from the developer. That could make it more difficult to comply with requirements to map risks with the tools.\n\nFrance’s open-source AI startup Mistral, which in June reached a €5.8 billion ($6.5 billion) valuation, will not sign it, according to a spokesperson.\n\nThe EU is seeking to set standards for regulating the fast-developing field of AI, while not stifling innovation in the emerging technology and risk ceding the industry to US firms. The non-binding pledge asks developers to comply with the key obligations of the AI Act before they become law.\n\nCompanies that sign it will commit to follow a list of practices that mirror the AI Act’s principles, including charting whether their AI tools are likely to be deployed in “high-risk” situations, such as education, employment or policing. The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, will unveil the full list of signatories on Wednesday.\n\nThe AI Pact is not legally binding, and companies won’t face any consequences for not signing. Those that do could avoid potential clashes with the EU, which has been known to name and shame technology companies that spurn its voluntary initiatives.\n\nElon Musk’s Twitter Inc. – later renamed X – left the EU’s non-binding anti-disinformation code of practice in 2023. Thierry Breton, who was the bloc’s tech chief at the time, quipped “you can run but you can’t hide” in a tweet.\n\nCompanies that join the pact will “build trust among customers, investors, and regulators,” said Ceyhun Pehlivan, co-lead of tech and intellectual property in the Linklaters’ law practice in Madrid. Holdouts might “face peer pressure and risk being singled out for not joining,” he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta in July announced it would delay the introduction of its next generation of models in the EU “due to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Threats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg is now in an exclusive club with only two other members: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos",
        "content": "It’s one thing to be a billionaire. Only 2,781 members of the world’s population, which is nearing 8 billion people, have reached that status. And even fewer people have a multibillion-dollar net worth, with a select few reaching the coveted $100 billion position.\n\nBut now there’s an even more illustrious camp: the $200 billion club. And only three of tech’s biggest leaders have reached that summit: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and now, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg, however, not only just broke into the $200 billion club—he’s also the biggest winner on the list having accumulated dozens of billions in wealth this year.\n\nZuckerberg’s wealth has ballooned by an incredible $72.2 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, bringing his total net worth to $200 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has had the second-biggest jump in net worth this year, gaining $58 billion in wealth. Growth aside, Musk has the highest net worth with $265 billion to his name, with Bezos tracking behind him at $216 billion.\n\nThis places Zuckerberg ahead of other major tech executives including Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison and former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.\n\n\"I define our strategy as if we can learn faster than every other company, we're going to win,\" Zuckerberg said during a taping of the Acquired podcast last week. \"We're going to build a better product than everyone else because we're going to get it out first or early. You learn faster.\"\n\nWhile Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook 20 years ago, only takes a $1 salary, he makes up for it in “other compensation” and his massive stake in Meta. He’s the largest shareholder of Facebook’s parent company, owning about 345.5 million shares, according to Meta’s April proxy statement. Plus, he took home $24.4 million in “other compensation” this year. Much of that other compensation goes toward protecting Zuckerberg, much as with other high-profile CEOs.\n\n“We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” Meta wrote in the SEC filing.\n\nMeta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment regarding Zuckerberg’s net worth.\n\nZuckerberg’s push for ‘efficiency’\n\nMeta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, has performed well this year. Since the start of 2024, Meta’s stock is up a jarring 60%, and an even more impressive 85% year over year. It opened trade at more than $557 per share on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nZuckerberg credits the company’s focus on AI for Meta’s strong performance this year.\n\n“Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,” Zuckerberg said in an earnings statement in July. Indeed, revenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion in Q2.\n\nWhile AI has been a boon for the company, Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta has been a challenge for many of its other workers and for some of its biggest projects, including augmented reality. This cost-cutting initiative started in February 2023 and has resulted in mass layoffs from the tech giant.\n\n“This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAbout 10 months ago, someone shared their investing journey on Reddit's r/investing community (with over 2.7 million members), telling how they started from nothing and reached about $200,000 in 10 years.\n\nThe Redditor said that after graduating from college, he decided to set up automatic contributions from his bank account to his newly created stock investing account on eTrade in 2013. At first, these contributions were as little as $100. On Dec. 1, 2020, the combined value of the investor's Roth and traditional brokerage accounts was just over $100,000.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market. This platform allows accredited investors to invest in commercial real estate, invest today for a 1% boost.\n\nBut here is the most interesting part of the story: it took this investor about seven years to go from $0 to $100,000 and just three years to reach $200,000.\n\n\"You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testament to that fact. My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire,\" the Redditor added.\n\n\"Don't Rush the Process\"\n\nThe investor said the secret to a successful investing journey is patience and holding on to quality investments.\n\n\"For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don’t rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won’t make it. But if you're patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible.\"\n\nThe investor said he's still sticking with his goals, contributing about $1,000 monthly in stock investments. He said he tried day trading for some time, but it often resulted in \"nasty losses.\"\n\n\"Stick to Profitable Companies\"\n\nThe investor said he found success by buying individual stocks based on technical and fundamental factors.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however, I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there are opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices, I jump on it. There's really nothing super special to it.\"\n\nWhile this investor did not share the exact details of his latest portfolio, he mentioned a few stocks he currently owns or has owned in the past.\n\nApple\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAP) was one of the stocks in the portfolio of the Redditor who increased his wealth from $0 to $200,000 in about 10 years. Over the past five years, Apple shares have gained about 327%.\n\nWall Street analysts have voiced concerns about an expected lackluster demand for the new iPhone. However, T-Mobile's Chief Executive Officer Mike Sievert recently said that the new model's sales are higher than last year's and further activity is expected when the company launches Apple Intelligence.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of the key stocks in the portfolio of the 35-year-old Redditor who saw his wealth rise over 10 years. Over the past five years, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has gained about 196%.\n\nD.A. Davidson recently started covering Meta Platforms with a Buy rating, saying the company can become a leader in the open source world thanks to its AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nCostco\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is a defensive stock popular among investors looking to build an all-season portfolio. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) shares are up 216% over the past five years. The company has increased its dividends for nearly two decades.\n\nHowever, Redburn Atlantic earlier this month downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy on valuation concerns.\n\nHome Depot\n\nHome Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) is another solid dividend growth stock in the portfolio of the Redditor whose wealth rose from nothing to $200,000 in a decade. The home improvement equipment company increased its dividend for 15 straight years and its shares rose about 74% over the last five years.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

McDonald’s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is ramping up promotional efforts and extending its cheaper meals to woo customers who remained on the sidelines amid rising inflation. Evercore said in the latest note that the company's foot traffic rebounded in the back half of August because of these efforts.\n\nDraft Kings\n\nDraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is another interesting stock that helped the 35-year-old Redditor achieve wealth growth over 10 years. The gaming company's shares are up about 300% over the past five years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was one of the multi-baggers in the portfolio of the Redditor who saw his wealth grow in 10 years as the chipmaker's shares rose a whopping 418% over the past five years. Thanks to its AI-focused chips like MI300 and EPYC, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is seen as the second-biggest beneficiary of the AI boom after Nvidia.\n\nBank of America\n\nWith a dividend yield of about 2.5%, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is a notable dividend stock in the portfolio of the Redditor who increased his wealth from scratch to $200,000. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has increased its dividend yearly since 2009.\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains. Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, offers a Private Credit Fund.

Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Meta Stock Bulls Look to ‘Connect’ Event for Next Rally Catalyst",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. investors have already had a rewarding year. Now, their attention is on an event this week for insights into where the stock’s record-breaking rally is heading next.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nMeta’s annual Connect conference kicks off Wednesday, with industry buzz around the reveal of a prototype augmented reality eyewear product, plus the usual star turn by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. Attendees will want to hear the CEO’s latest updates on artificial intelligence applications and investment.\n\nShares of the social media company have gained more than 13% from a trough in early September, hitting an all-time high close last week. Only Nvidia Corp. has fared better among the Magnificent Seven cohort than Meta’s almost 60% advance in 2024.\n\n“Part of the reason why the stock has done as well as it has, is they’re one of the few that is tangibly benefiting from AI usage,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management.\n\nThe two-day conference should be a valuable opportunity to learn about Meta’s AI intentions, Sansoterra said, describing the Menlo Park, California-based company’s event as “a data point that, you know, gives you some color.”\n\nWhat Meta showcases could be the next potential catalyst on deck for megacap technology stocks as investors assess the longevity of the AI trade. Some still doubt the payoff from heavy spending by companies on this industry craze and, while Meta has been able to show that big outlays on AI are yielding results, capital expenditure remains under scrutiny.\n\nIn recent years, the Connect event hasn’t immediately triggered large stock swings in itself, but has foreshadowed Meta earnings releases heading into the fourth quarter. Two years ago, the gathering showcased a new headset and updates on the Metaverse, just ahead of a damaging earnings release where investors balked at Meta’s high spending on the technology.\n\nLast year, Meta announced multiple AI initiatives, including its Meta AI assistant and a slew of AI chatbots on social media. About a month later, investors again showed their displeasure at Meta’s quarterly results, as it warned about economic headwinds for advertising purchases while continuing to invest heavily in AI and virtual reality.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe mood is a little different this time round. Meta seems to have convinced investors — at least for now — that it will keep seeing payoff for pouring money into new technology. During the last earnings call, Zuckerberg successfully made the case that spending on AI is helping to improve Meta’s core business, spurring gains in its stock that outpaced its megacap peers.\n\n“The Connect conference has been more of a pivotal event for Meta, not because of the products itself, but more so from what Zuckerberg has been saying from a holistic fundamental perspective,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC.\n\nWall Street has long been bullish on Meta shares, but the Facebook owner has lately attracted increased analyst attention. Cantor Fitzgerald and DA Davidson both initiated coverage of Meta this month with buy-equivalent ratings.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan also named the company a top pick with “further potential for upward estimate revisions and an attractive valuation,” in a Sept. 4 note.\n\nMeta’s valuation partly explains why investors are still buying at record highs. The company trades at about 24 times forward earnings, roughly in line with its 10-year average and a discount to the 26-times ratio for the Nasdaq 100. It’s also cheaper than the approximately 29 times commanded by the Magnificent Seven Index.\n\n“It’s not what I would consider an expensive stock,” Sansoterra said. “But it is a stock that is clearly growing better than investors thought, even a few quarters ago.”\n\nAfter attracting some new bulls, Meta’s average price target is at a record high of about $574, implying about 3% further upside.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAs China ramps up more support to boost its ailing economy, the local internet stock sector might also see some more support. The divergence in performance between an ETF tracking Chinese internet shares and the Nasdaq QQQ ETF is among the widest thematic gaps in markets, with almost 40 percentage points of China underperformance. Concerns around online shoppers and the local economy have been too strong to allow any AI optimism to sneak into the sector for now.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nCable billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. is proposing an all-stock merger with Charter Communications Inc., one of the top pay-TV providers in the US and another of the media investor’s key holdings. Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel Corp., people familiar with the matter said, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and an alternative to a potential takeover by larger rival Qualcomm Inc. The US House approved legislation that would exempt some semiconductor manufacturing projects from federal permitting requirements, addressing concerns that environmental reviews and lawsuits will delay construction of domestic chip factories. Microsoft Corp., aiming to shore up cybersecurity after a series of damning failures, has hired new executives from places like the US government and is holding weekly meetings with its most senior executives to advance a companywide initiative to make its software more resilient.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nProgress Software\n\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Threats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK - Facebook owner Meta Platforms is planning to announce this week that it has secured deals with actors including Judi Dench, Kristen Bell and John Cena to give voice to its Meta AI chatbot, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe new audio feature will offer users the option to select a voice for Meta's ChatGPT-like digital assistant from a list of five celebrities, who also include Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, as well as several generic voice options, the person told Reuters.\n\nThe social media giant is set to announce the audio capabilities at its annual Connect conference, which starts on Wednesday, the person said.\n\nMeta is also expected to unveil a first version of its augmented-reality glasses at Connect this year and to discuss its road map for other hardware devices like its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which last year became its first product to include an audio version of the Meta AI chatbot.\n\nThe celebrity voices will start launching in the U.S. and other English-speaking markets this week across Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the source told Reuters.\n\nBloomberg first reported earlier this summer that Meta was in discussions with celebrities about using their voices for AI projects.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a promotional video featuring Cena on Instagram last week, showing the two men and several others engaging in stunts while wearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\n\nMeta has been racing to push out generative artificial intelligence products to its billions of users, as it competes against Microsoft-backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Alphabet's Google to dominate the emerging technology. As part of that, the company has been adding capabilities to its chatbot and pushing to make it a more prominent part of the experience of using its apps.\n\nOpenAI showed off a similar audio feature for its chatbot in May, but quickly ran into trouble when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the company of making it sound \"eerily similar\" to her even though she had declined to lend her voice to the project.\n\nMeta's assistant is currently capable of engaging in text chats and generating images in response to user prompts. The company last year experimented with bringing star power to the project by launching text-based \"character\" versions of the chatbot inspired by celebrities like Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg, although those never appeared to gain traction with users.\n\nMeta has since shifted focus to an AI Studio product that enables content creators on its platforms to create chatbot versions of themselves.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram are hoovering up your data to train their AI.  Here’s how to stop it",
        "content": "You don’t have to let social media services harvest your data to train their generative AI, as many companies do these days. You can opt out—if you can figure out how.\n\nThe problem was hammered home last week when tech news site 404Media reported that LinkedIn had started training its AI on its users’ posts by default, without letting users know about the change. LinkedIn is relying on the data to train AI that will help users write their posts or to recommend content to them.\n\nA social media platform hoovering up posts and personal information for their AI system isn’t entirely new. Meta has been harvesting Facebook and Instagram user data since last year, while X, formerly Twitter, has done the same since July.\n\nTikTok, whose data policies are under scrutiny amid a possible U.S. ban, hasn’t clearly stated whether it harvests user data for any generative AI tools.\n\nSocial media companies have long been criticized for how they collect, use, and share user data. In a report on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission called out social media services for their “vast surveillance” of users and “woefully inadequate” data controls.\n\nWhat’s going on at LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn opted hundreds of millions of its users outside of the EU and the UK into its AI training push without specifically telling users about it. The company told 404Media on Wednesday that it will add new language to its terms of service “shortly.\"\n\nEarlier this month, LinkedIn made a broader update to its user policy, saying that when training AI, it will “seek to minimize personal data in the data sets used to train the models” by redacting or removing personal information such as suggested posts or messages, according to a LinkedIn explanation of the policy. LinkedIn said in a statement to Fortune that it doesn’t harvest direct messages, or messages sent privately between users.\n\nLinkedIn Spokesperson Greg Snapper told Fortune that the company believes users should have control over their data.\n\n“We’ve always used some form of automation in LinkedIn products, and we’ve always been clear that users have the choice about how their data is used,” he said.\n\nHow to opt out of LinkedIn’s data harvesting for AI\n\nOpting out of LinkedIn’s data harvesting for AI requires visiting the service’s “Settings & Privacy” pages. They are accessible by clicking on your headshot in the upper right on a desktop computer, and then clicking on “Account.”\n\nYou must then click on “Data privacy” on the left sidebar, which brings up several options including “Data for Generative AI improvement.” To opt out, you toggle the switch next to the line that reads “Use my data for training content creation AI models.”\n\nStory continues\n\nLinkedIn has turned on this option by default. It means your personal data and LinkedIn content is used to train “content creation AI models” — and not just for LinkedIn, but its “affiliates” as well.\n\nLinkedIn is owned by Microsoft, which has also partnered on AI with OpenAI through Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in the maker of ChatGPT. Some of LinkedIn’s models are provided by Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI service, according to LinkedIn’s FAQ.\n\nBut opting out of AI training does nothing to reverse the company’s collection of your data prior, and LinkedIn did not specify when it started harvesting user data to train AI.\n\n“Opting out means that LinkedIn and its affiliates won’t use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train models going forward, but does not affect training that has already taken place,” according to LinkedIn’s FAQ page.\n\nIf the multi-step process is too much, Cassie Kozyrkov, former chief decision scientist at Google, shared a one-click opt-out link with her followers that lets users avoid having to hunt for the appropriate page. In her post, Kozyrkov, who LinkedIn has designated a “top voice” with more than 600,000 followers, criticized LinkedIn for its data harvesting, saying it could “clone your posts without crediting you.”\n\nHow to opt out of X and Meta’s data harvesting for AI\n\nAs for other social media platforms, opting out of data harvesting involves a similarly complicated process to LinkedIn’s.\n\nTo opt out of X using your data to train its AI chatbot Grok, go to “Settings” on a desktop computer and select “Privacy and safety.” Then, under “Data sharing and Personalization,” select Grok. Here you can uncheck the box that permits data sharing. You can also select an option to delete your conversation history with Grok.\n\nOn this page, X explains that your posts, as well as interactions, prompts, and results with Grok are fair game for training and fine-tuning its AI model, and that they may be shared with Elon Musk’s xAI, which provides the chatbot to X. The chatbot is only available to paid users but is trained on any public posts.\n\nIt’s a trickier situation for Meta, which just last week acknowledged that it has used every public Facebook and Instagram post from non-EU users since 2007 to train its AI.\n\nSince June, Meta has also been scraping interactions with chatbots on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp to train AI. Currently, if you live in a country without a data privacy law, the only way to opt out of Meta using your posts for its AI training is to set your account to private. This does not protect against data harvesting of any public posts you appear in, or your own previous posts that were already scraped.\n\nTikTok’s silence about AI training\n\nTikTok did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment about whether it builds generative AI models with user data. This summer, TikTok launched a genAI advertising tool for brands to create videos, and TikTok’s corporate owner, the Chinese tech company ByteDance, has launched various AI apps for users outside of China.\n\nUnder “Account and privacy settings,” TikTok says that it collects and analyzes face and voice information “to improve safety and user experience, to recommend and moderate content, and for analytics and demographic classification.” To stop your face and voice from being used, TikTok tells users not to upload any photos or videos of yourself and delete any that you’ve already posted.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Li-Chen Miller wasn’t even a Meta Platforms Inc. employee when she started working to fix the company’s video-recording sunglasses.Miller was working at Microsoft Corp. in late 2021 when she purchased a pair of Ray-Ban Stories, the first version of Meta’s souped-up sunglasses. But her excitement about the novel idea was quickly overshadowed by all the ways she thought they could be improved. So she dashed off a detailed — and unsolicited — list of suggested fixes to Alex Himel, Meta’s head of wearables.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad AOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\n“She wrote me an email that articulated what she thought was good about the device and what was promising, and then a longer list of things that she would improve,” Himel said, recalling that he agreed with most of the ideas.\n\nMiller’s email and her meticulous attention to detail landed her a job the following year at Meta, where she now oversees products for the entire wearables division, including a full line of the Ray-Ban glasses she previously critiqued. Once more of a novelty, the glasses are becoming increasingly important within Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars researching and building futuristic wearable technology, a bet on his belief that augmented reality glasses, which can overlay images and text on a user’s view of the physical world, will be the next major computing platform. One day, the company has suggested, they may even replace the phone in your pocket.\n\nThat vision will be on display Sept. 25 at Meta’s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California, where the company is expected to unveil an AR glasses prototype that also falls under Miller’s authority, codenamed Orion. While an AR version is still years away from mainstream availability, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are available now, and have been a “bigger hit sooner than we expected,” Zuckerberg told investors last month.While the current edition of Meta-powered Ray-Bans don’t yet have augmented reality capabilities, they do have video cameras, speakers and an AI assistant you can talk to. They’re also significantly more stylish than the Orion glasses are expected to be, and cost $299. That’s been enough to attract more than half a million consumers, according to market research firm IDC, which estimates Meta has shipped upwards of 700,000 pairs of the latest Ray-Bans since their launch in 2023.Meta’s goal is to one day merge these two projects into one product: A fashionable pair of glasses coupled with advanced AR technology. The idea is to get people accustomed to the idea of smart glasses slowly, building up to a pair with full augmented reality capabilities. There’s a “laddering up to AR glasses that we’re certainly going after,” said Heidi Young, Meta’s vice president of engineering.\n\nFor now, the top of that ladder is many rungs away. After years of investment, Meta is still far from delivering a pair of glasses that are stylish enough to work for general consumers but powerful enough to offer AR features. Other companies have tried augmented reality glasses, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Snapchat parent Snap Inc., though neither has found a robust market for their products in part because the glasses look bulky or weird. Eight years after first taking a crack at the wearables market, Snap showed off its own AR glasses, called Spectacles, earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\n\nFor Zuckerberg, successfully blending the Ray-Ban styles with AR features would be the ultimate aim, since owning a widely used pair of AR glasses would mark a step toward decreasing Meta’s reliance on rivals like Apple Inc. and Google. The two companies dominate the smartphone market, which also means they serve as middlemen between Meta’s products and the consumers who use them. Zuckerberg has said that structure has hurt Meta’s business and can be “soul crushing.” If glasses are indeed the future, Zuckerberg wants to own the market.\n\nMiller will have a major role in determining whether Zuckerberg’s vision succeeds. A self-described “crazy cat lady,” she took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference a year ago in a pair of Hello Kitty jeans and a T-shirt featuring a picture of her own cat, Adobo. She delivered an impassioned speech to thousands of software developers about the potential for Meta’s smart glasses. “You no longer have to choose between capturing the moment or truly experiencing it,” she said. Even though the attendees had mostly flocked to Meta’s headquarters to hear more about the company’s latest Quest virtual reality headsets, Miller stole the show.\n\n“They were not there for glasses, and then she took the stage and I think really overpowered the event,” Himel said. “A large percentage of people who went to the event actually bought glasses on the spot and took them home.”\n\nSales savvy aside, Miller’s contributions to Meta’s wearables division are the result of spending almost two decades at Microsoft, where she worked on a collection of consumer products that included Xbox, Windows, Windows Phone and the Bing search engine. It was there that Miller first developed a reputation among colleagues for being “in the weeds” — displaying a knack for the kind of detailed analysis that caught Himel’s eye. “She would be in every single ship room and review we had for the program,” said Marleine Daoud, who worked with Miller on new features for Xbox’s rewards program. That level of involvement was rare for leaders at her level, Daoud said.\n\nMiller also learned the challenges of packing a lot of computing power into tiny devices, said Shiraz Cupala, a product leader for Microsoft Teams, who worked with Miller on bringing Xbox features to Windows Phone. “You have to take into account the constraints of the device to create an experience that really works well and is reliable,” Cupala said. “She has a very strong instinct about how to make those hard decisions.”\n\nThat skillset has been put to use as Miller worked on Meta’s smart glasses, which feel as thin as regular sunglasses but are enhanced by Meta’s virtual assistant, Meta AI, and can take photos, record videos, play music and respond to voice commands. She uses them all the time, sometimes for helpful things, like using the camera and voice assistant to translate a menu in a foreign language, or for mundane things like recording her cats playing around in the living room. Some days, Miller wears the glasses as much as 14 hours.\n\nWhile in Paris this summer to watch the Olympics, for example, Miller brought along three different pairs of Meta’s smart glasses, some of which had unreleased features and technology, to stress test them in the “wild,” according to Himel. When she returned from vacation, she once again handed her boss a list of changes and feedback.\n\n“When you wear a product that much, you do love it,” Young said. “But you also see all of the little flaws and warts all over the product and so you just become doggedly obsessed with fixing those things.” Young credits Miller with having an outsized influence on the product’s look and feel, including the cat-eye shape, which Meta worked on alongside Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica. She also said Miller has pushed hard to improve the camera and its functionality within the glasses to ensure high-quality photos. “If there was one person that put their fingerprint on this product, I would say it’s her,” Young said.\n\nMiller says part of what motivated her to join Meta was the company’s drive to dominate a new category of technology. “I want to work on something that will still be here and be relevant in 10 years,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year. “It was very attractive to me that Meta is very ambitious. Mark puts money where his mouth is.”\n\nMiller wasn’t the only critic of Meta’s first pair of smart glasses from 2021; only 10% of the people who bought them used them monthly, according to the Wall Street Journal. Snap fared even worse with its first effort at glasses several years ago, and the company ended up taking a $40 million writedown for unsold inventory.\n\nZuckerberg seems more optimistic this time. He said advancements in Meta’s AI voice assistant are part of why the current Meta-enabled Ray-Bans are more useful, spurring adoption. “Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them,” he said in July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia gets almost half its revenue from just 4 customers. Here's who they might be",
        "content": "When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers.\n\nWhile the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said.\n\n“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing.\n\nNvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one.\n\nHere’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips.\n\nAlphabet Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2017 Conference on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million.\n\n“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion.\n\n“Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said.\n\nAnd while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24.\n\nGoogle announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories.\n\nWith 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities.\n\nIn August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nAmazon Amazon fulfillment center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nMonths after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times.\n\nIn April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan.\n\nWhile Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nIn March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever.\n\nMeta Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April.\n\nMeta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B.\n\nMeta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4.\n\nMicrosoft Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella at CES 2024 on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps.\n\nThe AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.”\n\nMicrosoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said.\n\nTesla Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. - Photo: Christian Marquardt - Pool (Getty Images)\n\nTesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging.\n\n“There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.”\n\nIn September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app.\n\nTesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap.\n\nMusk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.”\n\nOpenAI OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during OpenAI DevDay on November 6, 2023 in San Francisco, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nWhen it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors.\n\nIn September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks.\n\nIn May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Highlights Potential Economic Gains from AI",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design​. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets – over 20% – to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company recently coordinated the penning of an open letter to the European Union, authored by senior executives at several tech firms, which warned the EU that it risked missing out on the full benefits of AI due to tech rules that invited inconsistent regulatory decision making. Per news publication The Wall Street Journal, nearly two dozen firms signed the letter, which noted that AI could boost productivity and expand the economy, but Europe may reap fewer rewards of this.\n\nDA Davidson recently initiated coverage of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The investment advisor called Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation. Per analysts at DA Davidson, aside from Alphabet, Meta was the least expensive mega cap, even before factoring for the option to sever Reality Labs losses, which would take the multiple down to 16-times, thus providing downside protection.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta's strong free cash flow fuels its massive share buyback program.\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms): My choice is Meta Platforms, thanks to its $50 billion share buyback program and fantastic free cash flow.\n\nWhy do I link the share buyback and free cash flow? Well, if share buyback programs were airplanes, free cash flow would be their fuel.Simply put, a buyback plan would crash and burn without ample free cash flow.That's because companies use free cash flow to fund their buyback plans.\n\nThankfully, Meta is awash in cash profits. Over the last 12 months, the company has reported $49 billion in free cash flow, or $18.83/share. Over the last five years, Meta has increased its free cash flow by 154%. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMeta has achieved this incredible cash flow thanks to its asset-light business model. The company's average operating margin over that five-year period is an outstanding 35% -- topping other internet giants like Alphabet (27%) and Netflix (20%).\n\nWhat's more, as the digital ad market continues to expand, Meta's revenue -- and subsequently its free cash flow -- should expand, too. Analysts expect Meta's revenue to rise to $165 billion in 2025, up roughly 14% from this year.\n\nIn turn, the company's cash pile should grow even larger. It stands at $58 billion, although the company also has about $38 billion in debt. Nevertheless, Meta has more than enough cash profits to cover its new dividend and share buyback program.\n\nThe dividend, introduced this year and first paid out in May, has cost the company about $2.5 billion this year. The total cost should rise to roughly $10 billion per year. That leaves Meta plenty of cash to keep buying back stock.\n\nShareholders have 60 billion reasons to like this share buyback\n\nWill Healy(Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has long stood out for its Windows OS and Azure cloud platform. As the world's second-largest publicly traded company, it is used to going big and also plans to do so with its cash reserves.\n\nTypically, its 10% dividend increase might constitute such a move by itself. However, that adds less than $2.2 billion to its dividend costs. What is likely more significant is it also approved a share repurchase program valued at up to $60 billion!\n\nWhile that sounds massive, investors should put that into perspective. For one, it's a multi-year plan and Microsoft could revoke the plan at any time. The company has not guaranteed that it will spend the entire amount on buying back shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the number of outstanding shares stands at just over 7.4 billion. Even if it spends the entire $60 billion allotment on share repurchases at today's share price, that will remove just under 138 million shares from the market, less than 1.9% of the shares currently available.\n\nStill, this likely tells investors how Microsoft will deploy much of its liquidity, which stands at a staggering $75.5 billion. With that cash, it can easily afford share buybacks, $24 billion in annual dividend expenses, and the costs of servicing its $45 billion in total debt.\n\nAnother factor that will help bankroll the repurchases is the approximate $74 billion Microsoft generated in free cash flow for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). Thanks to the popularity of Azure and its funding of privately held OpenAI, Microsoft has access to some of the latest technology in the AI field.\n\nAs more of its clients seek to leverage AI, Microsoft stock should find itself in a virtuous cycle. Not only will its free cash flow probably rise, but it will also help fund the share buybacks and, by extension, the price growth that will continue to draw more investors to Microsoft stock.\n\nA ramped-up buyback program could be a taste of what's to come.\n\nJustin Pope (Nvidia): AI's arrival on Wall Street last year has turned Nvidia into one of the world's largest companies. This business went from less than $30 billion in annual revenue to an estimated $125 billion in Nvidia's fiscal year ending this January. Companies are investing heavily to build the computing capacity to support AI applications, and the trend is poised to continue, with Nvidia getting set to roll out Blackwell, its next-generation AI chip line.\n\nNvidia is highly profitable, converting roughly half its revenue into free cash flow. That means the company could end its fiscal year generating over $60 billion in cash profits. Management hasn't wasted any time putting that cash to work; the company announced a $50 billion share repurchase program at the end of August with Q2 earnings. Share repurchases, or buybacks, lower the amount of outstanding shares, boosting earnings per share and other per-share financials. It's a way for a company to support its stock price while sharing its profits with investors.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is more than 15% off its high and trading at a forward P/E of 41 using analyst earnings estimates for this year. Analysts believe Nvidia could grow earnings by over 40% annually for the next three to five years, so Nvidia appears attractively valued for its expected growth.\n\nThat's an excellent situation for a company to consider repurchasing stock. Buybacks create more value for shareholders when the stock's valuation makes sense. The lower the price, the more shares the buybacks can afford, and the higher earnings (and the stock price) go. Nvidia's AI success gets all the hype, but don't underestimate the role buybacks could play in Nvidia's investment returns over the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Fed's preferred inflation gauge and second quarter GDP: What to know this week",
        "content": "The rate cut that everyone was waiting for finally arrived. Markets offered a resoundingly positive response to the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign. But the euphoria was only fleeting. Friday's trading brought fresh concerns over corporate earnings and economic growth.\n\nStocks, however, still posted overall wins for the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week up about 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 1.5%. While Friday brought down the S&P, the index notched an all-time high earlier in the week and the Dow closed with a record.\n\nThe biggest question for investors this upcoming week is whether a new batch of data supports Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assertion that the US economy remains strong.  A second quarter GDP reading due Thursday will help test that contention.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell was also careful not to declare a victory over inflation as pricing pressures continue to come down. Friday's scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will offer another progress report on that front.\n\nQuarterly earnings reports from Costco (COST), Micron (MU), and Accenture (ACN) are also on deck.\n\nWhat's next for the Fed?\n\nThe quiet period is over and so is the tightening. The public is set to receive fresh commentary from Fed officials in the days after the momentous shift away from a restrictive monetary policy. Perhaps the biggest question for policymakers is, where do we go from here?\n\nAt least eight central bank officials, including Powell, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr, and New York Fed chief John Williams, are scheduled to offer speeches or participate in conferences in the days ahead, likely giving color to the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Fed members see two more 25 basis point cuts this year, followed by four more in 2025.\n\nPowell has said the central bank was not playing catch-up in opting for a larger rate cut, addressing criticism that the Fed should have eased rates at their last policy huddle in July. He's also stated that cuts of 50 basis points shouldn't be thought of as the new norm. But a greater slowdown in the labor market could challenge both of his contentions.\n\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThe new risks and the old\n\nInflation was so high and the job market so tight that curbing price increases was the Fed's sole focus over the last two years. But now that inflation is cooling and the job market showing signs of slowing, the Fed has to advance its mandate on both fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday Powell noted the upside risks to inflation have diminished while the downside risks to employment have increased. \"We know it is time to recalibrate our policy,\" he said, confirming that the balance of risks is \"now even.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Friday's PCE reading to come in at 2.3% year over year, down from the prior month's 2.5% annual increase, according to Bloomberg data. Such a favorable metric would continue a downward climb and affirm the Fed's decision making. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut even as more eyes are on the labor market, the Fed still hasn't met its inflation goal of 2%. And as central bankers have reiterated, stepping off the brakes too early could allow heightened inflation to pick back up.\n\nAs Bank of America Global Research analysts put it in a note on Friday, \"With above-potential growth, a strong consumer, and a record-breaking stock market, such a bold start to an easing cycle is hard to justify if a recession isn't imminent.\"\n\n\"Unless the Fed is seeing something that we are missing, a more aggressive easing cycle could make reaching the 2% target harder considering uncertainty ahead, including the aftermath of US elections,\" they wrote.\n\nTech stock reset\n\nTech investors have been on the hunt for their next catalyst, and the Fed may have just handed it to them. After a mixed earnings season where Wall Street largely soured on massive AI spending and flashed impatience for less-than-perfect quarters, the rate-sensitive sector could revert back to growth mode.\n\nAll but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks posted gains last week, with Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) all outpacing the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA), the sole loser, shed more than 2% last week as it grapples with volatility after a stunning spring and summer rise. Still, some analysts see a more nuanced picture. As Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned, the upside of even the most high-flying tech stocks is limited as the ability to match their prior growth becomes more difficult.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Soar in 2025, According to This Metric",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have rocketed higher this year. But these companies are benefiting from powerful trends in data center spending and digital advertising that could send their share prices to new highs in 2025.\n\nThese stocks trade at relatively low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios compared to Wall Street's 2025 earnings estimates, which could set up another monster run for investors next year. Here's how these stocks can deliver.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia continues to report phenomenal growth, as data centers transition from traditional computing to accelerated computing systems to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, which sent the stock up 161% over the last year.\n\nThe stock's forward P/E is 28 based on next year's earnings estimate, which is too low, given Wall Street's estimate calling for 40% earnings growth next year and 36% over the next several years. The stock currently trades at a P/E of 53 on trailing-12-month earnings. If the stock is trading at the same trailing P/E and Nvidia stays on track to meet next year's earnings estimate, the share price could climb over $200.\n\nThe stock pulled back over the last month amid concerns about the delay of Nvidia's new Blackwell computing platform. But demand trends look very favorable. Management expects to begin generating revenue from Blackwell in the fourth quarter, and that will be additive to demand for its current-generation chip.\n\nImportantly, management pointed to a variety of workloads driving growth for its data center business. Customers are buying its hardware for generative AI model training and inferencing, in addition to development of cutting-edge AI models. Demand is coming from consumer internet services and thousands of start-ups building AI applications across healthcare, advertising, and education.\n\nNvidia stock was trading at a similar P/E in December before the stock doubled in 2024. The current valuation suggests it could repeat that performance again as it launches Blackwell.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nDigital advertising is making up a growing share of total ad spending, and this continues to fuel growth for Facebook owner Meta Platforms. The social media stock is up more than 80% over the last 12 months, but still trades at a very attractive valuation that can support more gains in 2025.\n\nMeta shares trade at a forward P/E of 22 on next year's earnings estimates. This is well below Meta's average P/E over the last 10 years of 38. The stock could climb as much as 50% if the stock's P/E closes some of that gap. Analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 17% over the long term, which justifies a higher P/E.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has a long runway of growth in digital advertising, and the company's investments in AI will help unlock that potential. In early 2023, Meta announced Llama, a large language model that can interpret a string of words to complete a text. It's already released Llama version 3.1, which is having an impact on its revenue growth.\n\nLlama is the technology behind Meta AI, a personal assistant that has improved the user experience on Meta's social media platforms. Meta AI is driving higher user engagement and upside in advertising revenue. Meta's revenue grew 22% year over year in Q2.\n\nGiven the growth opportunity, Meta plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Meta is a highly profitable business with $49 billion in free cash flow. It can afford to invest aggressively in AI and gain a technological edge. Given these advantages, the stock seems conservatively valued and deserving of a higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It will also aid a Chinese immersion program and “other strategic priorities,” he said.\n\nThe announcement cited Saverin’s wife, Elaine Saverin, as saying she hoped the donation would aid thousands of current and future students at SAS. She said the gift “is a significant and meaningful way for our family to demonstrate our commitment to the school.”\n\nBorn to a wealthy Brazilian family, 42-year-old Eduardo Saverin moved to Singapore in 2009 and renounced his US citizenship in 2011, ahead of Facebook’s initial public offering.

        "title": "Here's Why We Think Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Might Deserve Your Attention Today",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Quickly Is Meta Platforms Increasing Earnings Per Share?\n\nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Meta Platforms grew its EPS by 14% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Meta Platforms is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 12.9 percentage points to 41%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Meta Platforms.\n\nAre Meta Platforms Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$1.4t company like Meta Platforms. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$193b. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add Meta Platforms To Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Meta Platforms is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with Meta Platforms.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Sarah Silverman Lawyers Get Judge’s Harsh Rebuke in Meta AI Case",
        "content": "(Bloomberg Law) -- The legal team bringing a proposed class action accusing Meta Platforms Inc. of training its AI model on copyrighted books of authors including comedian Sarah Silverman is failing to adequately represent its clients, a San Francisco federal judge said at a Friday hearing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads AOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\n\n“You and your team have barely been litigating the case, that’s obvious,” Judge Vince Chhabria told the authors’ attorney Joseph Saveri of the Saveri Law Firm LLP.\n\n“I will not certify a class represented by this legal team,” Chhabria said at the virtual case management hearing. “There is no way that I would find adequacy of representation based on the representation that I’ve seen take place thus far.”\n\nThe judge said the attorneys representing Silverman and other authors including Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Andrew Sean Greer should bring in other law firms that have “the resources and the wherewithal” to litigate the case “properly.”\n\nSaveri and his co-counsel Matthew Butterick didn’t immediately return requests for comment about the hearing.\n\nChhabria’s admonishment came in response to the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ request to extend the deadline for factual discovery in the case by 97 days. The deadline had been set for the end of the month, and Chhabria said he would extended it by 14 days to account for a few remaining depositions.\n\nMeta’s Internal Documents\n\nThe authors first filed the class action against Meta in the US District Court for the Northern District of California last year, alleging the company took their copyrighted books without permission to train its open source AI model called LLaMA. Chhabria dismissed parts of suit, but the authors’ core claim of copyright infringement is proceeding.\n\nMeta will argue that its copying of the book is permitted by copyright law’s fair use exception, which allows unauthorized copying under certain circumstances.\n\nSaveri and other attorneys at his firm argued that they needed additional time to obtain internal documents from Meta to identify whether the company knew it was training its AI model on ebooks taken from pirated databases. They also argued that Meta has produced tens of thousands of technical documents that the plaintiffs’ experts must analyze.\n\nBut Chhabria said the discovery process had been dragging on for too long, based largely on failures by the plaintiffs’ attorneys to raise discovery disputes in a timely manner.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe judge said he was in a “bind” because on the one hand, the discovery problems are the fault of the plaintiffs. But on the other hand, the question of copyright law and AI training is an “important societal issue” and the court has a duty to the proposed class members, Chhabria said.\n\nCooley LLP, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, and Lex Lumina PLLC represents Meta.\n\nThe case is Kadrey v. Meta Platforms Inc., N.D. Cal., No. 3:23-cv-03417, 9/20/24.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Isaiah Poritz in San Francisco at iporitz@bloombergindustry.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stephanie Gleason at sgleason@bloombergindustry.com\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming Why Get An MBA?

        "title": "Facebook loses jurisdiction appeal in Kenyan court paving the way for moderators' case to proceed",
        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Facebook ’s parent company Meta on Friday lost its appeal in a Kenyan labor court that ruled the company could be sued in Kenya over the mass sacking of content moderators.\n\nThe court had earlier ruled that Kenyan courts had jurisdiction over the matter, but Meta challenged the ruling on appeal.\n\nThe case filed by some 185 content moderators from different African countries who were working for a Meta contractor, Sama, in Nairobi will now proceed in the labor court, their lawyer, Mercy Mutemi, said Friday. They are seeking $1.6 billion in compensation.\n\nFacebook is facing two lawsuits in Kenya, the first one filed by content moderator Daniel Motaung who alleges the company exploited him and his colleagues and damaged their mental health. The second case filed by 185 moderators challenges the termination of their employment contracts.\n\nFacebook and Sama have defended their employment practices.\n\nSome of the petitioners have told The Associated Press that their jobs required them to watch horrific content for eight hours a day that overwhelmed many of them while being paid 60,000 Kenyan shillings, or $414 a month. They accused Sama of doing little to ensure post-traumatic professional counseling was offered.\n\nThe Kenyan workers' case is supported by U.K.-based non-profit organization Foxglove whose director, Martha Dark, said Meta had played “legal tricks to delay the case” and expressed hope that justice would be served.\n\nJames Irungu, one of the 185 former Facebook content moderators bringing the case, said the ruling was “a significant victory.”\n\nAn out-of-court settlement agreed on in court collapsed in October 2023 after what the moderators’ lawyer termed as insincerity by Facebook.\n\nThe lawsuit is the first known court challenge of its kind against Facebook outside the United States. In 2020, Facebook agreed to pay $52 million to U.S. content moderators who filed a class action lawsuit after they were repeatedly exposed to beheadings, child and sexual abuse, animal cruelty, terrorism and other disturbing content.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Former Snap design engineer on new AR glasses: 'Obviously bad'",
        "content": "One of Snap’s (SNAP) own former employees thinks its augmented reality glasses are \"bad.\"\n\nSterling Crispin, an engineer who worked on designing the glasses in the past, slammed the product in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, this week.\n\n“I worked on these for about a year at Snap, and I have a million negative things to say about the experience and the device,” Crispin wrote of Snap’s AR Spectacles, “but I think the product speaks for itself and is obviously bad.”\n\nSnap did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment.\n\n“I don’t want to get into the specifics because I might inadvertently break an NDA and would probably hurt some people’s feelings who worked on it, but it’s really a disaster,” Crispin continued.\n\nCrispin was laid off from Snap in 2022, according to a LinkedIn post he shared at the time.\n\nSnap's newest AR Spectacles represent a bid to expand in a struggling market. Meta (META) has lost nearly $50 billion in the more than four years its Reality Labs division has spent developing its AR and VR products. Apple’s (AAPL) attempt to best the market with its uber-expensive Vision Pro headsets has disappointed consumers and investors alike. Not to mention the failures of Google Glass (GOOG) and Microsoft’s HoloLens (MSFT), among others. A participant at the Snap Partner Summit event tries out the new generation of Snapchat glasses, \"Spectacles.\" (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped Meta, Apple, and now Snap from trying. Meta and Ray Ban-parent EssilorLuxottica (ESLOY) recently expanded their partnership as they continue to work on creating AI-enabled Ray Ban smart glasses. Apple opened up Vision Pro sales abroad this summer, and the product was heavily highlighted during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June. And Google, Qualcomm (QCOM), and Samsung (005930.KS) are reportedly working on smart glasses too.\n\nSnap isn’t exactly new to the space. The company first launched its Spectacles in 2016 and added augmented reality features to the glasses in 2021, though those features were only available to about 200 creators. Its fifth-generation Spectacles debuted this week — this time as an AR product for a wider audience. The product will be available as part of the company’s developer kit for $99 a month.\n\n“Spectacles are the result of a decade of research and development to introduce hardware that breaks the bounds of screens and brings people together in the real world,” the company said in its announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe glasses have gotten mostly positive feedback. MIT Tech Review said the Spectacles “could finally deliver on the promises devices like Magic Leap, or HoloLens, or even Google Glass, made many years ago.” A CNET review said, “Snap is getting a foot in the door a little ahead of competitors.” The Verge said Snap is getting closer to creating “compelling AR.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThose glowing reviews are a good sign for the social platform as it looks to emerge from two years of financial hardship. Snap's stock has fallen nearly 37% over the past three months and its current $10 share price is far below highs in the $70 range in 2021. The company has yet to turn a profit since launching over a decade ago. Shares of Snap edged down 0.55% in Friday trading.\n\nSnap’s CEO has insisted that the company is turning things around. Indeed, the company’s loss shrunk 34% in the second quarter ended Aug. 1 compared to 2023. Its revenue grew 16% year over year to $1.2 billion but fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The platform’s new feature, “Simple Snapchat,” also launched this week as part of its efforts to attract more users and improve monetization.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +5.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 points to a change of +43.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.10 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.62 billion and $184.04 billion estimates indicate +19.8% and +13.9% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc (META): Best Forever Stock To Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\n\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\n\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\n\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\n\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\n\nSource: pexels\n\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\n\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\n\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\n\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors. We analyzed the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, focusing on high-quality US stocks with strong competitive advantages. We ranked the top 10 based on market cap and hedge fund holdings.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple in comments reigniting Tim Cook feud",
        "content": "If Mark Zuckerberg’s new laid-back look—complete with shaggy hair and chunky gold chain—is any indication, he’s much different from the straightlaced, crew-cutted Apple CEO Tim Cook. It’s no wonder, then, that the business philosophies of Zuckerberg’s Meta and Apple are as different as their two leaders. Zuckerberg has been eager to point out those differences and prod at a decades-long feud between the two tech giants and their chief executives.\n\nWhile Meta has prioritized acting fast and engaging users, such as through its open-sourcing of its Llama AI model, Zuckerberg said in the Acquired podcast episode released Tuesday, Apple prefers maintaining a closed ecosystem of polished, exclusive products.\n\n\"I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,\" he said. \"Clearly, their stuff has worked really well too. They take this approach that's like, 'We're going to take a long time, we're going to polish it, we're going to put it out,' and maybe for the stuff that they're doing that works, maybe that just fits with their culture.\"\n\nSince Tim Cook took the helm of the tech behemoth, Apple has prided itself on being the best, rather than the first. For the most part, it’s worked out for the company, demonstrated by its superlative of the world's largest smartphone provider. Apple has long tended to its walled garden of in-house products, which has resulted in a uniform line of apps and accessories bespoke to its tech—and a whopping antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice.\n\nBut Zuckerberg touted Meta’s own spaghetti-at-the-wall approach to its products, which he believes has elicited helpful critiques and enabled the company to grow in spite of its failures.\n\n\"You want to really have a culture that values shipping and getting things out and getting feedback more than needing always to get great positive accolades from people when you put stuff out,\" he said.\n\nThere’s certainly been no shortage of feedback toward Meta, exemplified by social media platform Thread’s meteoric rise to 100 million users, only for the number of accounts to atrophy weeks later. Its flagship Metaverse was a $46.5 billion failure, but that still hasn’t stopped Zuckerberg from adding $58 billion to his net worth this year.\n\nApple’s perfectionism has been at its own expense, Zuckerberg said, arguing the company prioritizes praise above constructive feedback from users.\n\n\"If you want to wait until you get praised all the time,” he said, “you're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s requests for comment.\n\nBillionaires butting heads\n\nZuckerberg’s commentary on Apple’s ways of doing business is not the first time he’s shared his thoughts on Cook’s company. For over a decade, he and Cook have differed on their philosophies not only on how to roll out products, but on the future of the internet more broadly.\n\nEarlier this month Meta and Apple’s feud reached a fever pitch after Meta urged greater government regulation of social media platforms, suggesting Apple and Google set age restrictions and requirements for parental consent. But Apple disagreed, arguing the onus for restrictions should be placed on the platform themselves.\n\nTensions between the two companies have been tightening since 2014, when Cook suggested Facebook made its money through the collection of personal data. The following year, Apple unveiled its motto, “Privacy is a fundamental human right.” Cook also lambasted Facebook as a hotbed for Russian misinformation used to mislead American voters ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nZuckerberg seems keen on fanning the flames of the tech rivalry today, calling Apple Meta’s “primary competitor” on Tuesday’s podcast. Cook historically has not agreed.\n\n\"Oh, I think that we compete in some things,\" Cook said in 2021. \"But no, if I may ask who our biggest competitors are, they would not be listed. We're not in the social networking business.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Social media platforms engaged in 'vast surveillance' and failed to protect young people, FTC finds",
        "content": "Major social media platforms and video streaming services that gather a \"staggering\" amount of data from its users have failed to protect young people and safeguard online privacy, the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday.\n\n\"These surveillance practices can endanger people’s privacy, threaten their freedoms, and expose them to a host of harms, from identify theft to stalking,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \"Several firms’ failure to adequately protect kids and teens online is especially troubling.\"\n\nThe agency, which is focused on protecting consumers and enforcing antitrust law, released a 129-page report that analyzes how some of the world's largest social media platforms including Instagram, TikTok and YouTube collect and use vast troves of data they gather from users. The findings highlight the mounting scrutiny online platforms face from regulators and lawmakers seeking to combat technology's potential harms as they become more deeply intertwined with people's daily lives.\n\nPoliticians and consumer advocates have long been critical of how companies such as Facebook compile information on users that is utilized to target ads at people based on their interests, location, gender and other information. There also has been alarm over how teens are grappling with the potential downsides of social media, including the sale of illegal drugs and comparing themselves with their peers.\n\nThe report stems from information the FTC ordered the largest social media and video streaming platforms to turn over in 2020. Those companies include Snap; Facebook, now Meta; Google-owned YouTube; Twitter, now X; ByteDance, which owns TikTok; Discord; Reddit; and Meta-owned WhatsApp.\n\nThe responses showed how companies collected information on unwitting consumers about household income, activities elsewhere on the Internet, their location and more. Tech platforms gather this data from ad tracking technology, data brokers and from users who engage with posts online, giving companies a glimpse into their interests. Some companies failed to delete data on people who had requested that they do so, the report said.\n\nEven though most social media platforms require teens to be at least 13 to create accounts, people can easily lie about their age and the platforms collect data from teens in the same way they do for adults, according to the report.\n\nIn attempts to fend off the ongoing criticism, social media companies rolled out features aimed at giving parents more control over their childrens' online experience. This week, Meta said it would make accounts for teens younger than 18 private by default, stop sending notifications to minors during certain times and provide more parental controls. Snap, which held its annual conference Tuesday, said it was partnering with Common Sense Media to develop a program so families know more about potential online harms.\n\nLawmakers, including in California, have been trying to address data privacy and youth safety concerns by passing new laws. But they've also faced legal hurdles because of a section of federal law that shields online platforms from being held legally liable for user-generated content.\n\nMeta and Snap declined to comment on the report. Meta is a member of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, which said in a blog post that the group was \"disappointed\" by the agency's characterization of the digital ad industry as one that engages in mass surveillance.\n\nDiscord, which allows users to communicate through text, video and voice calls, tried to distinguish itself from other social media platforms, noting that it doesn't encourage people to scroll endlessly by providing a running feed of comments.\n\n“The FTC report’s intent and focus on consumers is an important step. However, the report lumps very different models into one bucket and paints a broad brush, which might confuse consumers and portray some platforms, like Discord, inaccurately,\" Kate Sheerin, the head of U.S. and Canada public policy at Discord, said in an email.\n\nThe platform, which is popular among people who play games, also has shied away from running ads but started to run them this year.\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, said in a statement that it had the \"strictest privacy policies\" and outlined several measures it takes to protect kids, including not allowing personalized ads for users younger than 18.\n\nOther companies listed in the report didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe FTC noted that its findings have limitations because technology and a company’s practices can change. The responses the FTC received from the companies reflected their practices from 2019 to 2020, according to the report.\n\nThe agency included recommendations for companies and urged Congress to enact a law that would protect user privacy and grant consumer data rights. Companies should take steps to minimize potential risks, the FTC said, such as only collecting data that is necessary, being more transparent about their practices and having better default protections for teens and young people.\n\n\"As policymakers consider different approaches to protecting the public, focusing on the root causes of many harms — and not just the symptoms — is key,\" the report said.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia, AMD stocks lead tech rally after Fed rate cut",
        "content": "AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the tech stock rally Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s sizable, 50 basis point interest rate cut. Nvidia stock jumped more than 5% while its rival Advanced Micro Devices saw shares rise as much as 7% in afternoon trading.\n\nThe rising stock prices illustrate that investors are absorbing — and believing — Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s message that the US economy is “in good shape.” The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the stock market’s upward trajectory. The index was up 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.8% and the Dow (^DJI) climbed 1.3%.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven big tech stocks all posted gains. Meta (META) stock rose 4%; Apple (AAPL) jumped 3.7%. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) all bumped up nearly 2%. But the semiconductor subsector of the tech industry was a top gainer. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbed nearly 5%.\n\nNvidia’s climb is welcome news to investors who watched the stock’s rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. The chipmaker's shares fell after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings at the end of August, beating Wall Street’s expectations but lowering its projected gross margin for the full year.\n\nThe stock tumbled further upon news that the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia as the agency ramped up its antitrust investigation of the company. But it jumped again after CEO Jensen Huang successfully pitched investors on AI’s return on investment during a Goldman Sachs conference last week, and big names like Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have reportedly “begged” for more Nvidia AI chips.\n\nAnd while Nvidia’s stock price may be down about 12% from three months ago, it’s up a staggering 172% from this time last year. The semiconductor superpower has continued to benefit from the AI boom, which is proving to be more than just hype.\n\nAlthough Nvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, AMD is also a major beneficiary of the AI innovation wave. While the stock has faced ups and downs throughout the last year and has come down from record highs in March, shares are up nearly 55% from last year.\n\nAMD in late June posted second quarter profits up nearly 20% from the prior year. The company will report third quarter results in late October.\n\nThe semiconductor sector’s good day is a bright spot as it faces uncertainty with the US presidential election inching closer. Both presidential candidates’ tough-on-China stances would be bad news for American chip companies like Nvidia. The Biden administration has implemented tough export controls that ban Chinese companies from directly buying chips from Nvidia and AMD in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US introduced further restrictions regarding semiconductor and quantum computing exports earlier this month. In the meantime, Nvidia is working on a custom chip for Chinese customers that comply with current trade restrictions. Nvidia corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Courtesy NVIDIA/Handout via REUTERS (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nAnd despite an upbeat day, Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned that tech stocks' rise is slowing and that investors should take a barbell strategy.\n\n“What we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now,” he told Yahoo Finance Thursday. “It's beginning to decelerate.”\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to an unprecedented 42,000 points.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose by 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.5%, although the Russell 2000, representing small-cap stocks, outperformed with a surge of over 2%.\n\nThe market rally was primarily driven by the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of the Magnificent Seven are recording daily gains ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, solidly in positive territory.\n\nChart: S&P 500 Hits Record Highs\n\nImage: Benzinga Pro\n\nStrong Labor Market Eases Slowdown Fears, Analysts Boost Rate-Cut Wagers\n\nThursday’s economic data further boosted investor confidence. Weekly jobless claims came in well below expectations, suggesting a lower-than-expected trend of rising unemployment.\n\nContinuing jobless claims also dropped more than expected, hinting at a potential absorption of long-term unemployed individuals into the job market.\n\nThis data alleviated concerns about rising unemployment and provided a more optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nWall Street analysts quickly adjusted their expectations following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. There is now growing anticipation of additional rate cuts, diverging from the cautious tone expressed in the Fed’s September “dot plot” and Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks during the press conference.\n\nNotably, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius revised his forecast from expecting a 25-basis-point cut at every other meeting to predicting a rate cut at every meeting. He even left the door open for a back-to-back 50-basis-point reduction in November.\n\nThursday’s 5 Top-Performing S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAmong the S&P 500, the top five performers as of 10 a.m. ET were:\n\nName 1-day Return Darden Restaurants, Inc.

        "content": "Major central banks have started lowering interest rates, with more cuts on the cards before the year is out, and investment experts say it's important to position your portfolios accordingly.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut in more than four years on Wednesday, reducing rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%, from a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nThe Bank of England decided to keep its base rate on hold at 5% on Thursday in its September meeting but the central bank already cut rates in August and is expected to announce two reductions before the end of 2024.\n\nAnd the European Central Bank announced its second rate cut of the year last week, lowering the key deposit rate to 3.5% from 3.75%.\n\nOther central banks have also started to bring rates down, including the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, Sweden's Riksbank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\n\nRead more: Bank of England holds interest rates at 5%\n\nCentral bankers have been monitoring inflation figures closely to help guide these decisions, as they want to ensure price growth continues to slow to a target level, which for many is 2%.\n\nIn the UK, inflation held steady at 2.2% in the year to August, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Eurozone inflation also fell to 2.2% in August, while price growth in the US slowed to 2.5% last month.\n\nHowever, rate setters also want to make sure they don't wait so long to cut rates, as this slows economies down and tips them into a downturn. Then central banks might start to make faster and bigger interest rate cuts.\n\nAs this cycle of lowering rates is now well underway, Hal Cook, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says investors need to prepare their portfolios for these changes.\n\n\"Bonds are an obvious choice as their prices are very sensitive to changes in interest rates — as rates come down, their prices usually rise,\" he says. \"They have already rallied strongly over the last few months in anticipation of cuts, but likely still have further to go though, especially on a 12-month view.\"\n\nRead more: Pound hits two and a half-year high after Bank of England holds interest rate\n\nYields, or the income return, on bonds typically move inversely to prices. The yield on the 10-year government bond — known as a gilt — have ebbed lower recently and were trading at 3.85% on Thursday morning. The US 10-year government bond — which is called a Treasury — has also dipped over past few months and stood at 3.69% on Thursday.\n\nFund picks for rate cuts\n\nCook says that the managers of the Invesco Tactical Bond (0P0000MUWI.L) fund, Julien Eberhardt and Stuart Edwards, have recently been altering their investments to benefit from rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is best illustrated by their duration position which, at around seven years, is close to the highest it has been over the last 10 years in the fund,\" he says.\n\nDuration acts as a measure of how sensitive an investment is to interest rate changes and is measured in years, Cook says: \"The higher the duration value, the more sensitive the investment is to interest rate changes.\"\n\nOver one year, the fund has returned nearly 9%, beating its benchmark of the UK government bonds three-month generic bid yield of 5% and it has a yield of 3.4%.\n\nJonathan Moyes, head of investment research at the Wealth Club and manager of its portfolio service, highlights the Janus Henderson Strategic Bond (0P0001JUM5.L) fund as another option.\n\nRead more: What the Bank of England’s interest rate decision means for your mortgage\n\nHe says: \"The investment team, led by Jenna Barnard, are long term believers in 'secular stagnation' — the view that high levels of debt, ageing populations and tech driven disruption will drive developed economies to continue to grapple with the low growth, disinflationary environment that dominated markets before the pandemic and war in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"A return to secular stagnation would see a material move lower in interest rates,\" Moyes adds.\n\nHe says this views has informed the team's sizeable weighting to long-dated government bonds, given that these are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n\nMoyes says the Wealth Club team believe the fund would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lower-than-expected interest rate environment in its sector.\n\nOn a one-year basis the fund has generated a return of nearly 8%, below that of the 11% average delivered by its Investment Association (IA) strategic bond fund peer group. However, it has a distributing yield of 3.7%. Investors need to prepare their portfolios as rate cutting cycles get underway. (Imago, Imago)\n\nInfrastructure and property\n\nAnother type of investment that Moyes says is expected to perform well when interest rates fall is infrastructure.\n\nThe Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation (BIPC) invests in global assets, ranging from gas pipelines to a global container business and data centres.\n\nAs with all infrastructure assets, these investments have long lifespans, \"with cash flows that can stretch into the decades,\" says Moyes.\n\n\"Higher interest rates are bad news for long dated assets, the discount rates applied to those future cash flows are higher, and higher discount rates mean those cashflows achieve a lower valuation in today’s money.\"\n\n\"If interest rates fall, the reverse is true, you would expect longer term assets like infrastructure to do well.\"\n\nYear-to-date shares are up 18% and Moyes says this \"performance has been driven by the market’s view on the likely direction of interest rates and inflation\".\n\nHe says that the company should pay a dividend of $1.62 in 2024.\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\n\"If BIPC can achieve 6% to 9% dividend growth on top of a 3.9% yield, not guaranteed, it should be a welcome addition to a well-diversified portfolio,\" he adds.\n\nProperty is also a sector that is sensitive to interest rate changes.\n\nAlex Watts, fund analyst at Interactive Investor, says: “As well as potential capital appreciation, income is a key attribute of property investing. Even during periods of market stress, the income return of property has historically comprised a stable and significant portion of the total return.\"\n\nThe TR Property (TRY.L) investment trust is well-suited to access yields from real estate, Watts says.\n\nThe trust invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs), as well as shares and securities of property companies and property-related businesses. It also holds direct investments in UK property.\n\nSector exposure in the trust ranges from French and German offices, to student housing and supermarkets.\n\nWatts says that the trust's manager Marcus Phayre-Mudge, who has run the TR Property investment trust for over 19 years, \"looks for strong management teams overseeing quality assets and healthy balance sheets\".\n\nThe trust has a yield of 4.5% and Watts says it \"has an impressive record of growing the distributions year-on-year\".\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nFor more cautious investors, Hargreaves Lansdown's Cook suggests looking at multi-asset funds, which have a combination of different types of investments.\n\nOne example is the Baillie Gifford Sustainable Income (0P0001JSUH.L) fund which not only has exposure to infrastructure and property, but also to bonds, shares and cash.\n\n\"It’s managed by a number of experienced individuals at Baillie Gifford and the diversified nature of the fund means that even if rate cuts have differing impacts on different regions and asset classes, the fund has potential to benefit from them,\" says Cook.\n\nThe fund has returned nearly 10% on a one-year basis, slightly below its sector average of 13%, though it has a yield of nearly 4%.\n\nHigh-growth companies\n\nScottish Mortgage (SMT.L) investment trust, also run by Baillie Gifford, is another suggestion from the Wealth Club's Moyes.\n\n\"It’s struggled more recently as high interest rates mean many of these high growth companies have struggled to raise money to fuel their growth, leading many to tightening their belts — and their growth expectations — in the process,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Moyes says falling rates could provide a number of tailwinds.\n\n\"Lower rates should make it easier for these companies to raise money, fuelling future growth, while lower discount rates applied to those future growth prospects mean the present value of these companies should increase, [but that's] not guaranteed,\" he adds.\n\nHoldings include chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), as well as pharmaceuticals firm Moderna (MRNA) and Facebook-owner Meta (META).\n\nRead more: BP and L&G shares favourite among Fidelity investors as tech appetite fades\n\nOver one-year, the trust has produced a return of 21%, versus a return of nearly 20% from the FTSE All World index tracker.\n\nMeanwhile, Cook also says that there is value to be found in smaller companies \"who may find it more difficult to attract investment or borrow money in a higher rate environment [but] have tended to perform very strongly during rate cutting cycles in the past too\".\n\nHe says that this part of the UK market is trading on a \"significant discount\" to larger companies.\n\nCook highlights the FTF Martin Currie UK Mid Cap (0P00017MZL.L) as a good option in this space.\n\n\"Richard Bullas has managed the fund since 2013 and is a UK smaller companies’ expert that we hold in high regard,\" he says.\n\nStocks held in the fund include Pets at Home (PETS.L) and housebuilder Bellway (BWY.L).\n\nThe Franklin Templeton (FLXI.L) fund has generated a return of 17% over one year, which is slightly below its benchmark of the FTSE 250 (^FTMC) ex-investment trusts index, which is up nearly 20%, though it's ahead of its peer group average return of 17%.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg says Europe needs more consistent AI regulation—and even his privacy nemesis agrees",
        "content": "Leading technology executives, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Spotify's Daniel Ek, and Stripe's Patrick Collison, have written an open letter slamming Europe for its \"fragmented and inconsistent\" regulation of data privacy and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe block will “miss out” on the benefits of AI unless it regulates the sector more consistently, a wide-ranging group of CEOs and researchers wrote in the letter published Thursday.\n\nIt called for decisions from data privacy regulators across the EU to be faster, clearer, and more harmonized \"to enable European data to be used in AI training for the benefit of Europeans.”\n\nLeaders of European industrial titans like the German steel producer Thyssenkrupp and Italian tire-maker Pirelli also signed the letter.\n\nThe letter highlights the plight of companies that are developing open-source AI models, along with the data-processing restrictions that Meta says are stopping it from rolling out AI applications in the region. The letter echoes arguments that Zuckenberg and Ek made in an op-ed in the Economist last month.\n\nThe latest missive is likely to add to an on-going debate about Europe's sluggish economic growth and poor productivity that has grown to a fever pitch in the past few weeks following the publication of a major report into European competitiveness, written by Mario Draghi, former European Central Bank president. Draghi said the AI revolution gave Europe a chance to “redress its failings in innovation and productivity and to restore its manufacturing potential.”\n\nDraghi recommended that EU companies pool their data for open-source model training, but warned that limitations on data storage and processing stand in the way.\n\nStumbling blocks\n\nMeta’s difficulty in rolling out its AI assistant in Europe makes for a useful case study here.\n\nLike many companies these days, Meta has been exploiting its users’ publicly posted data (as opposed to private posts and messages) to train its AI models. It paused that practice in the EU and U.K. in June, following complaints privacy activists made to European data protection authorities.\n\nThose activists say that, under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Meta doesn’t have a secure legal basis for using Europeans’ data to train AI models. (The U.K. still uses an almost identical copy of the GDPR, even after Brexit.) They also claim that Meta is flouting the GDPR’s restrictions on \"purpose limitation\"—essentially, that it can’t repurpose Facebook and Instagram users’ data for AI training because that’s not what those users signed up for years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta last week resumed its U.K. AI rollout after assuring that country’s regulator that it would make it easier for users to opt out of their data being used as training fodder, but it still hasn’t received full U.K. approval for its training—the watchdog continues to watch. And in Europe, the pause seems set to continue indefinitely.\n\nMeta isn’t the only company that’s had to stop training its models on Europeans’ personal data, to comply with data-protection law. Elon Musk’s X has done the same and Microsoft's LinkedIn isn't even trying to train its models on European users' data, though those companies have decided to keep offering their AI in Europe nonetheless. Meta’s stance is that, if its models can’t be trained to understand Europe-specific idioms, knowledge and culture, the deployment isn’t worth it.\n\n\"They are absolutely right\"\n\nMeta says the inconsistency it is facing comes in two forms. First, the company says that different European data protection authorities have issued conflicting guidance about the use of personal data for AI training. On this, even Meta’s arch privacy nemesis agrees.\n\n“They are absolutely right that there are conflicting views from the DPAs,” said Max Schrems, the Austrian activist lawyer whose anti-Meta privacy crusade has given the company numerous nightmares over the last decade, and whose NGO issued the complaints that led to Meta’s European AI pause. “There are also guidelines by the DPAs that just structurally don’t understand how LLMs work...so the criticism is somewhat legitimate.”\n\nBut Meta also claims that it’s been picked on unfairly, as many other companies have also been using public internet data to train their models. “AI training is not unique to our services, and we’re more transparent than many of our industry counterparts,” Meta griped in June, when its rollout plans hit the buffers.\n\nFor some of the other signatories of Wednesday’s open letter, the issue seems to be more about perceived threats to Europe’s overall competitiveness than risks to their specific operations.\n\nFor example, one of the signing CEOs was Ericsson’s Börje Ekholm. The Swedish networking equipment manufacturer declined to give any comments to Fortune about problems that Ericsson itself is experiencing, due to the way AI is currently regulated.\n\nInstead, Ericsson pointed to a LinkedIn post by Ekholm, warning that “the U.S, China and India are sprinting ahead to embrace AI innovation while Europe lags behind in the dust, barely at crawling pace.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically “tread water,” gaining less than “one half of one percent.”\n\n“Most of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don’t want to be giving up on the growth,” Stovall said.\n\nStovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors’ radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings.

Davidson analysts said that while past tech innovation was driven by startups, the scale and capital required for AI and Spatial computing mean only megacap companies can dominate. While companies like Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are focused on closed platforms, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) leads the open-source side.\n\nThe firm praised Meta’s open-sourcing of AI tools like Llama, PyTorch, and FAISS, which they say has positioned the company as the leader in AI foundational model compute. Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) advancements in AI have already improved ad delivery and returns, making it easier to justify its AI investments and open-source strategy.\n\nOn Spatial computing, D.A. Davidson pointed to Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) heavy spending on Reality Labs as strengthening its position as the open-source counterpart to Apple’s closed ecosystem. They also commended CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership in navigating challenges.\n\nDavidson set a price target of $600 for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Won't Be Magnificent Buys in 5 Years",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" are a group of the world's most popular and promising growth stocks. Investing in these big-name tech stocks has been a great way to earn some significant returns in recent years. But things can change quickly in the tech world, and just because some stocks have done well in recent years doesn't mean that they will be solid stocks to hang on to in the long run.\n\nThree Magnificent Seven stocks that I don't think will look so magnificent in five years are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these particular stocks could struggle in the years ahead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet used to be a stock I was bullish about. The business looked dominant with a top video streaming website (YouTube) and a top search engine (Google).\n\nNowadays, I'm not as optimistic. As the ads get longer and longer on YouTube, the risk is that it might give users an incentive to switch to a streaming service such as Netflix instead, where there's a broad range of top content to choose from to help justify its price tag without annoying ads (depending on the subscription tier).\n\nBut the biggest risk for Alphabet undoubtedly comes in its search business. Regulators have already ruled that Google is a monopoly, and the consequences of that are still unknown, but they'll likely hurt its growth prospects. And with more artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots answering questions and reducing the need to go to Google, that's another headwind for its sales growth.\n\nThe stock might look cheap, trading at just 23 times its trailing earnings, and its revenue is still strong, growing by 14% year over year in the latest reported quarter, but investors shouldn't gloss over the long-term risks that Alphabet faces. There could be some daunting new challenges and competition that could stunt its growth and reduce its earnings power, which is why I would avoid the stock right now.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nAnother business that's doing well right now but could struggle in the future is Meta Platforms. Business has been booming for the company: Revenue jumped 22% year over year in the June quarter, totaling $39.1 billion. Meta management says its AI assistant will be \"the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe present looks solid, but the future might not be as promising. Like Alphabet, Meta faces challenges from regulators. Concerns relating to the company's social media platforms and their alleged adverse mental health effects on users might lead to changes in Meta's operations that could impact the bottom line. Last year, 42 state attorneys general sued Meta, claiming that Facebook and Instagram were too addictive for young kids. Elsewhere, greater restrictions are being called for on the data Meta collects and how it collects it. The social media platforms it operates could become less valuable for advertisers if the restrictions are added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen there is the continued massive spending by Meta on its Reality Labs segment and a metaverse that is showing little sign of ever providing the return on investment needed to justify it.\n\nAt 27 times earnings, Meta's stock doesn't look too expensive, but that could change if its growth slows down while the spending remains high. This is a tech stock I would avoid -- it could have a long way to fall in the next few years.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nThe most expensive stock on this list (based on valuation) is Tesla; investors are paying more than 60 times earnings to buy shares in it. But that isn't uncommon for the electric vehicle (EV) maker. Investors are accustomed to paying high multiples for the stock. This year, however, hasn't been a great one -- the stock is down around 7%.\n\nInvestors are concerned about the company's thinning margins due to a rise in competition and weak consumer demand. Neither one of those issues might improve anytime soon. A possible recession could hurt demand in the short term, and while that might be temporary, growing competition from Chinese EV makers could lead to Tesla needing to further reduce its prices, which would only exacerbate worries about its bottom line.\n\nTesla hopes that a successful launch of its robotaxi program could be a catalyst, but that could prove to be an underwhelming development for the company given the potential for regulatory issues and other obstacles.\n\nAs challenging as conditions are for Tesla right now, they could get worse for the stock over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s ‘Doing Better Than Ever’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Stock Picks You Can’t Ignore.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's top stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current divide between tech stocks and other sectors, highlighting their tendency to move in opposite directions. For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn’t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ—with all that tech in it—dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\n\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can’t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it’s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\n\"It’s because there’s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it’s not about the news, it’s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it’s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there’s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\n\nMarket Shake-Up: Clear Winners and Losers Amid Fed's Critical Rate Decision\n\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed’s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers—not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\n\nNow, you know me, I try to refrain from this parlor game of guessing the Fed's next move based on the strength of the economy. Last week, when *The Wall Street Journal* indicated the Fed may actually be leaning toward 50 basis points, we saw this great migration into cyclicals, especially anything related to housing. Of course, last week, there was just enough good news to propel the entire market, which is why it was the best week of the year.\n\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that’s how this market seems to be trading. It’s a big reason why I’m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn’t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It’s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\n\nJim Cramer's Definition of ABT: \"Anything But Tech\"\n\nJim Cramer noted that Monday’s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It’s crazy—healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that’s not what’s happening because it’s *ABT*. No, I’m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means “anything but tech,” and that’s what today’s market was about.\n\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what’s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market’s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\n\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has been struggling since its last earnings report, even though the company is performing well. He pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like other tech stocks, is currently contributing to market losses.\n\n\"And yes, Nvidia—that stock is still struggling since its last earnings report. Nvidia is doing better than ever, but it doesn’t matter. Nvidia, like the rest of tech, is just a share donor to the rest of the market.\"\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a strong investment choice due to its dominant position in the AI and GPU markets. In fiscal Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported an extraordinary 111% increase in revenue and a 137% rise in EPS compared to the previous year, far surpassing expectations.\n\nThis growth is driven by high demand for AI chips like the H100, key partnerships with major tech companies such as\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:META) and OpenAI, and continued investments in AI infrastructure. Analysts are optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future, predicting a 33% potential price increase thanks to its strong market position and growth potential.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\n\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Investment advisors at DA Davidson recently initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and listed it as a top pick within the mega-cap space. In an investor note, analysts at the advisory underlined that Meta had set itself up to be the open source leader for the next two major technology platforms — AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nThe analysts added that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has the pole position on the open source side of the AI world, while other tech giants like Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft were crowding into the closed garden side of AI platforms. The research firm said unlike previous tech innovations, the aforementioned future platforms could only be won by a megacap and praised the choice of Meta to open source AI compute elements.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The company recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. The cloud departments of these tech giants are leading these investments.\n\nWells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "Alphabet Vs. Meta Platforms: D.A. Davidson Selects the Superior ‘Magnificent 7’ Stock to Buy",
        "content": "It’s no secret that the tech sector has been the main driver of the current bull market. Tech is heavily overrepresented in the market indexes, making up more than one fourth of the S&P 500 and an even larger proportion of the NASDAQ 100 – and the mega-cap Magnificent 7 stocks have been leading the way.\n\nThese are the 800-pound gorillas of the tech sector, known for their innovative products and their heavy investments in cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence. With their deep pockets and deeper expertise, the Magnificent 7 tech stocks are among the leaders of the AI boom, and they’re positioning themselves to leverage the transformations that AI is sure to bring, transformations that could be far greater than any past technological breakthrough\n\nBut some of these giants might represent a better opportunity for investors than others. With this in mind, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is taking the measure of two Mag 7 shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) – and coming down to a recommendation on which one is the superior Mag 7 stock to buy right now. Here are the details.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFirst up, Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube and the dominant company in the fields of internet search and digital advertising. The company’s success has pushed it to just under a $2 trillion market cap, making it the fourth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street and one of just 6 trillion-dollar-plus companies.\n\nEven on the top tier, companies have to work to maintain their position. Alphabet has been proactive at this, leveraging its tech experience and expertise to develop new tools and applications for a rapidly approaching future. Prominent among Alphabet’s projects are multiple ventures into the world of AI.\n\nAlphabet is using AI to enhance the functionality of its internet search arm, combining generative AI with multimodal large language models to improve the capabilities of Google in both understanding requests and in delivering results. The company is also using AI tech in its online language translation services and in AI-powered text creation tools. The aim here is not solely to make Google or YouTube better, but also to develop a competitive edge against challengers such as Microsoft’s Bing search engine or against gen-AI content creators such as ChatGPT.\n\nAll of this is embodied in Alphabet’s Gemini model, the company’s strongest development of artificial intelligence. At its core, Gemini is a collection of large language models, and is designed to understand audio, images, text, video, and even code – all to give the most flexibility in the end use. Alphabet is working to integrate Gemini into all of its products, from Google to the Android operating system, and to put the model to use in chatbots, text generation, software coding – pretty much any form of content creation that an end-user can imagine. The key challenge for Alphabet will be maintaining market share as the search world shifts toward AI-powered tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is an issue noted by Davidson’s Gil Luria, who thinks there are reasons for caution here, mainly due to the company’s uphill road in integrating AI technology into its products but also in the legal repercussions of its current near-absolute dominance of online search. Luria writes, “While the company has maintained an almost monopolistic grip on the global Search market for years, many would argue that this dominance is under siege with the introduction of AI-enhanced search and chatbots. The rise of models like OpenAI’s GPT, which has been tightly integrated into Microsoft’s ecosystem, highlights this vulnerability inside of Google that despite its leadership in AI research and its massive data advantage, the company has struggled over the years to translate these assets into competitive commercial products at the same pace as its competitors.”\n\nOf more immediate importance, the analyst sees problems piling up on Alphabet’s horizon, and adds, “Shorter-term, Google will be navigating the transition from having 90% share in Search to something less than that as AI-enhanced Search becomes the new category. This transition will also become more difficult as it has to accommodate the DOJ charges that were specifically aimed at now allowing Google to sustain this monopoly during the transition.”\n\nFor Luria, this adds up to a Neutral (Hold) rating for the stock, while his $170 price target points toward a one-year upside potential upside of 7%. (To watch Luria’s track record, click here)\n\nAlphabet, like many of the major tech companies, has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street’s stock analysts – and there are 36 recent reviews on record for the stock. These include 27 to Buy and 9 to Hold, giving the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $202.94 represents a gain of 27.5% from current levels. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe second stock on our radar here is the world’s leading social media company, Meta Platforms. Through its main social media subsidiaries – Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp – Meta can reach more than one-third of the world’s population. At the end of June this year, the company reported that its Daily Active People (DAP) across the family of platforms was 3.27 billion, an extraordinary number, and one that was up 7% year-over-year.\n\nThat huge reach supports Meta’s core money-making business, its digital advertising sales. The company reported a 10% increase in the average price per ad, as well as a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the company’s family of platforms in 2Q24.\n\nIn raw numbers, that translated into quarterly revenues of $39.07 billion, up 22% from the prior year and $760 million better than had been forecast. The company’s Q2 bottom line came to $5.16 per share, beating the estimates by 40 cents per share.\n\nMeta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have been leading the social media wave for the better part of two decades now – but the company is not resting on its laurels. Meta is also positioning itself as a leader in artificial intelligence technology. The company already uses AI to fine-tune and narrowly target its ad impressions, and also uses AI tech in translation algorithms to make the platforms accessible across languages. But in addition, Meta is also moving into generative AI and working to expand the audience for AI generally.\n\nThe company has developed an open-source AI model, Llama, and is already on Llama 3. The platform aims to make AI more flexible and more accessible; its open-source code allows users to tweak the platform to meet their own unique needs, as well as to publish improvements that everyone can use.\n\nMeta has also released the Meta AI, an AI assistant/chatbot, across all of its social media platforms, as a direct challenge to the gen AI leader, ChatGPT. Meta AI has seen successes, and at the end of August, the company reported that the AI chatbot had already reached 400 million monthly active users and 40 million daily active users.\n\nMeta’s AI work is taking shape in the company’s Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute technology platforms. The first of these integrates the infrastructure, models, and frameworks that the company will need to put together AI apps at the scale needed to serve an audience of billions, while the second refers to the AR, VR, and immersive environments – what the company calls its ‘metaverse’ – that will let users interact seamlessly with the AI. Llama and Meta AI are the current applications available – but Foundation and Spatial Compute are where the rubber meets the road, and Meta plans to follow that road to the next generation of AI tech.\n\nAll of this makes Meta Platforms, in analyst Luria’s view, the superior Mag 7 stock for investors to buy right now. Luria says of this company, “We see META as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation… Meta’s strategic positioning in AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute signals a forward-looking bet on the next wave of technological transformation, where scale, capital intensity, and platform control will define market leadership.”\n\nGetting to the details, the analyst adds, “In AI Foundation Compute, Meta’s scale and access to massive datasets, high-performance infrastructure, and specialized developer talent offer a distinct advantage while similarly, in Spatial Compute, Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investments in Reality Labs and hardware platforms like Quest and Meta Ray-Bans give it the resources and ecosystem to shape this next computing paradigm, just as Apple and Google shaped mobile computing in the past decade.”\n\nBased on this, Luria rates META stock as a Buy, and his $600 price target suggests that he sees a gain of 12% coming on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, the Street is also bullish on Meta. The stock has picked up 45 analyst recommendations lately, which include 41 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $584.82 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 9% premium.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by concealing how changes to Apple's privacy settings would make Facebook and Instagram less desirable for advertisers.\n\nIn a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also rejected claims that Meta concealed former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's use of company resources on personal matters, including her wedding and her best-selling book \"Lean In.\"\n\nThe Oakland, California-based judge also turned aside claims that Meta knew its transition to Reels, which copied TikTok's short-form video format, would hurt revenue because it offered fewer ads per hour than older formats.\n\nShareholders led by four Israeli insurers and pension funds challenged 17 allegedly false and misleading statements that Meta made in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThey said Meta's stock price fell 53% in less than a year as the truth came out, wiping out well over $500 billion of the Menlo Park, California-based company's market value.\n\nBut in her 34-page decision, Rogers said Meta's eventual admission that Apple's iOS privacy changes could pose a $10 billion \"headwind\" in 2022 did not demonstrate that its earlier disclosures were false.\n\nShe also said the claims about Sandberg came \"entirely from press reports\" and were unproven, and found no proof that the transition to Reels hurt Meta's financial performance.\n\n\"The court determines plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged violations of federal securities law,\" Rogers wrote.\n\nShe dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.\n\nOther defendants included Sandberg, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li and her predecessor David Wehner.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Meta had no immediate comment.\n\nThe case, which has a different named plaintiff, is Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v Meta Platforms Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01470.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by concealing how changes to Apple's privacy settings would make Facebook and Instagram less desirable for advertisers.\n\nIn a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also rejected claims that Meta concealed former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's use of company resources on personal matters, including her wedding and her best-selling book \"Lean In.\"\n\nThe Oakland, California-based judge also turned aside claims that Meta knew its transition to Reels, which copied TikTok's short-form video format, would hurt revenue because it offered fewer ads per hour than older formats.\n\nShareholders led by four Israeli insurers and pension funds challenged 17 allegedly false and misleading statements that Meta made in 2021 and 2022.\n\nThey said Meta's stock price fell 53% in less than a year as the truth came out, wiping out well over $500 billion of the Menlo Park, California-based company's market value.\n\nBut in her 34-page decision, Rogers said Meta's eventual admission that Apple's iOS privacy changes could pose a $10 billion \"headwind\" in 2022 did not demonstrate that its earlier disclosures were false.\n\nShe also said the claims about Sandberg came \"entirely from press reports\" and were unproven, and found no proof that the transition to Reels hurt Meta's financial performance.\n\n\"The court determines plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged violations of federal securities law,\" Rogers wrote.\n\nShe dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.\n\nOther defendants included Sandberg, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li and her predecessor David Wehner.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Meta had no immediate comment.\n\nThe case, which has a different named plaintiff, is Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v Meta Platforms Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01470.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): A Bear Case Theory",
        "content": "We came across a bearish thesis on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) on Kroker Equity Research’s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on META. META Technologies, Inc. share was trading at $524.62 as of Sept 13th.\n\nMeta App 3D sign\n\nMeta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook, remains a dominant player in the technology sector, focusing on social media and virtual reality. The company's key platforms include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which are used by over 3.27 billion people worldwide. With its 2021 rebranding, Meta highlighted its ambition to lead the development of the \"metaverse,\" a series of virtual worlds facilitated by its Meta Quest hardware. This virtual reality push aligns with Meta’s strategy to innovate beyond social media, but remains speculative and uncertain in terms of future returns.\n\nThe bulk of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, driven by its unparalleled user data, enabling highly targeted ads. This advertising dominance supports Meta's core business, with substantial profitability despite its ambitious investments in unprofitable ventures like the metaverse and evolving AI projects. Over the past five years, Meta's financial performance has been remarkable, with a 19.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue and a 27% CAGR in earnings per share (EPS). The company is also debt-free and continues to generate strong free cash flow, balancing growth with large-scale share buybacks and dividends. Since 2019, Meta has repurchased $141 billion in shares, reducing its outstanding shares by 11%. This strong capital return strategy, combined with its first dividend payment in Q1 2024, makes Meta attractive to both income-focused and growth investors.\n\nHowever, Meta's stock price has surged over 300% since late 2022, raising concerns about its current valuation. Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, Meta's fair value per share is estimated at $407, significantly below its latest stock price of $524. Even under optimistic growth scenarios, the stock appears overvalued. Meta's forward P/E and EV/EBIT ratios, which stand at 23.21x and 19.39x respectively, further support the notion that the stock is trading at elevated levels.\n\nIn conclusion, while Meta remains a high-quality company with substantial cash flow and leading social media platforms, its stock is currently overvalued. The company’s heavy investments in the metaverse and AI are yet to demonstrate meaningful returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA Platforms, Inc. is on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 219 hedge fund portfolios held META at the end of the second quarter which was 246 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – September 18, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, The Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW and IDT Corp. IDT.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Meta, Texas Instruments and Schwab\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and The Charles Schwab Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock IDT Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +15.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.\r\n\r\nIt witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Texas Instruments have gained +19.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +94.4%. The company is benefiting from solid data center demand which is boosting its prospects in the enterprise systems market. Improving conditions in the personal electronics and communication equipment markets are a plus.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments’ growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages are tailwinds. Its deepening focus on manufacturing, advanced technology infusion, product portfolio expansion and consistent returns to shareholders, is another positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, widespread weakness in the industrial, and automotive markets is major concern. Sluggishness in its Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments is a negative. Increasing manufacturing costs are hurting its profitability. Overall weak demand environment and growing U.S.-China tensions are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here >>>)\r\n\r\nCharles Schwab’s have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the year-to-date period (-6.3% vs. +15.7%). As the company deals with low-yielding assets on its balance sheet, it plans to shrink itself to sustain profits and rely more on off-balance sheet arrangements to house deposits. This will likely put pressure on top-line expansion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst project total revenues to increase just 1.7% in 2024. Also, elevated expenses are likely to hamper profitability. Though we estimate the total expense to decline in 2024, it will increase in 2025. Yet, higher rates will likely aid net interest margin (NIM) while rising funding costs and low-yielding assets will weigh on it. We project NIM to be 2.13% in 2024.\r\n\r\nAlso, strategic acquisitions have increased the company’s client assets. We estimate total client assets to see a CAGR of 6.9% by 2026. Also, sustainable capital distributions are encouraging.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Charles Schwab here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of IDT have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. +8.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $ 965.16 million has high-growth, high-margin businesses which enhanced overall results, boosting consolidated gross margin by 310 basis points in third-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nNRS, with over 30,000 active terminals and a 65.9% year-over-year increase in merchant services revenues, leads growth, indicating robust expansion and profitability. Positive adjusted EBITDA across segments underscores operational efficiency. IDT's consistent gross profit rise, cost management and technological advancements drive sustained growth.\r\n\r\nYet, IDT faces risks from economic downturns, integration challenges, cybersecurity threats and international expansion. Declining traditional telecom revenues and rising operating expenses pose challenges. Compliance with fintech regulations adds to cost pressures, and competitive markets require continuous innovation to maintain market share.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on IDT here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta agreed to buy up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits from Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual's forestry arm through 2038, the companies said on Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThey did not disclose the value of the deal. The average price for forestry carbon offsets last week was $4.22 per credit, according to data provider Allied Offsets. That could value the deal at up to $16 million based on that pricing.\n\nCarbon offsets allow companies to offset greenhouse gas emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere to meet corporate climate goals. Each credit represents a reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nUnder the long-term contract signed by Meta and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (TIG), the owner of Facebook and Instagram agreed to buy 1.3 million carbon credits, with options to purchase an additional 2.6 million credits.\n\nMeta said the deal is its largest carbon removal transaction from a single project and is part of its commitment to reach net zero emissions across its value chain in 2030.\n\nThe credits were generated by BTG Pactual TIG's forest restoration projects in Latin America, where it has planted more than 7 million seedlings, according to the statement.\n\nIn June, TIG announced the sale of 8 million carbon credits to Microsoft in the largest-ever transaction of such credits worldwide.\n\nThe deals from Microsoft and Meta come even though demand for offsets broadly stalled last year.\n\nCompanies including food giant Nestle and fashion house Gucci have reduced their buying of credits amid widespread doubts that they served to reduce emissions.\n\n(Reporting by Andre Romani; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Worst AdTech Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "In this artice, we will look at the 8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now. Let's look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) stands against other worst adtech stocks.\n\nOverview of the AdTech Industry\n\nThe adtech industry includes an array of products and companies, including supply-side platforms (SSPs), demand-side platforms (DSPs), data management platforms (DMPs), ad exchanges, and more. According to data by Allied Market Research, the global adtech market stood at $748.2 billion in 2021, and is anticipated to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This translates to a compound annual growth rate of 14.7% between 2022 and 2031. Experts believe that the industry is well-poised for growth, with the global supply-side platform segment (SS) reaching a market size of $117.32 billion by 2033. Technological advancements, supportive government policies, and higher consumer demand are all factors expected to drive this growth.\n\nIn addition, changing trends such as the exponentially growing use of advanced technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning, growing Internet and digital penetration, growth of social media platforms and better prospects for the gaming industry, are all responsible for this growth. In-app advertising, interactive ads, and higher use of connected TV (CTV) have become the dominant trends in the AdTech industry, driving growth and change.\n\nTrends in programmatic advertising are also expected to improve, allowing the demand-side platform software market size to reach $120.1 billion by 2033. The demand for improved targeting and measurement capabilities for online ads is also an important factor to consider in this growth. While the AdTech industry seems promising on its own, the increasing use of artificial intelligence across all platforms is making it even more appealing.\n\nRecent Happenings in the AdTech Sector\n\nDespite its positive trends, the AdTech industry in the US is experiencing certain headwinds, the most prominent being Google’s highly profitable AdTech business going to trial. The Department of Justice and a coalition of states filed a lawsuit against the company in 2023, claiming that the company is illegally dominating the digital ad marketplace, leveraging its market power to suppress competition and innovation. A trial began this month, and the Department of Justice rested its case against its parent company for operating a monopoly in the AdTech market. The tech giant earned more than $200 billion through the placing and selling of ads in 2023, arguing that the reason behind this success is the “effectiveness” of its services. Prosecutors, however, claim that the company has used its dominance to shun rivals.\n\nIn addition, smaller AdTech firms are raising concerns over Google’s cookies alternative, Privacy Sandbox. While its ad business is under global scrutiny, the company is making adapting to Privacy Sandbox a critical necessity. However, regulators in the US and UK are of the opinion that the Privacy Sandbox would give Google the lion’s share of control over the digital advertising market, which might negatively affect competition.\n\nPotential technology development delays seem to be negatively affecting smaller AdTech firms, changing the course of the industry. While conclusive results aren’t out, such changes are highly likely to alter AdTech industry trends.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the 8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now, we used the Finviz screener, ETFs, and rankings to first identify 15 AdTech stocks. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the 8 stocks that have high short interest but also a high number of hedge fund investors. Finally, these stocks were ranked in ascending order of their short interest. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock as a secondary metric.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now\n\n8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nShort Interest: 1.31%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) ranks seventh on our list of the worst adtech stocks to buy now, and is one of the leaders in the domain. The company builds technology that allows people to connect, find communities, share, and grow their businesses. Its products help people do all of this by connecting through personal computers, mobile devices, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. Advertisers also use the company’s apps to expand their customer base and connect with customers\n\nMeta  (NASDAQ:META) operates through two primary segments: Reality Labs (RL) and the Family of Apps (FoA). The RL segment includes mixed, augmented, and virtual reality-associated consumer software, hardware, and content. In contrast, the FoA segment includes globally famous apps: Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads.\n\nAccording to the company’s estimations, more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) apps daily. This growth is especially strong in the US, where WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly active users. Year-over-year growth across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads is also strong, both in the US and across the globe. Threads is also on the path to hit 200 million monthly active users, thereby establishing itself as another major social app. These trends are primarily driven by the company’s shift in focus towards users aged between 18 and 29.\n\nJumping on the AI bandwagon, Meta (NASDAQ:META) has plans to significantly modify its services for advertisers by employing artificial intelligence in the future. Advertisers who previously came to the company with a particular pre-selected target age group, interest, or geography would no longer need to do so, as Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) AI-enabled ad systems would soon be better equipped to predict target segments. In the future, Meta (NASDAQ:META) expects to hand over the task of generating creatives for advertisements to AI as well, leaving advertisers to only contact the company with a budget and a vision.\n\nOn September 10, Meta (NASDAQ:META) was initiated with a Buy at DA Davidson. Its median price target of $524.6 implies an upside of 9.60%. 219 hedge funds hold stakes in the stock, with Citadel Investment Group holding the highest stake, worth $6.26 billion.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising, which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North American and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than-expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts’ estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.”\n\nOverall, META ranks seventh among the worst adtech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of adtech companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen\n\nHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's president and ruling Communist Party chief To Lam is set to meet representatives from several U.S. corporations, including Google and Meta, during a visit to the United States next week, two people briefed about the plans told Reuters.\n\nMeta's Facebook has in the 100-million-people country one of its largest user bases worldwide, and Google makes its smartphones there through suppliers and plans a large data centre, according to a Reuters report last month.\n\nIn his first trip to the United States since he was named in early August as head of the party, the country's most powerful job, Lam is scheduled to meet representatives of Google and Meta, the two people said, with one noting each of the companies would have a separate meeting with him. Neither said what will be discussed.\n\nAnother two people familiar with the plans said Lam will also attend on Sept. 23 a business forum with other U.S. business representatives.\n\nAll the four sources declined to be identified because the information was not public.\n\nThe US-ASEAN Business Council (USABC), which is one of the organisers of the Sept. 23 event, declined to share a list of participants.\n\nGoogle and Facebook did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nIn two large U.S. business missions the USABC lobbying group organised in Vietnam over the last 18 months, it brought in dozens of top U.S. corporations including defence firms, energy and tech companies.\n\nAmong firms who attended both recent missions to Vietnam, are power company AES, aviation giant Boeing, payment company Mastercard and Amazon, including its cloud computing subsidiary Amazon Web Services, according to lists of participants seen by Reuters.\n\nU.S. companies see Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and a market for their products. Apple's suppliers complete many of the company's products there, Intel has a large chip assembling factory, and defence firms have been long in talks to sell security equipment to Hanoi.\n\nBIDEN MEETING?\n\nLam's trip to the United States has not been formally announced, but officials said he would travel there on Saturday to speak at the United Nations General Assembly where global leaders meet for their annual get-together on Sept 22-23. He will fly to Cuba later in the week in the final leg of his trip.\n\nColumbia University has announced an event with Lam on Sept. 23 in New York.\n\nThe U.S. and Vietnam boosted their diplomatic ties last year as Washington sees the Southeast Asian nation as a strategic partner to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The U.S. is also seeking closer ties with Hanoi on sensitive industries, including undersea cables.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether Lam will meet U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House declined to comment about Lam, but said Biden planned to meet several foreign leaders at the United Nations.\n\nVietnam's foreign ministry and the president office were not immediately available for comments.\n\nLam met Chinese President Xi Jinping last month in his first trip abroad after his appointment as party chief.\n\nHe also plans a state visit to France in early October, an official told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen in Hanoi; additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom signs AI bills aimed at fighting election deepfakes like those spread by Elon Musk",
        "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom is signing into law three bills that target the misuse of video, audio, and images created by artificial intelligence in a sweeping effort to crack down on election deepfakes.\n\nNewsom had vowed to pass the legislation after billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk recirculated a deepfake video on his platform, X, in July featuring altered footage of Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe governor signed the bills during a fireside chat with Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff at the annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.\n\nAssembly Bill 2355 will require political advertisements to disclose whether they used generative AI to create or alter materials appearing in the ad. AB 2655 will hold large online platforms, such as Meta (META), liable for failing to remove or label deceptive election content within 72 hours of receiving a report by a user.\n\nAnd AB 2839 prohibits individuals from creating or publishing deceptive content about candidates and election workers, made with AI, in the 120 before and 60 days after an election. The measure also allows a judge to order the content to be removed and issue a fine. The measure contains an urgency clause - taking effect immediately.\n\nThe fake Harris audio shared by Musk reached nearly 140 million views over the summer. In the deepfake, Harris's voice is altered to say, “I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility,” adding that she was chosen “because I am the ultimate diversity hire” as “both a woman and a person of color.”\n\nThe video featured edited clips from past appearances by the vice president, but used an AI-generated voice. The YouTuber who originally posted the video disclosed that it was a parody. But Musk did not label the content as misleading, instead writing, \"This is amazing.\" The post was an apparent violation of X's rules.\n\nAt the time, Newsom clapped back at Musk, posting on X, \"Manipulating a voice in an 'ad' like this one should be illegal. I'll be signing a bill in a matter of weeks to make sure it is.\"\n\nCalifornia has taken the lead on regulating AI by introducing a wave of legislation this year. Despite fears of overregulating the emerging technology, analysts view the new laws as a move in the right direction.\n\n\"I think it'll be a positive and will also make people more comfortable advertising on those platforms,\" Harvest Portfolio Management chief investment officer Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Over the last several years, all of the protections have come from the European Union. We live under these 1996 regulations and haven't changed them ever since then. We essentially play second fiddle to the EU on this stuff — we probably should be the leader.\"\n\nNewsom also signed two SAG-AFTRA-related bills — AB 2602 and AB 1836 — aimed at protecting performers from unauthorized AI use. Last year, members of SAG-AFTRA went on strike against major studios and streamers. The performers claimed victory when their new contract offered compensation for the use of their \"digital doubles.\"\n\nPerhaps the most controversial AI bill still sitting on Newsom's desk: SB 1047. The artificial intelligence measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Scott Wiener, would require large-model AI developers to undergo safety testing before deploying the technology.\n\nSB 1047 has deeply divided the tech and political communities — many of whom argue it'll stifle innovation. Supporters say it'll force tech companies, including OpenAI, Meta, and Google (GOOG), to be aggressive in making sure new AI features are safe.\n\nWhile Newsom hasn't indicated whether he plans to sign or veto that bill, insiders say he may side with longtime ally former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who criticized it.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "content": "Tuesday, September 17, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) and The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), as well as a micro-cap stock IDT Corp. (IDT). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +15.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.\r\n\r\nIt witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Texas Instruments have gained +19.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of +94.4%. The company is benefiting from solid data center demand which is boosting its prospects in the enterprise systems market. Improving conditions in the personal electronics and communication equipment markets are a plus.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments’ growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages are tailwinds. Its deepening focus on manufacturing, advanced technology infusion, product portfolio expansion and consistent returns to shareholders, is another positive.\r\n\r\nHowever, widespread weakness in the industrial, and automotive markets is major concern. Sluggishness in its Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments is a negative. Increasing manufacturing costs are hurting its profitability. Overall weak demand environment and growing U.S.-China tensions are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here >>>)\r\n\r\nCharles Schwab’s have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the year-to-date period (-6.3% vs. +15.7%). As the company deals with low-yielding assets on its balance sheet, it plans to shrink itself to sustain profits and rely more on off-balance sheet arrangements to house deposits. This will likely put pressure on top-line expansion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst project total revenues to increase just 1.7% in 2024. Also, elevated expenses are likely to hamper profitability. Though we estimate the total expense to decline in 2024, it will increase in 2025. Yet, higher rates will likely aid net interest margin (NIM) while rising funding costs and low-yielding assets will weigh on it. We project NIM to be 2.13% in 2024.\r\n\r\nAlso, strategic acquisitions have increased the company’s client assets. We estimate total client assets to see a CAGR of 6.9% by 2026. Also, sustainable capital distributions are encouraging.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Charles Schwab here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of IDT have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. +8.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $ 965.16 million has high-growth, high-margin businesses which enhanced overall results, boosting consolidated gross margin by 310 basis points in third-quarter fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nNRS, with over 30,000 active terminals and a 65.9% year-over-year increase in merchant services revenues, leads growth, indicating robust expansion and profitability. Positive adjusted EBITDA across segments underscores operational efficiency. IDT's consistent gross profit rise, cost management and technological advancements drive sustained growth.\r\n\r\nYet, IDT faces risks from economic downturns, integration challenges, cybersecurity threats and international expansion. Declining traditional telecom revenues and rising operating expenses pose challenges. Compliance with fintech regulations adds to cost pressures, and competitive markets require continuous innovation to maintain market share.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on IDT here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include AT&T Inc. (T), Sony Group Corp. (SONY) and The Sherwin-Williams Co.

        "title": "Instagram releases teen accounts with built-in privacy, parental controls",
        "content": "Instagram on Tuesday announced the launch of new privacy and parental controls for teenagers on the platform to address rising concerns about the negative impacts of social media and give parents more control over their children's online experience.\n\nInstagram and Facebook parent Meta said the new Teen Accounts would automatically set to private with the need to approve new followers, and include new restrictions on messaging, sensitive content and interactions with users. It will also include new time limit reminders and a sleep mode feature.\n\nAntigone Davis, Meta's head of global safety, spoke with FOX Business Network's Madison Alworth in an exclusive interview about the new Teen Accounts and related safety features.\n\n\"It's really a game changer for parents,\" Davis said in the interview. \"And with this launch, tens of millions of teens will have an entirely new experience on the platform. What we'll be doing is putting them into automatic protections if they're under the age of 18 and if they're under the age of 16, a parent will have to give them permission in order to change those settings.\"\n\nMETA TO REMOVE MORE POSTS TARGETING 'ZIONISTS' AFTER UPDATING HATE SPEECH POLICY The teen view of Instagram's notification about the Teen Accounts safeguards.\n\nDavis said the three biggest concerns for parents are who their teens are connecting with on the platform, what content they're seeing and how much time they're spending on the phone. It will also give parents the ability to see who their teen has been talking with in the past seven days – though it won't show parents the content of the messages in that conversation.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"I think one of the things to understand is that there's someone else on the other side of that message. So we wouldn't be just sharing the teen's content, but we'd actually be sharing somebody else's content, which creates real privacy concerns,\" Davis said.\n\nShe noted that parents can use the tool to have a conversation with their teen if they see a significant number of messages or those messages are occurring outside the timeframe they're permitted to use the app.\n\nMETA CEO ADMITS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN PRESSURED COMPANY TO CENSOR AMERICANS A view of the parental controls for younger teens in Instagram's Teen Accounts experience.\n\nDavis explained that Instagram's Teen Accounts give parents the ability to set daily time limits for Instagram usage, block them from using the platform at night or within specific time periods, as well as seeing the content and topics that their teen is engaging with on the platform.\n\n\"Teens are developing their, what they call executive functioning skills. These are the skills that sort of allow you to regulate your own behavior, are still developing, that's part of that whole teenage transition to becoming an adult. And what we wanted to do is have those notifications, encourage them to use their own skills to self-regulate,\" she explained.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"But a parent knows when their teen may not be able to actually do that, and to really encourage through these permission settings bringing parents in so if a teen can't do that, has a hard time doing that, a parent can help them do it. A parent can set those boundaries for them,\" Davis added.\n\nMETA'S THREADS TOPS 175 MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS, ZUCKERBERG SAYS\n\nCurrent teen users of Instagram will be placed into the new Teen Accounts format within the next 60 days for residents of the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. The feature will be available in the European Union later this year, while users in other parts of the world will start to get access to Teen Accounts in January.\n\nMeta also noted in the announcement that Teen Accounts will be brought to the companies' other platforms next year, which means that Facebook and Threads users may soon have access to a similar experience.\n\n\"We expect some of them are not going to like these protections. It may actually decrease the time they spend on the platform. It may change the way they do it. We may see some teens try to lie to get around these protections,\" Davis explained, adding that Meta will prompt them to verify their age if they try to sign up as an adult or change their age to get around the safeguards.\n\nAlworth noted that the Senate-passed Kids Online Safety Act, which is pending in the House, would increase regulation of social media platforms and asked whether Instagram's Teen Accounts launch was linked to the legislation's progress.\n\n\"This launch was really designed to take in parents' concerns, to take in their biggest concerns and respond specifically to those concerns,\" Davis said. \"To the extent that policymakers are listening to parents, this change should answer a lot of those concerns.\"\n\nOriginal article source:Instagram releases teen accounts with built-in privacy, parental controls\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A computer on your face? Snap and others still trying to make augmented reality glasses a reality",
        "content": "In its relentless search for ways to weave digital products into people's lives, Big Tech has achieved some big wins. Smart phones are ubiquitous. Apple Watch users talk to their wrists. Artificial intelligence-powered assistants are everywhere.\n\nBut convincing people to wear computers on their faces has been a dud. So far, at least.\n\nAugmented reality glasses overlay digital images onto a person’s view of the physical world. They're different from virtual reality headsets that fully immerse people into a computer-generated environment.\n\nTech giants have been focused in the last decade on developing eye glasses that project digital screens in front of a user's eyes. The fact that they have so far failed to convince people to wear smart glasses daily hasn’t deterred Google and other companies from pouring money into the effort as they pursue a belief the hardware could one day reshape how people socialize, work and learn.\n\nWhile dwarfed by the Silicon Valley behemoths to the north, Snap, the Los Angeles-based company behind the disappearing messaging app Snapchat is competing in this smart glasses arms race. The company, which unveiled its fifth version of AR glasses at its annual conference Tuesday, hopes improving the device will drive mass consumer adoption.\n\nOther industry giants including Google and Samsung are also working on smart glasses and Apple is exploring the idea. The competition raises the stakes for the publicly-traded Snap as it looks to new products to help reassert itself in the tech world as rivals such as Instagram and TikTok have surged past it to capture eyeballs and market dominance.\n\nRead more:Why Silicon Beach didn't live up to the hype as an L.A. tech powerhouse\n\nBut a future in which augmented reality glasses are a part of our daily lives hasn't arrive yet and a long road still remains ahead, experts say. The future of smart glasses is still murky.\n\n“This is a marathon. It's not a sprint,” said Tuong Huy Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner who is part of a team that researches immersive technologies including AR. “We need an ecosystem of not just hardware and software but content to work together to create seamless experiences.”\n\nSnap first released smart glasses that could record video in 2016, selling them in vending machines in Los Angeles before making them available online. The company reported selling 150,000 pairs, but most people stopped using them after a month and underwhelming demand for the gadget resulted in hundreds of thousands of unsold pairs.\n\nNamed Spectacles, Snap's latest eye wear overlays computer-generated images onto a person’s view of the physical world. The new device builds on the first AR glasses Snap released to software developers in 2021. Snap isn't selling to them to the public, but is making them available to software developers in hopes they'll design experiances for the platform.\n\nWhat people can do with AR glasses remain limited. Snap's glasses can track a person’s hands, allowing users to pick up and assemble virtual Legos, swing a phantom golf club, draw with friends and punch numbers in a digital calculator. It also incorporates some artificial intelligence features that allows users to get answers to questions and conjure an image with a voice command.\n\nIn an attempt to drum up interest, Snap has been leaning into whimsical applications and gaming experiences that it knows users are used to, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a consulting firm that works with tech companies.\n\nRead more:Snapchat Spectacles, available only in pop-up vending machines, debut to long lines\n\nBut Snap is still treading cautiously as it releases new AR glasses.\n\n“What we can't predict is consumer adoption and so that's why we're taking this more thoughtful approach to how we're releasing this version,” said Sophia Dominguez, Snap’s director of AR Platform. “It could change at any time, and if it does change…we're ready to go.”\n\nDominguez said the company envisions AR glasses one day becoming the primary way people access the digital world. Instead of computer or phone screens, AR glasses, she said, will allow people to keep one foot in each world simultaneously, making it \"easy for you to interact with technology in the same way that you interact with the real world.”\n\nSkepticism whether AR glasses will make this possible runs high.\n\nDonning AR glasses could interfere with how people socialize in the physical world, making them feel less present, said Jeremy Bailenson, a Stanford University professor who founded the college’s virtual human interaction lab.\n\n“Wearing glasses that connect you to digital content, whether it's AR or VR should be done sparingly for special experiences,” he said. “I am not an advocate of blocking your perceptual system, sight and sound for constant surveillance.”\n\nBailenson and other Stanford researchers tested out the Meta Quest 3, a “mixed reality” headset that lets people blend physical and virtual worlds. While the headset is different from AR glasses, the gadget can display real-time video of a user’s surroundings in the physical world.\n\nResearchers, who were accompanied by a chaperone for safety reasons, wore Meta’s headsets while chatting with people, walking around campus and cooking food. They reported that people in the physical world felt less real as if they were watching television rather than interacting with someone face-to-face.\n\nPeople wearing AR glasses will also see a different view of the world than people not wearing the devices and losing that “common ground” will likely impact the way people socialize, Bailenson said.\n\nPrevious attempts at integrating smart glasses into people's lives have not gone well. When Google released smart glasses in 2013 that could shoot photos, videos, they sparked privacy and safety concerns from consumers, lawmakers and business owners. People started calling Google Glass owners who used the smart glasses in ways that were socially unacceptable “glassholes.” Among the social no-nos: Surreptitiously recording others and reading on the device while seeming to ignore others.\n\nAnd while AR glasses have the potential to be helpful in several arenas, including training, education, shopping and gaming, industry analysts said it will be difficult convincing consumers to embrace the devices.\n\n\"Our eyes are very precious real estate,\" said Bajarin, who tried out Snap's AR glasses ahead of their conference. \"Consumers are going to guard that very, very heavily.\"\n\nKeeping the price low enough to entice people to buy will also be a challenge. Meta, which partnered with Ray Ban on a pair of smart glasses that allows people to capture photos, listen to music and take video calls with the help of an AI assistant, sells its device for around $300. Snap has not said what it will charge for its latest glasses should they become available to the public.\n\nRead more:Evan Spiegel: The old man of social media\n\nSnap's glasses remain a work in progress. They’re heavier than regular glasses, heat up to an uncomfortable degree after extended use and the battery life is under an hour. They require foreign hand movements, such as reaching out to pinch digital objects in the air and tapping the front and back of one's hand to adjust the volume or launch a menu.\n\nThe device is powered by Snap's own operating system, giving the company more control over the experience. During a recent preview of the AR glasses held in a San Francisco home, a Times reporter used voice commands to create images that appeared almost instantly — a robot dog, Elsa from Frozen and the San Francisco skyline.\n\nIn another activity, a wide-eyed, yellow creature appeared before making its way outside to a real San Francisco patio with a stunning view of the city. Niantic, the maker of AR game Pokemon Go, created the experience “Peridot Beyond” for Snap’s AR glasses.\n\nAsim Ahmed, who leads global marketing at Niantic, said AR glasses gives the company the opportunity to experiment and design a “new kind of paradigm of gameplay.” What works in a game played on a mobile phone might not work on AR glasses, which offer a wider field of view and don’t rely so heavily on hands to play. Niantic also had to think about safety issues, including making sure the virtual pet doesn’t get too close to their owner and blocks their view.\n\nWith an array of challenges, including figuring out how to jam processing power and other computing hardware into a device that is smaller than a smartphone, analysts predict it will take several years at least before smart glasses gain mainstream adoption, if they ever do.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, shipments of VR and AR headsets dropped 67.4% year-over-year but are expected to improve as consumers transition to new types of devices, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Meta led the market, followed by ByteDance, Xreal and HTC.\n\nWith companies still testing out AR glasses or developing them, a clear front-runner hasn't emerged yet, analysts said.\n\nJacob Bourne, an analyst at eMarketer, said Snap's rivals including Meta and Google have more money to invest in research and development of AR glasses. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has 3.27 billion people use one of their apps every day compared to Snapchat, which has 432 million daily active users.\n\n\"I would probably put my money more on Meta as having the key to the [research and development] capabilities to really get that to market,\" Bourne said. \"But I wouldn't rule Snap out at all.\"\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Snapchat Redesigns Feed in Bid to Keep Young Users’ Attention",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. announced a redesign of its popular Snapchat app, including an updated algorithm for ranking and recommending video content, part of a plan to better compete with rivals like TikTok and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough To Build Community, Design for Density An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nThe new design will change the look of Snapchat’s home screen, creating more focus on the camera, chat messages with friends and videos. The redesign will also combine Snapchat’s two existing video feeds, which show content from friends and content creators, respectively, into one feed. The company is rolling out a new algorithm to rank and recommend that video content to Snapchat’s more than 850 million monthly users.\n\n“Right now our community has to go to two different places to get the content that they love from the creators they follow and of course from areas of interest that they’re discovering,” Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said in an interview before the event. “That’s not only a challenge in terms of user interface, it’s also been a challenge historically on the ranking recommendation, because those ranking systems were separate.”\n\nThe redesign comes as Snap looks to better compete with Instagram and ByteDance Ltd.-owned TikTok for the attention of young people, who are increasingly spending their time watching videos online.\n\nSnap has traditionally focused on helping users share and view content from friends and family, including through ephemeral videos called Stories. But the rise of TikTok and other short-form video products has motivated companies like Snap and Meta to lean more aggressively into recommending content from outside of a user’s network.\n\nTikTok, which is known for its viral videos, grew popular in part because its recommendation algorithms can promote content on the app even if the original creator doesn’t have a lot of followers. It’s a strategy that helps creators find new audiences and go viral, and helps viewers discover new posts they didn’t know they wanted.\n\nThe rest of the social media industry has rushed to catch up. Snapchat, for example, introduced its own TikTok-like video feed, called Spotlight, in 2020, and Instagram also has a competing product called Reels.\n\nInstagram updated its algorithm earlier this year to recommend more content from smaller creators, even if users didn’t follow them, and Meta executives have been vocal about the company’s pivot toward recommendations.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap has also invested heavily in technologies to improve the way it ranks and recommends video content to users. The company is spending roughly $1.5 billion this year on infrastructure to support artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, which in turn help power its recommendation algorithm.\n\nThe more time people spend watching video content on Snapchat, the more ads they can see. Snapchat’s monthly users are already spending 25% more time watching video content on Snapchat than they did a year ago, the company told investors last month. That has helped boost the advertising business, which is on track for record annual revenue this year, Spiegel said.\n\nSnap introduced several other new features as part of its annual Partner Summit in Santa Monica, Calif., including AI that can automatically add captions or filters to images. It also announced updates to its AI chatbot that enable it to translate menus in a foreign language or identify plants from pictures taken on Snapchat.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Business Schools Are Undergoing Unusual Change Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "title": "Instagram unveils Teen Accounts with mandatory parental controls",
        "content": "Teens will find it a little bit harder to start Instagram accounts moving forward.\n\nMeta has introduced a new type of Instagram account specifically for teens, which includes significantly more parental supervision tools. Teens under 16 will automatically have the strongest parental control settings, while parents of older teens can adjust their amount of oversight. Instagram users who fall in the teenage range will automatically be placed into the teen accounts once they go live.\n\nTeen Account holders will be automatically opted into the highest privacy settings, making their accounts private and prohibiting them from messaging strangers. Those settings cannot be changed without the approval of a parent.\n\nParents will also be able to monitor which the accounts kids are sending messages to, but will be unable to read those messages. They can also limit the amount of time kids spend in the app and see the topics their kids are looking at in their feed.\n\n“This new experience is designed to better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place,” the company wrote in a blog post.\n\nTo prevent teens from just entering a fake birthday to get around the restrictions, Meta says it’s building technology to proactively find accounts that belong to teens, even if it has an adult birthday. (That’s expected to go live early next year.) It’s also requiring new signups to verify their age.\n\nTeens should be in the teen accounts within 60 days, the company says, in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia. Users in The European Union will begin the shift later this year.\n\nMeta has been on the defensive about how it handles young users since a whistleblower leaked internal documents suggesting Facebook knowingly prioritized profit over well-being and safety. The controversy led to a congressional testimony and spurred debate about what could be done to protect minors online. In October 2023, more than 30 US states filed a lawsuit against Meta alleging harmful youth marketing.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What are share buybacks?",
        "content": "A boom in share buybacks has seen a number of companies using this strategy to return money to investors and boost the value of their stock.\n\nTech company Microsoft (MSFT) has announced a $60bn (£45.4bn) share buyback programme, while also raising its quarterly dividend by 10%.\n\nIt isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" tech company to announce a huge buyback in 2024, with Apple (AAPL) launching a $110bn repurchasing plan and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) also unveiling a $70bn programme. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Facebook-parent Meta (META) have announced $50bn buyback programmes in 2024.\n\nBuybacks have also grown in popularity in the UK, as major London-listed companies such as oil major BP (BP.L) and bank Barclays (BARC.L) have launched their own buyback plans.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nA share repurchase, or share buyback, is when a company rebuys its own shares and returns funds to its investors.\n\nThe issuing company usually acquires its own stock by distributing cash to existing holders, paying the market value per share, in exchange for a portion of the company’s outstanding equity.\n\nRead more: Bank of England bond sales could cost government almost £100bn by 2028\n\nWhen a company repurchases its own shares, this reduces the number of shares held by the public.\n\nCompanies can purchase the stock on the open market or from shareholders directly.\n\nWhy do companies do this?\n\nBuybacks became particularly popular during the Covid pandemic as the economic fallout left companies with mounting debt piles from loans and government bailouts. Repurchasing shares enabled firms to reduce debt, shore up their finances and consolidate ownership.\n\nShare buybacks globally hit a record $1.31tn in 2022, but then dipped back $1.11tn last year, according to Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed that share buybacks were nearing their lowest annual value since 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe aggregate value of share buyback transactions for companies trading on major global exchanges through to 9 September 2024 was nearly $164bn, down 35% on the same period last year. That figure was also even lower than the nearly $179bn in buybacks in the comparable period in 2020.\n\nDespite this slowdown in the amount companies are repurchasing, the strategy is still popular, with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed the number of buybacks is up year-on-year.\n\nRead more: Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\n\nThere were 983 buyback transactions worldwide this year up to 9 September, up from 823 for the same period last year and the highest number since the first nine months of 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to shoring up finances, buybacks also provide a more flexible way of returning money to shareholders as an alternative to dividends. Public companies have a goal of maximising returns for their investors, so if a firm is generating more cash than it needs to fund its operations, buybacks are a good option for excess cash.\n\nShare repurchases also increase the company’s equity value, and help businesses to look more financially attractive to investors.\n\nIf a board feels that its company’s stock is undervalued, buybacks are one way to solve this, and are often seen as an expression of confidence by the company.\n\nNot only do they provide an additional exit route to shareholders when shares are undervalued or are thinly traded, but also prevent unwelcome takeover bids.\n\nHowever, as they are typically financed with debt, it can sometimes strain cash flow.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nAs share repurchases cut the total number of shares outstanding, and the total amount of cash on the firm’s balance sheet, this affects several metrics used by investors to estimate a company’s valuation.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nSome of these metrics include earnings per share (EPS), a measure used by investors, and the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nFewer shares in circulation increases a company’s EPS, and a higher EPS normally means a higher share price.\n\nRecent share repurchases\n\nOutside of the major US tech companies, there have been a number of buyback announcements this year.\n\nBP launched a new buyback of $1.75bn in February, with plans to repurchase at least $14bn in shares over 2024-25.\n\nFellow oil major Shell (SHEL.L) also announced a $3.5bn buyback programme earlier in the year.\n\nBarclays also shared its intention to repurchase a further £750m of its shares in August, as part of plans return at least £10bn in capital to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAnother bank to declare a buyback was HSBC (HSBA.L), which announced a repurchasing programme of up to $3bn in July.\n\nEuropean banks have also jumped on the trend, with Italy's UniCredit (UCG.MI) initiating its €1.7bn (£1.4bn) repurchasing plan on Monday, while Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.SW) also launched a $2bn programme.\n\nMeanwhile, UK supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L) also committed in April to buying back an additional £1bn worth of shares by April 2025.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Instagram makes teen accounts private as pressure mounts on the app to protect children",
        "content": "Instagram is introducing separate teen accounts for those under 18 as it tries to make the platform safer for children amid a growing backlash against how social media affects young people's lives.\n\nBeginning Tuesday in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia, anyone under under 18 who signs up for Instagram will be placed into a teen account and those with existing accounts will be migrated over the next 60 days. Teens in the European Union will see their accounts adjusted later this year.\n\nMeta acknowledges that teenagers may lie about their age and says it will require them to verify their ages in more instances, like if they try to create a new account with an adult birthday. The Menlo Park, California company also said it is building technology that proactively finds teen accounts that pretend to be grownups and automatically places them into the restricted teen accounts.\n\nThe teen accounts will be private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. “Sensitive content,” such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a “sleep mode” will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m.\n\nWhile these settings will be turned on for all teens, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to turn them off. Kids under 16 will need their parents' permission to do so.\n\n“The three concerns we’re hearing from parents are that their teens are seeing content that they don’t want to see or that they’re getting contacted by people they don’t want to be contacted by or that they’re spending too much on the app,” said Naomi Gleit, head of product at Meta. “So teen accounts is really focused on addressing those three concerns.”\n\nThe announcement comes as the company faces lawsuits from dozens of U.S. states that accuse it of harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms.\n\nIn the past, Meta's efforts at addressing teen safety and mental health on its platforms have been met with criticism that the changes don't go far enough. For instance, while kids will get a notification when they've spent 60 minutes on the app, they will be able to bypass it and continue scrolling.\n\nThat's unless the child's parents turn on “parental supervision” mode, where parents can limit teens' time on Instagram to a specific amount of time, such as 15 minutes.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the latest changes, Meta is giving parents more options to oversee their kids' accounts. Those under 16 will need a parent or guardian's permission to change their settings to less restrictive ones. They can do this by setting up “parental supervision” on their accounts and connecting them to a parent or guardian.\n\nNick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said last week that parents don't use the parental controls the company has introduced in recent years.\n\nGleit said she thinks teen accounts will create a “big incentive for parents and teens to set up parental supervision.”\n\n“Parents will be able to see, via the family center, who is messaging their teen and hopefully have a conversation with their teen,” she said. “If there is bullying or harassment happening, parents will have visibility into who their teen’s following, who’s following their teen, who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and hopefully have some of these conversations and help them navigate these really difficult situations online.”\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that tech companies put too much on parents when it comes to keeping children safe on social media.\n\n“We’re asking parents to manage a technology that’s rapidly evolving that fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world — and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage,” Murthy said in May 2023.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is rolling out special accounts with new privacy settings for teenaged Instagram users, it said on Tuesday, its latest effort to limit their exposure to harmful content on its apps amid regulatory pressure.\n\nThe social media firm said it will port all designated accounts automatically to teen accounts, which will be private accounts by default.\n\nUsers of such accounts can only be messaged and tagged by accounts they follow or are already connected to, while sensitive content settings will be dialed to the most restrictive available.\n\nUsers under 16 years of age can change the default settings only with a parent's permission. Parents will also get a suite of settings to monitor who their children are engaging with and limit their use of the app.\n\nSeveral studies have linked social media use to higher levels of depression, anxiety and learning disabilities, particularly in young users.\n\nMeta, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube already face hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of children and school districts about the addictive nature of social media. Last year, 33 U.S. states including California and New York sued the company for misleading the public about the dangers of its platforms.\n\nTop platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, allow users who are 13 years of age and above to sign up.\n\nMeta's move comes three years after it abandoned development on a version of the Instagram app meant for teenagers, after lawmakers and advocacy groups urged the company to drop it, citing safety concerns.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Senate advanced two online safety bills - The Kids Online Safety Act and The Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act - that would force social media companies to take responsibility for how their platforms affect children and teens.\n\nMeta said it will place the identified users into teen accounts within 60 days in the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia, and in the European Union later this year. Teens around the world will start to get teen accounts in January.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Janane Venkatraman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Instagram Rolls Out Restrictive New Privacy Settings for Teenagers",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Instagram is changing the default privacy settings for many US teenagers, part of an effort to keep them safer and give parents more control over how their kids interact online.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPipeline Fire Near Houston Forces Some Residents to Evacuate London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life\n\nThe new settings will make teen accounts private by default, limit who those users can send private messages to, and put teens in the “most restrictive” tier when it comes to viewing sensitive content. That means the app will block teens from seeing sensitive photos and videos, including posts that show people fighting or certain cosmetic procedures.\n\nThese more restrictive settings will be turned on automatically for all Instagram users under 18 years of age, the company said Tuesday, though 16- and 17-year-olds can change them on their own. If a younger teen tries to evade the new restrictions by changing their birthday on the service, Meta said it will use artificial intelligence technology to try and “proactively find these teens and place them” into more restrictive accounts.\n\nThe restrictions for those under 16 can be relaxed if a parent provides permission via their own Instagram account.\n\nThe widespread changes come after years of criticism that Instagram, which is owned by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc., has failed to adequately protect young people online. Meta was sued last year by a group of more than 30 states alleging the company’s apps are harming young people, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg appeared at a congressional hearing earlier this year on child safety where Meta was criticized for enabling child sexual exploitation. Zuckerberg has fought in court to avoid facing personal liability for any alleged harms.\n\nIn 2021, a Facebook whistleblower went public with hundreds of pages of internal Meta documents, including the company’s own research that found Instagram had a negative impact on the mental health for some teen girls.\n\nInstagram boss Adam Mosseri said the new policies and restrictions have been in the works for the better part of a year, and that they weren’t designed to appease angry lawmakers. “Honestly, it’s not designed for any of them,” he said. “My hope is that it’s received well by parents and by teens because that’s exactly who it’s designed for.”\n\nThe new account settings represent the company’s most aggressive effort to date to protect younger users. Teens will only be able to receive messages from people they already follow or that they are already connected to and can only be tagged or mentioned by users they follow. Teens will also receive a notification to leave the app after 60 minutes of use each day.\n\nStory continues\n\nParents will also be able to see which accounts their teen is messaging, but won’t be able to read the actual messages.\n\nMosseri said the idea behind the increased restrictions is similar to the plan Meta had for “Instagram Youth,” a proposal for a version of the app for kids under 13. That plan was scrapped in 2021, and Mosseri said there is no plan to revive it.\n\nIt’s possible these new “Teen Accounts,” as Meta is calling them, will make their way to other company apps, including Facebook. “It’s faster to start on one app and then learn and iterate and fast follow across the rest of the family” of apps, Mosseri said.\n\nThe new restrictions will be live to all users under 18 in the US, UK, Canada and Australia within the next 60 days, and Meta plans to deploy them to the rest of the European Union later this year. They’ll be deployed globally starting early in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Business Schools Are Undergoing Unusual Change Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Instagram parent Meta (META) announced a series of features for the social network on Tuesday that it says are designed to protect teen users from interacting with inappropriate accounts and content. Meta says it will automatically begin putting teen users under 16 into Instagram Teen Accounts beginning today. The feature puts limits on who teens can message, who can tag them, and what they see in the app.\n\nUsers’ accounts will be put into private mode, meaning teens will need to accept new followers and that people who don’t follow them can’t see their content. Teens will only be able to message people they follow or are connected with.\n\nSensitive content control will keep teen users from being able to see things like fighting or posts promoting cosmetic procedures in their Explore and Reels tabs, while time limit reminders will tell teens to leave the app after using it for 60 minutes in a day. A sleep mode will also turn on between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., muting notifications and sending automatic replies to messages.\n\nTeens under 16 will have to get their parents to change any settings, and in the future, the company says, parents will be able to change app settings without their teens sending requests first. A look at how Instagram's teen accounts will look for young users. (Image: Meta) (Meta)\n\nMeta’s Instagram Teen Accounts comes after 42 state attorneys general called on Congress to allow Surgeon General Vivek Murthy to affix a warning label to social media apps in a letter last week. In the note, the attorneys general said social media platforms are fueling a “mental health crisis” among young people and that a surgeon general’s warning on algorithm-powered social platforms could help address the matter.\n\n“A growing body of research links young people’s use of those social media platforms to a variety of serious psychological harms, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation,” the attorneys general wrote in their letter to Congressman Mike Johnson and Senators Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell.\n\n“Algorithm-driven social media use also interferes with adolescents’ daily life by chronically disrupting their sleep with irresistible algorithmic recommendations, infinite scrolling, and a constant stream of notifications designed to keep kids relentlessly engaged on the platform.”\n\nThe letter follows a New York Times op-ed Murthy wrote in June in which he laid out his case for why social media platforms need surgeon general warnings and requested that Congress pass legislation to curtail social media’s impact on younger users.\n\n“Legislation from Congress should shield young people from online harassment, abuse and exploitation and from exposure to extreme violence and sexual content that too often appears in algorithm-driven feeds,\" he wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta says it’s working to ensure teens don’t access content outside of Instagram Teen Accounts by requiring them to verify their age if they try to use a new account tied to their old account with an adult birthday to make them appear older.\n\nThe company also says it’s building technology to identify accounts set up by teens lying about their birthdays to get access to the full Instagram experience. Meta says the capability will allow it to automatically move offending accounts into Instagram Teen Accounts even if they use adult birthdays.\n\nThe company, however, points out that it will take more than app changes to prevent teens from skirting app rules, saying it’s important for companies and governments to work together to find a solution.\n\nMeta is facing an onslaught of lawsuits related to teen use of its social media apps. In 2023, a series of states filed a lawsuit against Meta for allegedly designing its platforms to be addictive to teens. In February, New York City joined a long list of school districts suing social media companies over what they say are negative effects of their platforms.

        "title": "Facebook owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over 'foreign interference'",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Meta said it's banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow's propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday.\n\nThe company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia's covert influence operations.\n\n“After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\" Meta said in a prepared statement.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that “such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,” and that “Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.”\n\n“We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,” Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call.\n\nMeta's actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries.\n\nU.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere.\n\nEarlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages.\n\nMoscow has rejected the allegations.\n\nTwo years ago, Meta took steps to limit Moscow's online influence by taking down a sprawling disinformation network originating in Russia that sought to use hundreds of fake social media accounts and dozens of sham news websites to spread Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian authorities designated Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocked Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn April, a court in Russia convicted Meta communications director Andy Stone of justifying terrorism and sentenced him to six years in prison in a swift trial in absentia. The charges against Stone stemmed from his remarks in 2022 following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 that year.\n\nStone, who is based in the United States, announced temporary changes to Meta’s hate speech policy to allow for “forms of political expression that would normally violate (its) rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders.’”\n\nIn the same statement, Stone added that “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians” would remain banned. The Russian authorities opened a criminal case implicating Stone and other unidentified Meta employees nonetheless, describing the statement as “illegal calls to violence and killings of Russian citizens.”\n\n___\n\nDasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Can you become a millionaire by investing in stocks? Absolutely. But there are a couple of key rules to follow. It's important to diversify your investments across a broad range of solid companies, and it's key to invest for the long term. You'll have a much better chance of reaching your goal if you hold on to quality stocks for a period of 10 years or longer than if you bail out after a few weeks or months.\n\nOf course, it's possible that even by following these guidelines you won't pocket millions -- but there's a very strong likelihood you'll still find yourself in a fantastic financial position down the road if you choose wisely now and stick with investing for the long haul.\n\nToday, a great way to offer your portfolio a boost or get started with a bang if you're new to investing is to buy a couple of leading technology stocks that are likely to continue their leadership well into the future. I'm thinking of two with terrific earnings and share performance track records, and plenty of potential ahead. These two players won't do the job alone -- but it's unlikely that any one stock will make you a millionaire unless you invest a tremendous amount in just that player. And that's much too risky. These top tech stockscould help make you a millionaire, though. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of my favorite tech stocks because of its diversification and leadership in two high-growth areas. The company dominates in both e-commerce and cloud computing. On top of this, Amazon also is on the road to becoming one of the biggest winners in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon's Prime subscription program and focus on keeping prices low and delivery fast should help it stay ahead. Annual sales events such as Prime Day help the company bring in new members -- and the member retention rate is high. Over the first three months of 2023, 99% of Prime members renewed their memberships for a second year, according to Statista. Since members pay for Prime, it's in their best interest to do as much of their shopping as possible on Amazon -- all of this points to more potential growth ahead.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader worldwide, and its focus on AI has already started to add even more growth to the picture. AWS recently reached an annual revenue run rate of $105 billion thanks to its AI products and services -- AWS offers everything from chips to a full service called Amazon Bedrock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese businesses have helped Amazon grow revenue and net income into the billions of dollars -- and the company's revamping of its cost structure a couple of years ago makes it more efficient than ever. All of this makes Amazon a no-brainer buy for your millionaire-maker portfolio.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), like Amazon, is a leader in its field. As owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company is a social media giant. More than 3.2 billion people around the world use at least one of these apps every day.\n\nImportantly, Meta has a rock-solid moat, or competitive advantage, that should keep it in the top spot. It's very difficult for users to drop Facebook or WhatsApp, for example, because they know that if they do, many of their contacts won't be present on other platforms -- this offers confidence that Meta will maintain its leadership.\n\nBut Meta isn't relying on this moat alone. The company is working to make its social media apps better and better thanks to its focus on AI. The goal is to have an AI available to suit everyone's needs -- from professional to leisure -- down the road. Meta already launched its first AI assistant, backed by its own large language model, and has said that its biggest investment area this year is in AI.\n\nHow does all of this translate into earnings? Meta sells advertising to advertisers, who hope to reach all of us where they can find us: on Meta's apps. By making these apps better and better through AI, we'll use them more -- and advertisers may therefore spend more.\n\nAs it stands, advertising already has brought Meta billions of dollars in earnings. And the company even felt comfortable enough with its financial situation earlier this year to launch its first-ever dividend -- saying it can afford to both reward shareholders and invest in growth. So, through Meta, you can collect dividends, and benefit from what likely will be a long period of growth down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Walmart, Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, Alphabet Meta, Oracle's and Nvidia's",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Walmart WMT, Procter & Gamble PG and Coca-Cola KO, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Oracle’s ORCL and Nvidia’s NVDA.\n\nTech Stocks Are Cheap, Value Expensive: A Rare Opportunity?\n\nIn recent months, we've witnessed a significant rotation in the stock market, with investors gravitating toward defensive, value-oriented stocks as they brace for an economic slowdown and potential shifts in interest rate policy.\n\nThis flight to safety has caused many value stocks—traditionally considered stable but slow-growing—to become highly sought after, driving their valuations higher. At the same time, tech stocks, known for their growth potential, have seen their prices drop, creating an unusual dynamic where some of the market’s most innovative companies are now trading at lower relative valuations.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity for investors. While value stocks like Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola have been bid up due to their perceived safety, tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms are now priced very attractively. Despite their lower valuations, these tech companies still have superior growth prospects, making this a rare moment where investors can acquire high-growth stocks at a discount, while more defensive stocks have become relatively expensive.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore how this market dynamic has unfolded and why tech’s current pricing could be an opportunity you don’t want to miss.\n\nDefensive Stocks Have Led the Market\n\nIf you have been following my recent write-ups you will know that I have been talking about this rotation for some time now. Below we can see that defensive ETFs such as Value, Healthcare and Utilities have held up better than Tech and the broad market over the last few months.\n\nWhile it has been a good ride for those that were early in the trend, I am not sure this theme will continue much longer. In the chart above, we can see how stark the comparative valuations are now, with the tech stocks trading lower forward multiples than the value stocks.\n\nHowever, the narrative has begun to shift and after several months of consolidation, tech stocks appear primed for the next leg higher. In addition to the now attractive valuations, chatter and activity surrounding Artificial Intelligence is picking up again, which should lure investors back to tech. Apple just released its newest AI enabled iPhones and Oracle’s Larry Ellison is talking about building thousands of new data centers. Ellison also said that at a dinner recently with Elon Musk and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, that he and Elon were begging Jensen for more GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Growth Forecasts: Tech vs. Value\n\nWhen we compare the earnings growth projections for tech to value the disparity is striking. Over the next 3-5 years, tech stocks are expected to deliver far superior earnings growth.\n\nAlphabet: Analysts project GOOGL to achieve 17.5% annual EPS growth over the next few years. This growth is driven by the company’s dominance in digital advertising, its strong position in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and its thriving cloud services segment through Google Cloud. Meta Platforms: META is forecasted to grow its earnings at an even more impressive rate of 19% annually. This growth comes from its continuing dominance in social media advertising, its shift to AI-enhanced tools for advertising and user engagement. Walmart: On the other hand, retail giant Walmart is expected to grow its EPS at a much more modest rate of 8.2%. While Walmart has invested heavily in e-commerce and technology to adapt to changing consumer habits, it still faces slower growth due to its mature market and tight margins in retail. Procter & Gamble: A defensive stock like PG, known for its household consumer products, has an EPS growth forecast of 6.6%. While PG offers steady earnings, its growth prospects are limited by its reliance on mature markets and a slower pace of innovation compared to tech. Coca-Cola: Finally, Coca-Cola’s expected growth rate of 6.3% reflects its role as a staple in the consumer staples sector. KO’s focus on beverages, while lucrative and reliable, doesn’t offer the same explosive growth potential as tech companies operating in rapidly evolving industries like AI and digital media.\n\nShould Investors Buy GOOGL and META Stock?\n\nGrowth forecasts clearly favor tech stocks like GOOGL and META. Their earnings are expected to compound at rates more than double that of traditional value stocks like WMT, PG, and KO. This highlights a key point: while value stocks provide stability, their limited growth potential makes them less attractive for investors seeking high returns over the long term. On top of that, tech stocks now offer better relative valuations following the recent rotation into defensive stocks, making them an even more compelling buy.\n\nFor example, GOOGL and META, despite their higher growth potential, currently trade at forward P/E multiples lower than their historical averages, as investors have become more cautious on tech. Meanwhile, WMT, PG, and KO, with slower growth prospects, are trading at elevated P/E ratios compared to their historical norms, as investors have flocked to these defensive names amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThis unusual dynamic presents a rare opportunity for investors. Buying tech stocks with high growth potential at attractive valuations can offer a combination of both growth and value. On the flip side, while value stocks provide near-term safety, they may be fully priced, with limited upside left if growth fails to materialize.\n\nFor investors, the key takeaway is that tech stocks are offering a better balance of growth potential and reasonable valuations, while value stocks, despite their recent popularity, may be nearing their upside potential.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Among Cantor Fitzgerald’s Top Internet Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\n\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\n\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\n\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\n\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\n\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\n\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\n\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\n\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 26%\n\nCantor's Rating: Overweight\n\nCantor's Share Price Target: $660\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the dominant player in the global social media industry and owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As per Cantor, it is one of the strongest players in the artificial intelligence industry and can capture market share. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s AI products and services are built on its Llama foundational model - which is also among the few truly open source AI models in the world. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is using Llama to add value for advertisers on its bread and butter platform Facebook, and it is also aiming to target social media users through products such as AI Studio to allow them to create their own AI variants. Cantor believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can create AI growth over the next two to three years, and adds that the firm's fiscal 2025 P/E ratio of 20 implies that investors have factored in the risk of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) failing to adequately monetize AI and ad revenue growth slowing down.\n\nEvercore analyst Mark Mahaney shared how Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is monetizing AI during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\n“If you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that’s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.”\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) ended the recent trading session at $533.28, demonstrating a +1.65% swing from the preceding day's closing price.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other big tech stocks.\n\nThe State of Big Tech Right Now\n\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\n\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of  AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\n\nHow Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors?\n\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\n\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\n\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is Mark Zuckerberg's social media company that has gained immense fame over the past few decades. It is based in Menlo Park, California.\n\nSince Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in the internet economy, many investors are awed by the position it holds and the number of popular social media platforms it owns. Because of this, the company also has about 18% of the global market for digital advertising sales since its social media platforms enable it to generate huge amounts of ad revenue.\n\nAnother reason why Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is gaining investors is its focused approach to AI integration. This is one of the most aggressive companies when it comes to building a network infrastructure and computing power, and it has about $37-40 billion set aside to spend on AI just this year. Through AI spending, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) aims to enhance user experience on its platforms by adding greater functionality and boosting advertisers' ability to target their audience.\n\nWith all this, some may be wary about Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) intense spending habits. However, in the second quarter, the company announced a 38% operating margin and generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ended the quarter with a net cash position of $40 billion - so many investors' concerns have been alleviated.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was spotted in the portfolios of 219 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $42.5 billion.\n\nRowan Street Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Over the past several years, it has tried to leave around one million square feet of office space in Austin. In 2022, it announced it would not be moving into the 586,000-square-foot space it leased at the recently completed Sixth & Guadalupe Tower, currently the tallest in Austin at 865 feet. Last year, the company also put 120,000 square feet at 300 West Sixth Street into the sublease pool. It still has 320,000 square feet of space at the Third + Shoal building.\n\nMeta's office footprint is also shrinking in Bellevue, WA, where it has leased several properties, some of which are now up for sublease. Last year, it subleased its space in Fremont, CA, to a pharmaceutical company. It listed its 435,000-square-foot space at 181 Fremont in San Francisco for sublease in 2023 and potential interested tenants have included TikTok and Zendesk.\n\nThe Austin office market has been experiencing a lot of supply coming online at the same time that many companies are reconsidering their relationship with office space. Many tech companies have at least some footprint in the booming state capital but some have been reducing or scaling back their efforts. In recent months, as much as 20% of Austin's office space has been vacant. Deals are still getting done but are often smaller leases under 100,000 square feet as companies reconsider their relationship with large headquarters.\n\nInvest In Texas\n\nReady to be part of the Texas market without having to buy or manage property?

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg's Wealth Skyrockets by $51 Billion This Year, Putting Him on Track to Claim the Title of Richest Person on Earth\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms’ CEO, has added a jaw-dropping $51 billion to his fortune this year, bringing his total net worth to $179 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This places him in fourth place, trailing just behind some of the biggest names in the business world: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nZuckerberg's year started in sixth place, but he recently overtook luxury magnate Arnault to briefly claim third place, only to slip back again. However, with his wealth climbing, the Meta chief might soon return to the top three.\n\nAs technology fortunes are known to be highly unpredictable, Zuckerberg could quickly close the gap. \"It wouldn't take much,\" said one analyst. “A bad day for Tesla or Amazon and a good one for Meta could shuffle things around.”\n\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nWith a fortune of $248 billion, Elon Musk is the richest person on the planet, followed by Bezos at $202 billion and Arnault at $180 billion. However, Zuckerberg is gaining ground. Musk was worth just $164 billion in April, and Bezos wasn't far ahead of Zuckerberg in January, highlighting how fast fortunes can change in the tech world.\n\nInterestingly, philanthropy could also play a role. Musk and Bezos have yet to make any large donations this year. Still, if they were to follow Warren Buffett’s example – who has given away over half his Berkshire Hathaway stock – Zuckerberg could find himself at the top of the list. “That's how Buffett kept himself from being the richest person alive,” a financial expert pointed out.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg's fortune surged by $51 billion, Musk and Bezos only added $19 billion and $25 billion, respectively. At 40, Zuckerberg still has plenty of time to grow his wealth, potentially surpassing Musk, who is 53, and Bezos, who is 60. Morgan Housel, author of The Psychology of Money, once remarked that Warren Buffett built 99% of his wealth after age 65, proving that time is a powerful ally in growing money.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite being far younger than other moguls like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, Zuckerberg already commands a fortune larger than theirs, as well as that of Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nSee Also:Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nFacebook, which he founded in 2004 at the age of 19, is now part of Meta, the seventh-largest public company in the world. Meta is valued at $1.3 trillion, overtaking even long-standing giants like Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Musk's Tesla.\n\nZuckerberg's wealth, however, hasn't been on a smooth upward trajectory. Between September 2021 and November 2022, Meta's stock plummeted by over 75%, bringing Zuckerberg's fortune down to a modest $35 billion. Investors grew wary of his massive bets on the metaverse and the broader tech stock sell-off.\n\nFast forward to today. Meta stock has rebounded fivefold, driven by investor optimism around AI and Zuckerberg's tighter grip on spending. The stock is now hovering around record highs, above $500, and Zuckerberg's wealth has soared alongside it.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThe startup behind White Castle's favorite Robot Fry Cook announces a next-generation fast food robot – Here's how to get a share for under $5 today.

        "title": "Analyst Highlights New AI Growth Catalysts for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.\n\nLee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\n“ A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it’s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it’s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative,” Lee said.\n\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Facebook application login page, Apple iPad Air, tablet, logo\n\nBloomua / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) continues to gain attention from Wall Street analysts thanks to its explosive AI potential.\n\nD.A. Davidson analysts started covering Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) with a “buy” rating, naming it a top pick among mega-cap stocks. They believe Meta is positioned to lead in open source for two key tech platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nD.A. Davidson analysts said that while past tech innovation was driven by startups, the scale and capital required for AI and Spatial computing mean only mega-cap companies can dominate. While companies like Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are focused on closed platforms, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) leads the open-source side.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm praised Meta’s open-sourcing of AI tools like Llama, PyTorch, and FAISS, which they say has positioned the company as the leader in AI foundational model compute. Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) advancements in AI have already improved ad delivery and returns, making it easier to justify its AI investments and open-source strategy.\n\nOn Spatial computing, D.A. Davidson pointed to Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) heavy spending on Reality Labs as strengthening its position as the open-source counterpart to Apple’s closed ecosystem. They also commended CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership in navigating challenges.\n\nDavidson set a price target of $600 for Meta Platforms Inc(NASDAQ:META).\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\n\nWe would like to remind you that achieving these types of returns is never a straight path. From time to time, we might experience volatility — that’s simply part of the investment journey. In fact, wealth creation and volatility go hand in hand. There’s no escaping it; it’s the “price of admission” the market demands. If you take a look at the chart below, you’ll notice the drawdowns META stock has faced over the years, with 2022 standing out as a particularly challenging period, where the stock saw a 75% drop…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "10 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "One way to make money as an investor, and possibly become a millionaire or multimillionaire in the process, is to pay attention to growing trends and expanding technologies -- and to invest in the companies that seem likely to dominate in those areas. Keep in mind, though, that this strategy won't always work out as you might hope, and that it can be safer and also powerful to just stick to low-fee, broad-market index funds. They can make you a millionaire, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is growing more prevalent quickly these days, and many investors reasonably wonder where they might invest in order to capitalize on AI. Here are 10 stocks to consider. Each is playing a significant role in the world of AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n10 artificial intelligence stocks that could make you a millionaire\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nMost investors have heard of semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by now and either own it or wish they did. Originally known for gaming chips, now it's not only a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for games but also in chips for data centers. That bodes well for Nvidia's future, as data centers are booming, with much of our AI activity running through them. Nvidia recently carried a market value topping $2.5 trillion -- and that's after a 24% drop from its 52-week high!\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), parent of Facebook and Instagram, among other platforms, is another player in the AI arena, spending billions on AI research and incorporating AI into many of its offerings. The company has also raised eyebrows by making its Llama AI model open-source.\n\n3. Dell Technologies\n\nYou may not think of hardware specialist Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) as an AI company, but remember that the proliferation of AI has meant the proliferation of servers and storage systems -- which Dell supplies. The company has reported robust growth in its AI-related sales.\n\n4. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is being added to the S&P 500, and for good reason, as it has grown into a specialist in AI software with a recent market value topping $67 billion. It began with a focus on serving governmental customers but has been expanding into the commercial realm.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is a semiconductor specialist offering wireless, optical, and AI processing chips, among other things. Its AI business is doing quite well, as revenue from AI-focused optical and networking chips jumped 280% in the second quarter, hitting $3.1 billion. Some expect it to profit handsomely from custom AI chips, as well.\n\nStory continues\n\n6. Micron Technology\n\nJust as the boom in AI requires lots of servers and data centers, it also requires a lot of memory, which is where memory specialist Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) comes in. Micron is a cyclical stock, so expect it to go up and down along with the economy.\n\n7. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is involved in all kinds of technologies, from its widely used Office productivity software to its Azure cloud computing platform to the Xbox gaming platform and the Windows operating system, among others. Microsoft has also invested billions in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and it has been incorporating AI into many of its offerings.\n\n8. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is a chipmaker that supplies many chips inside smartphones -- not to mention cars and even household appliances. It's been developing AI-focused chips recently and it's poised to benefit as more AI computing starts being done within devices instead of in the cloud.\n\n9. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet dominates the search world with its Google engine, and it has been incorporating AI into Google successfully -- without having to outsource its AI technology. Better still, unlike many of the other companies in this list, Alphabet's stock seems attractively valued at recent levels, with its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.4 well below its five-year average of 23.6.\n\n10. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is an AI chip maker, and it's getting into the server business, as well, with a recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems.\n\nThese are just 10 of many solid AI-related and AI-focused companies out there.\n\nArtificial intelligence stocks in perspective\n\nYou might be wondering why I listed 10 stocks instead of the best one or two. Well, it's because I don't know which AI-involved stocks will end up dominant in the future. It's easy to guess, and the companies above certainly stand to prosper from AI, but no one really knows how things will play out. Also, these stocks are often not cheap, including many of the ones above.\n\nGiven that, you might consider favoring a fund of AI stocks. Or just a fund focused on technology stocks, as that would invariably have a lot of exposure to AI. That's a good way to avoid missing out on most of tomorrow's big winners. Some possibilities with terrific track records:\n\nETF Expense Ratio 5-Year Avg. Annual Return 10-Year Avg. Annual Return 15-Year Avg. Annual Return VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 0.35% 31.46% 25.47% 22.33% iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) 0.35% 25.82% 23.25% 20.89% Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) 0.09% 21.91% 19.47% 18.58% Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) 0.10% 21.12% 19.65% 18.82%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of Sept. 6, 2024.\n\nIf you know a lot about AI, you might do well investing in the stocks you think will be the best long-term performers. If not, consider buying a basket of AI companies, either individually or via a fund. You can ride the AI boom to millionaire status choosing any of these routes.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 755% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 165% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 16, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

After filing the paperwork, he flashed a thumbs up across the room at an operative he knew only as “Johnny.”\n\nSeveral other unorthodox candidates have emerged across the country—all backed by the same shadowy group, the Patriots Run Project.\n\nFor the past year, the group has recruited Trump supporters to run as independent candidates in key swing districts where they could siphon votes from Republicans in races that will help determine which party controls the House next year, an Associated Press review has found. In addition to two races in Iowa, the group recruited candidates in Nebraska, Montana, Virginia and Minnesota. All six recruits described themselves as retired, disabled—or both.\n\nThe group's operation provides few clues about its management, financing or motivation. But interviews, text messages, emails, business filings and other documents reviewed by the AP show that a significant sum has been spent—and some of it traces back to Democratic consulting firms.\n\nWhile dirty tricks are as old as American elections, the efforts this year could have profound consequences in the fight to control Congress, which is expected to be decided by a handful of races. It's also not an isolated example: Allies of Trump have been working across the U.S. to get liberal academic Cornel West on the ballot in hopes he could play spoiler in the presidential election.\n\n“At that time I was thinking, well, it would be nice to be in Congress and get to work with President Trump,” Wiederien, 54, reflected in an interview outside the Veterans Affairs hospital in Des Moines, where he was seeking treatment for a leaking incision on his head from previous brain surgery. “It looks like it’s a dirty trick now.”\n\nWiederien withdrew his candidacy last month after he says it became clear he'd been manipulated into running against Nunn. Now he wants an investigation to uncover the motives of those who made his candidacy possible.\n\nA deceptive recruitment drive on Facebook\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with other recruits, his story begins with Facebook, where the Patriots Run Project operated a series of pro-Trump pages and ran ads that used apocalyptic rhetoric to attack establishment politicians in both parties while urging conservatives to run in November.\n\n“We need American Patriots like YOU to stand for freedom with President Trump and take back control from the globalist elites by running for office,” one such ad states.\n\nSome candidates say they were contacted because of their political posts on Facebook. Two others said the group reached out after they completed an online survey.\n\nOnce recruited, they communicated with a handful of operatives through text messages, emails and phone calls. In-person contact was limited. Run Patriots Project advised them about what forms to fill out and how to file required paperwork.\n\nIn at least three races, petition signatures to qualify for the ballot were circulated by a Nevada company that works closely with the Democratic consulting firm Sole Strategies, according to documents, including text messages and a draft contract, as well as the firm's co-founder. In Iowa, a different Democratic firm conducted a poll testing attacks on Nunn, while presenting Wiederien as the true conservative.\n\nDespite the ties to Democratic firms, there is a scant paper trail to determine who is overseeing the effort.\n\nPatriots Run Project is not a registered business in the United States and it is not listed as a nonprofit with the IRS. It has not filed paperwork to form a political committee with the Federal Election Commission. The only concrete identifying detail listed on the group's website is a P.O. Box inside a UPS store in Washington, D.C.\n\nMessages left at email addresses and phone numbers for the group’s operatives went unanswered.\n\nA spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats' campaign arm, said the organization had no knowledge of or involvement in the effort. House Majority PAC, the Democrats' big spending congressional super PAC, was also not involved, a spokesman said.\n\nJason Torchinsky, a prominent Republican election lawyer and former Justice Department official, said investigators should take interest. “Given what is described, there could be a wide variety of federal and state criminal violations,” he said.\n\nRick Hasen, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, said the effort “looks shady and unethical,” but added “it is hard to say whether any laws have been broken, which would depend not only on the facts, but also the statutes and precedents under state law.”\n\nIn Iowa, it is a crime to deprive or defraud voters of “a fair and impartially conducted election process,\" while in Virginia ”conspiracy against rights of citizens\" is a felony.\n\nIt's not the first time Patriots Run Project has drawn attention.\n\nIn June, the Center for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based watchdog, issued a report that found the network of Patriots Run Project pages on Facebook were likely controlled by a small number of people, deceiving users and violating Facebook’s policies on “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The ads also violated the site's standards because they did not include disclaimers showing who was responsible.\n\nFacebook took down the pages. But by then, the mystery operatives running the group were already working to get recruits on ballots.\n\nMeta, Facebook's parent company, didn't respond to a request for comment. The company reported receiving $48,000 for the group's ads.\n\n‘They got me on the ballot’\n\nUnlike Wiederien, other candidates said they believed the group had done nothing wrong.\n\nThomas Bowman, 71 and disabled after a kidney transplant, said he believes he likely was recruited to run against Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota to split the conservative vote and help Craig win reelection in the suburban Minneapolis district. But the self-described constitutional conservative expressed gratitude for free help getting signatures.\n\n“They got me on the ballot,” Bowman said. “If I had to do that all by myself, I couldn’t do it.”\n\nIn Montana, Dennis Hayes was recruited to run as a Libertarian against GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke. The group found a donor to give him $1,740 to cover his candidate filing fee, Hayes recalled. The donor, whom Hayes would not identify, went to Hayes’ bank with him to deposit the check, which Politico previously reported.\n\n“I told them I didn’t have the money to run or I would. They got me a donor so I could run for Congress,” said Hayes, 70.\n\nRobert Reid, a widowed retiree running against Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in southeastern Virginia, said he was contacted by Patriots Run Project after posting his views to Facebook. His sole in-person contact was when a man drove to his home in a Mercedes SUV to drop off his completed petition signature paperwork.\n\n“They seem to be nice people,” said Reid, a Trump supporter who will appear on November’s ballot for the swing district seat. The thought, however, did cross his mind that “these guys want me to run to draw votes away from” Kiggans.\n\nIn Nebraska, Army veteran and Trump supporter Gary Bera said he was asked to run as an independent against Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who is facing a challenge. The district, which includes Omaha, is the state's most competitive.\n\nBera was a truck driver and engineering draftsman before disability forced him from work. After he was recruited through an online survey, Bera said the group instructed him to open a business checking account, a requirement for declaring a federal candidacy. Because his car wouldn’t run, an operative agreed to pick him up to file paperwork with the state.\n\nBut plans changed abruptly last month when he was informed that the group had not collected enough signatures for him to qualify. “Now I’m putzing around,” Bera said.\n\nIn Iowa, the group recruited longtime GOP activist Stephanie Jones to run as an independent against Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, even though Jones does not live in that eastern Iowa district. Jones said the group paid to gather signatures for her but fell short.\n\nJones, a Trump supporter who is on disability due to post-traumatic stress disorder, then unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination with an operative's encouragement. She said she believes those behind the effort are genuine but desire anonymity because “they don’t want to be targets of the deep state.”\n\nOperatives target a key race in Iowa\n\nWiederien, however, thinks the group had ulterior motives. The Iowa district he was recruited to run in has been fiercely contested in recent years. Nunn won by roughly 2,000 votes in 2022, while the Democrat who held the seat, Cindy Axne, eked out victories in two prior races that drew third-party candidates.\n\nThe Patriots Run Project identified Wiederien through Facebook last fall, and an operative calling himself “Knox” urged him to run: “God bless you. You’re a true patriot. We are gonna save our country!”\n\nWiederien, who has a collection of Trump merchandise and attended several Trump rallies, had text and phone conversations over the ensuing months with operatives who identified themselves as “Will Haywood” and “Johnny Shearer.”\n\nThe AP was unable to confirm whether Haywood and Shearer were real identities. A John Shearer who Wiederien said was involved said he could not confirm or deny that. “If I were in this covert political organization I wouldn’t really admit to it, would I?” he said.\n\nThe operatives convinced Wiederien to change his party affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated so he could qualify. They assured him his 2013 felony conviction for his third operating while intoxicated offense, which cost him his right to vote and run for office until 2016, wasn’t disqualifying.\n\nThey urged him to list his affiliation on the ballot as “America First.\" They arranged for a firm to gather signatures across the district, which includes Des Moines, its suburbs and rural southern Iowa.\n\nThose signatures were gathered by Common Sense America, a Nevada limited liability company created in February. A company disclosure filing in Colorado, which requires signature gatherers to register, lists a phone number for a co-founder of the Democratic consulting firm, Sole Strategies.\n\n“We work very closely with Common Sense America,” Zee Cohen-Sanchez, the co-founder, said when contacted. Lisa Cohen, the registered agent for Common Sense America who appears to be Cohen-Sanchez's mother, didn’t return messages.\n\nSole Strategies has earned nearly $1.8 million over the past four years working primarily for Democratic candidates and causes, including numerous Democratic House members and candidates, records show. Jones said Common Sense America gathered signatures for her campaign.\n\nA draft contract shows the firm was set to receive $3,300 for collecting signatures for Bera in Nebraska. A philanthropist listed on the document as the proposed buyer of those services is Carolyn Cohen of Nyack, New York, a registered Democrat who has a history of supporting liberal causes. “She doesn’t comment on her political donations,” her partner, Larry Miller, said.\n\nLast month, a poll attacked Nunn as soft in his opposition to abortion, terrorists and Democrats — calling him “an errand boy for the uniparty elite”— while painting Wiederien as the pro-Trump conservative in the race.\n\nA spokeswoman for the firm that operated the poll, Dynata, said that its customer was Patinkin Research, which says it “has worked to elect dozens of Democratic candidates.” The spokeswoman later said she identified Patinkin in error and urged AP not to publish its identity. Patinkin’s founder didn’t return messages.\n\nWhen it was time to submit his petitions, Wiederien said “Johnny” agreed to drive him the 75 miles to Des Moines and arrived in an electric car. The car needed to be charged before they could make the trek, so Wiederien said he entertained the operative with video clips of Trump while they waited.\n\nLater, he said they met a man wearing a suit in an office near the Iowa Capitol who gave them paperwork and a binder full of his signatures. All Wiederien had to do was sign a form.\n\nWiederien’s statement of candidacy was notarized by a Des Moines paralegal whose firm has done some campaign-related work for Democrats. Firm representatives didn’t return messages.\n\nWiederien said he found it suspicious “Johnny” appeared to avoid a Capitol surveillance camera and declined to have his picture taken with him. Afterward, the group paid for an Uber to drive Wiederien home.\n\nSoon, he heard from Republicans who convinced him he’d been tricked into thinking the Patriots Run Project had Trump’s support and withdrew his name from the ballot.\n\n___\n\nSlodysko reported from Washington.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "US regulatory power faces fresh test as new Supreme Court term nears",
        "content": "By John Kruzel\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A case involving the vape industry gives the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to further erode the authority of federal regulatory agencies following other major rulings as the justices gird for a new term featuring important business-related questions.\n\nThe nine-month term, which begins on Oct. 7, also brings cases involving tech giants Nvidia and Meta's Facebook that could make it harder for private plaintiffs to win securities fraud lawsuits against companies in federal courts.\n\nThe vape industry case is the latest front in a regulatory rollback effort in the courts cheered by conservatives and business interests to weaken the federal agency bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements executive action.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a June 28 decision powered by its 6-3 conservative majority, overturned a legal principle called \"Chevron deference\" established by the justices 40 years ago that had called on judges to defer to federal agencies in interpreting laws they administer. That case involved an industry challenge to a U.S. regulatory agency's fish conservation program.\n\nThe new case does not carry the same high stakes but nonetheless affords the conservative justices an opportunity to scrutinize actions of a regulatory agency, in this case the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's denial of applications to sell flavored vape products.\n\nThe justices in June also issued rulings faulting actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Environmental Protection Agency. Additional cases challenging federal agencies have the potential to reach the justices this term.\n\nThe court will hear the FDA's appeal of a lower court's ruling that the agency failed to follow proper legal procedures under federal law when it denied applications by e-cigarette liquid makers Triton Distribution and Vapetasia to bring their nicotine-containing products to market.\n\nThe companies had filed FDA applications in 2020 for products with flavors such as sour grape, pink lemonade and crème brulee, and names including \"Jimmy The Juice Man Strawberry Astronaut\" and \"Suicide Bunny Bunny Season.\"\n\nAlthough the FDA maintains that it has not categorically banned flavored e-cigarette products, companies seeking its approval must clear a high legal bar because, according to an agency court filing, such products pose a \"known and substantial risk to youth.\" The FDA has approved only 27 e-cigarette products - all tobacco or menthol flavored - while denying more than a million other applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The FDA case is another attack on agency authority and power, so it seems a bit in keeping with the seminal cases from last term that stripped agencies of various powers or left them more open to attack,\" said Karen Woody, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Virginia.\n\nThe court has not yet set a date for arguments in the case.\n\nSECURITIES FRAUD CASES\n\nThe justices will hear separate bids by Facebook and Nvidia to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits. The Supreme Court already has weakened the federal agency that polices securities fraud - the Securities and Exchange Commission. These new cases now could make it more difficult for private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud.\n\n\"These cases represent new opportunities for the Supreme Court to narrow the pinhole - so even fewer federal fraud claims can proceed past the early stages - or widen it,\" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School in Louisiana.\n\nFacebook and Nvidia filed separate appeals after a lower court allowed class action securities fraud lawsuits to proceed against them.\n\nThe justices on Nov. 6 are due to hear arguments in Facebook's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties.\n\nThe court is due on Nov. 13 to hear arguments in a similar effort by Nvidia to scuttle litigation accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWoody said the business community should take heed given the weighty stakes. Woody added that she expects the court to rule in favor of the companies in both cases. She joined a court brief favoring Facebook.\n\n\"The Nvidia and Facebook cases read together could end up with companies needing to disclose more information and plaintiffs with a slightly lower bar for pleading requirements in a class action,\" Woody said. \"That combination could have companies worried about a potential increase in liability exposure.\"\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor Benjamin Edwards said the court's momentous term that ended in July continues to reverberate.\n\n\"I suspect the story in the business community for the next few years will be how to adjust\" to the new legal landscape, Edwards added.\n\nAnat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Ohio, said the business community is likely to try to build on its considerable success in recent terms of \"gutting regulatory agencies' ability to create and enforce rules on industry.\"\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms Inc. (META): ‘Stocks Can’t Stabilize Until These Weak Shareholders Sell Out’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there’s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he’s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it’s worth paying attention to what’s going right.\n\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I’m willing to declare that there’s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I’m not trying to call a bottom, let’s make that crystal clear, but I think it’s worth taking a hard look at what’s actually going right—not just what’s going wrong.\"\n\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it’s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn’t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\n\"Sure, the market’s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren’t even oversold yet—at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there’s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don’t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\n\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve’s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let’s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That’s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won’t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it’s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"But let’s be realistic: You can’t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there’s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn’t cut rates when business is booming. That’s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday’s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can’t have it both ways.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost $251 billion in market capitalization on February 3, 2022. However, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has since rebounded significantly, climbing 116%, while the S&P 500 only gained 23% over the same period. Cramer used this example to illustrate that major market dips can lead to substantial future gains for investors who buy in during these downturns.\n\n\"Stocks can’t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. History shows that significant market drops like this tend to offer great buying opportunities. For example, Meta Platforms shed $251 billion in market cap on February 3rd, 2022, but since then, it's rallied 116%, outperforming the S&P's 23% gain over the same period.\"\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is leveraging its vast user base and leading position in digital advertising to achieve substantial growth. In Q2 2024, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported record revenue of $32 billion, a 12% increase from the previous year, driven by robust digital ad sales. Its net income more than doubled to $9.2 billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier, with earnings per share reaching $3.29, surpassing analyst expectations.\n\nThis financial performance is bolstered by a rise in daily active users to 3.07 billion across its platforms. A major factor behind Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s positive outlook is its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made significant strides with AI-powered advertising tools that improve targeting and ad efficiency. Additionally, AI-driven content recommendations on Instagram and Facebook Reels have increased user engagement. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s investment in the metaverse through its Reality Labs division is also a key growth driver, aiming to create an immersive digital environment.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Even Facebook Couldn’t Compete With Google, Ex-Ad Chief Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. entered into a 2018 deal with Google after concluding internally that it couldn’t successfully compete against the search giant, because of its monopoly over the technology undergirding online display advertising, a former Facebook advertising executive testified as part of a US Justice Department antitrust trial.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine' The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads\n\nBrian Boland, who headed Facebook’s advertising technology between 2009 and 2019, told a Virginia federal court that the social network initially aimed to directly challenge Google in the market for display ads sold on websites. The Facebook Audience Network sought to allow marketers to run ads on the company’s social networks, Facebook and Instagram, as well as buy them on websites and in apps.\n\nBut by 2017, Facebook had concluded that it would struggle to effectively compete against Alphabet Inc.’s Google because of its “monopoly” and the advantages the search giant gives itself within its advertising tools.\n\n“Google sits between us and the impressions we want to buy,” a July 2017 strategy memo about the Facebook Audience Network said. Google’s tools give it “the opportunity to cherry pick the best supply.”\n\n“Knowing there would be a layer between us” and advertisers “was a concern,” Boland told Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide on the Justice Department’s allegations that Google illegally monopolized advertising technology markets. Google’s advertising exchange gave it a so-called “last look” in online auctions, allowing the company to decide after an ad was auctioned off that it wanted to buy it.\n\nBoland likened the technique to Google being able to select the 30 best apples from a crate before anyone else got the chance to buy.\n\n“You’re left with the leftovers,” Boland said.\n\nBoland oversaw six months of negotiations between Facebook — whose corporate name was changed to Meta Platforms in 2021 — and Google for a deal that was eventually signed in 2018. The agreement, internally nicknamed Jedi Blue, gave Facebook preferential treatment when bidding through Google’s exchange for web or mobile app ads within its Facebook Audience Network.\n\nThe pact between Google and Facebook, the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the online advertising market, was approved at the highest levels of both companies, with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Google chief Sundar Pichai personally signing off.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe details of the Facebook-Google deal, officially named the “Network Bidding Agreement,” weren’t revealed in Friday’s court testimony. But documents shown in court said that Google was “looking for Facebook to pay 15% of working media cost in order to remove” the last look advantage.\n\nA group of state attorneys general, who sued Google in 2020 over alleged monopolization of the ad tech market, initially said that the companies’ agreement violated the antitrust law. They alleged that Google offered the deal to Facebook in exchange for the social media company abandoning plans to adopt a new type of technology, known as header bidding, that would have undercut Google’s monopoly.\n\nA judge in New York threw out those allegations, saying “there is nothing inexplicable or suspicious” about what led the companies to enter into the agreement. European antitrust enforcers, who also looked into the deal, closed their investigation into it in March 2022 without taking any action.\n\nWhen the Justice Department sued Google last year for monopolizing the advertising technology market, they didn’t allege the agreement was anticompetitive, instead highlighting that even a tech giant of Meta’s size couldn’t compete.\n\nBoland, who left Facebook in 2020, said he expressed concern internally about the Facebook network’s lack of growth in online display advertising. The project eventually stopped buying display ads on the web, instead shifting its focus entirely to mobile ads.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Vegas Sphere’s First Live Sporting Event Will Be an Expensive One China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Facebook and Instagram parent firm Meta has said it will soon begin training its AI models using public posts to the social media sites from UK adults.\n\nThe US tech giant said it would begin the process in the coming months after positive discussions with the UK’s data protection regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).\n\nAI at Meta tools have not yet launched in the UK or EU because of previously raised regulator concerns about the plans, and the tech giant and the EU remain in deadlock on the issue.\n\nWe’re pleased to announce that, after taking onboard regulatory feedback, we will begin training our AI at Meta models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK and Brazil.\n\n— Nick Clegg (@nickclegg) September 13, 2024\n\nBut Meta said it had “engaged positively” with the ICO and said that the regulator had now given the scheme the green light.\n\n“This clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner,” Meta said in a blog post.\n\n“We welcome the ICO’s guidance supporting Meta’s implementation of the legal basis of ‘Legitimate Interests’, which can be a valid legal basis for using certain first party data to train generative AI models for our AI at Meta features and experiences.”\n\nThe social media giant said it would not use people’s private messages with friends and family to train AI at Meta models, and that it does not use information from accounts of those in the UK under the age of 18.\n\nIt said it would use public information – public posts, comments, public photos and captions – from the accounts of adult users on Instagram and Facebook to “improve generative AI models for out AI at Meta features and experiences”.\n\nThe company said that from next week, UK users on the two platforms would start to receive in-app notifications to explain the scheme, as well as guidance on how to access an objection form where they can opt out from their data being used to train the firm’s AI models.\n\nMeta added that it had also incorporated feedback from the ICO to make its objection form “simpler, more prominent and easier to find”.\n\nStephen Almond, executive director regulatory risk at the ICO, said it would “monitor the situation” in the coming weeks.\n\nHe added: “We have been clear that any organisation using its users’ information to train generative AI models to be transparent about how people’s data is being used.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Organisations should put effective safeguards in place before they start using personal data for model training, including providing a clear and simple route for users to object to the processing. The ICO has not provided regulatory approval for the processing and it is for Meta to ensure and demonstrate ongoing compliance.”\n\nFormer deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg, now president of global affairs at the tech giant said the company was “pleased” to launch the scheme in the UK as well as Brazil.\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, he said: “This is good news for innovation in both countries – it means we can bring our AI at Meta products to both the UK and Brazil much sooner, and that our generative AI models will understand local culture, history and idiom.\n\n“Unfortunately, our plans to train our AI models to understand the EU’s rich cultural, social and historical contributions remain paused while EU regulators remain unable to agree how the law should be applied.”",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms will begin training its AI models using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram in the UK over the coming months, the company said, after it had paused the training in the region following a regulatory backlash.\n\nThe company will use public posts including photos, captions and comments to train its generative artificial intelligence models, it said on Friday, adding that the training content will not include private messages or information from accounts of users under the age of 18.\n\nThe update follows Meta's decision in mid-June to pause the launch of its AI models in Europe after the Irish privacy regulator told the company to delay its plan to harness data from social media posts.\n\nThe company had then said the delay would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).\n\n\"Since we paused training our generative AI models in the UK to address regulatory feedback, we've engaged positively with the ICO ... this clarity and certainty will help us bring AI at Meta products to the UK much sooner,\" Meta said on Friday.\n\nFacebook and Instagram users in the UK will start receiving in-app notifications from next week explaining the company's procedure and how users can object to their data being used for the training, Meta added.\n\nIn June, the company's plans faced backlash from advocacy group NOYB, which urged national privacy watchdogs across Europe to stop such use of social media content, saying the notifications were insufficient to meet EU's stringent EU privacy and transparency rules.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

its highest level since 2008 - as it battled to bring down inflation which surged to a peak of 11.1pc in October 2022.\n\nHowever, inflation has fallen back to 2.2pc, in line with the Bank’s 2pc target, and Goldman said there are “compelling reasons” why rate setters on the Monetary Policy Committee will increase the pace of cuts, which began with a drop to 5pc last month.\n\nMoney markets traders are betting that the Bank will reduce rates to about 3.5pc by August next year.\n\nHowever, Goldman said that wage growth “will cool meaningfully in coming months”, which will help lower services inflation, which has long been a source of worry for the Bank.\n\nIt expects services inflation to decelerate to 5pc by the end of the year, which is 0.3 percentage points below the Bank of England’s August forecast, before falling to 3.8pc by the end of 2025.\n\nGoldman Sachs said policymakers would also likely pick up the pace of rate cuts as other central banks around the world reduce borrowing costs more quickly.\n\nAnalyst Sven Jari Stehn said: “A continued quarterly pace through 2025 would make the Bank of England a significant outlier relative to other advanced economies, which is historically unusual.”\n\n10:51 AM BST\n\nHouseholds expect interest rates to fall\n\nThe British public expect interest rates to fall, a Bank of England survey shows, marking the first time the nation has widely expected borrowing costs to fall since the global financial crisis.\n\nThe quarterly Inflation Attitudes Survey found 38oc of respondents expect rates to come down in the next 12 months while 29pc anticipate a rise.\n\nIt was the first time that the public has on balance expected borrowing costs to ease since November 2008, when Britain was and the world was in the depths of the global financial crisis.\n\n10:34 AM BST\n\nPublic satisfaction in Bank of England improves\n\nThe public’s confidence in the Bank of England to bring down inflation turned positive for the first time in two years, a month after policymakers began cutting interest rates.\n\nThe Bank’s latest inflation attitudes survey found that its approval rating reached 4pc last month, compared to minus 4pc in May.\n\nIt was the Bank’s first positive figure since February 2022, when inflation had risen to 6.2pc.\n\n10:15 AM BST\n\nPound rises amid speculation on interest rate cuts\n\nThe pound has jumped against the dollar amid renewed speculation that the US Federal Reserve could opt for a jumbo interest rate cut next week after all.\n\nSterling was up 0.1pc versus the dollar to $1.314 following a 0.7pc gain on Thursday.\n\nIt rallied after articles in the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal said Fed policymakers consider it “a close call” between a smaller quarter of a percentage point interest rate cut or a bigger move by half a percentage point.\n\nAs a result, traders raised the chances of a half-point cut from the Fed next week to 41pc, from closer to 14pc a day ago.\n\nThe pound was flat against the euro, which is worth 84.4p.\n\n09:56 AM BST\n\nPwC fined and banned from China over Evergrande audit\n\nPwC has been fined 441m yuan (£47.3m) and banned from operating in China for six months over its auditing of the collapsed property giant Evergrande.\n\nIn its steepest penalty against a Big Four accounting firm, China’s Ministry of Finance imposed a six-month business suspension on PwC’s auditing unit.\n\nIt also imposed a fine of 116m yuan (£12.4m) on PwC Zhong Tian LLP, the registered accounting entity and the main onshore arm of PwC in China.\n\nChina’s securities regulator said in a separate statement that it confiscated the unit’s revenue involved in the Evergrande case totalling 27.7m yuan and fined the unit 297m yuan.\n\nEvergrande has struggled to repay creditors for years and became the symbol of China’s massive property crisis after defaulting in 2021.\n\nIt became subject to a winding-up order handed down by a Hong Kong court earlier this year.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Recent Stock Performance Looks Decent- Can Strong Fundamentals Be the Reason?",
        "content": "Most readers would already know that Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) stock increased by 4.3% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n33% = US$51b ÷ US$157b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nMeta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 33% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Meta Platforms has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.1% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Meta Platforms over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is META worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether META is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Meta Platforms Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nMeta Platforms has a low three-year median payout ratio of 3.9%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\n\nWhile Meta Platforms has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.1% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Meta Platforms' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

However, the fact that both have appeared in multiple stock acronyms over the years (remember FANG and FAAMG?) and are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven makes this comparison worthwhile.\n\nMeta Platforms owns several social media properties, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the company has been attempting to reinvent itself into a metaverse company in recent years, touting the metaverse as “the future of digital connection.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet owns the Google search engine and many other properties. Thus, the company rakes in revenue from app sales via Google Play, purchases on YouTube, cloud services fees, online advertising, licensing, and even hardware like its Chromebooks and the Nest thermostat.\n\nIn terms of share price, Meta Platforms stock has surged 48% year-to-date and is up 72% over the last 12 months, although it is up only 4% for the last three months. In contrast, Alphabet stock is up a mere 8% year-to-date, accounting for nearly all of its 11% one-year return. Alphabet’s lackluster year-to-date and one-year gains can be attributed to the shares’ 14% tumble over the last three months.\n\nDespite such a dramatic difference in their recent share-price performances, the gap between Meta’s and Alphabet’s valuations is not significant. However, the two companies don’t address exactly the same industries. Thus, we compare each company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to their own histories to gauge their valuations over time and determine which is the better Big Tech play.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAt a P/E of 25.9x, Meta Platforms is trading at a small premium to Alphabet. However, the stock is on a steady downtrend on a P/E basis, although it’s trading much closer to its 52-week high than its 52-week low. Nonetheless, the multiple compression grants Meta Platforms a long-term bullish view.\n\nMeta Platforms has certainly had its share of trouble since transitioning into a metaverse company. However, it’s still raking in the revenue on its social media properties, notching $39.1 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 22% year-over-year.\n\nAt the same time, Meta Platforms is developing artificial intelligence technology, aiming to build a nice in generative AI and develop the AI applications that will be used by the masses for years to come. Most importantly, Meta is using AI to guide targeting for its digital advertising and recommendations on its social networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these efforts, estimates suggest that Meta’s AI initiatives may contribute only minimally to its revenue.\n\nHowever, analyst Deepak Mathivanan of Cantor highlighted Meta Platforms as a “top pick” among internet stocks. While he acknowledged the limited revenue impact of AI efforts, he also pointed to the company’s forward valuation. In fact, his estimates suggest a forward P/E of 20x FY25E earnings per share, which he said already embeds AI skepticism and provides room for potential upside for the shares.\n\nThus, I fully agree with this analyst’s assessment, especially due to the current multiple compression we’ve been seeing in Meta’s P/E ratio. The recent peak of about 39x came in July 2023, and the company’s P/E has been on a broader downtrend since then — despite its rising share price.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $584.82, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies an upside potential of 11.27%.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nAlphabet\n\nAt a P/E of 21.5x, Alphabet has a slight advantage over Meta in terms of valuation. In fact, Alphabet hasn’t been this cheap on a P/E basis since March 2023. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate.\n\nPut simply, Alphabet just looks too cheap to ignore at current levels. In fact, even excluding the cheapness of Alphabet’s P/E, the stock hasn’t been this cheap on a per-share level since March, indicating a buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock is slipping dangerously close to oversold territory with its Relative Strength Index of 32.5. As such, anything below 30 puts the stock in oversold territory and suggests an upside correction could be around the corner.\n\nFinally, Alphabet’s 52-week range of about $120 to $192 is far less dramatic than Meta’s range of $279 to $544, indicating greater stability in Alphabet shares. In a market with significant volatility, investors could certainly do with holding some stable and steadily growing shares in their portfolios.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlphabet has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $203, the average Alphabet stock price target implies an upside potential of 35.27%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Bullish on Meta Platforms and Alphabet\n\nUltimately, neither Meta Platforms nor Alphabet will be going anywhere anytime soon. Thus, both look like long-term buy-and-hold positions with a permanent place in a long-term portfolio. However, Alphabet is offering a distinct buy-the-dip opportunity right now because it’s too cheap to ignore. There hasn’t been a better time to buy this stock in months, if not more than a year based on P/E.\n\nIn contrast, Meta’s year-to-date gain makes its shares less attractive in the near term. Nonetheless, even at the current per-share price, investors are unlikely to lose money if they buy and hold for the long term.\n\nHence, both stocks receive bullish ratings, although Alphabet emerges as the clear winner.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Cashed Out Of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) In Favor of Other AI Stocks",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn’t mean he’d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang’s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.\n\nBack in May, Druckenmiller explained why he’s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he’s had a “hell of a run” and he now “just needs a break.”\n\nHowever, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could “rhythm” with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the “incremental payoff” of AI investments is coming by the “day.”\n\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Stake Value: Completely Sold\n\nGMO’s Tom Hancock recently talked about quality stocks in the big tech space and said he’s focusing on stocks that can get a decent rate of return with growth on their investments. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is among the holdings of GMO US Quality ETF (NYSEARCA:QLTY) which is up about 20% so far this year.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Elon Musk has become increasingly vocal about US politics on X (formerly Twitter) since acquiring it in 2022 - Jean Catuffe/GC Images\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk has turned Twitter into a “hyper-partisan ideological hobby horse”, former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg has said.\n\nSir Nick, who is now head of global affairs for Facebook-owner Meta, said Mr Musk’s platform, which is now known as X, was used by a tiny group of elite people to “yell at each other” about politics.\n\nBy contrast, Facebook and Instagram had deprioritised news and politics because people did not want to read it, he said.\n\n“While of course X has moved under Elon Musk into a one-man hyper-partisan hobby horse, we’ve got four billion people around the world using our services … they don’t really want to use our services to yell at each other about the latest headlines,” Sir Nick said at an event in London.\n\n“X is tiny, it’s not used by the vast majority of people around the world, it’s a tiny, elite, news obsessed, politics obsessed app.”\n\nBy contrast, Sir Nick said Meta had steadily reduced the amount of news and politics material shown in people’s Facebook and Instagram feed, and that users did not want to see it.\n\n“What we keep hearing from our users over and over again is ‘can you just get politics out of my feed, I don’t want it’. The total amount of politics and current affairs on our services now as a proportion of the total is less than 3pc.” Sir Nick says the role of social media in users’ political decision making isn’t as significant as many believe - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nSir Nick was leader of the Liberal Democrats until 2015 and took the party into coalition with the Tories after the 2010 general election, serving as deputy prime minister.\n\nHe moved to the US shortly after losing his seat in 2017 and joined Meta as president of public affairs.\n\nMeta launched a rival service last year called Threads, but has said it will promote subjects such as sports above news and politics in feeds.\n\nSir Nick, who will next week face a Senate committee about tech companies’ role in elections, said that social media has very little impact on voters’ choices.\n\n“People tend to somewhat exaggerate the role that technology plays in how people vote and political behaviour,” he said.\n\nHe also claimed that artificial intelligence had made little impact on elections this year despite widespread warnings that technologies such as deepfakes will manipulate voters.\n\n“It is striking how little effect AI’s had at a systemic level … I don’t think anyone has identified that AI has played a systemic role in any elections,” Sir Nick said.\n\nThe former Lib Dem leader and deputy prime minister also said that parents were not using the tools the company had built to keep their children safe online.\n\nIn response to Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese saying he wanted to set a minimum age for children to use social media, he said: “We’ve introduced around 50 tools to give parents more control… and guess what, even when we build these controls parents don’t use them.”\n\nSir Nick said the company planned to introduce more safety controls for children soon.",

        "title": "Australian lawmakers force Meta to admit only regulation will force it to offer AI training opt-out",
        "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In today’s edition…Meta admits only regulation will stop it from scraping user data to train its AI products; AI models get more multimodal (and more emotional); big tech splurges big on AI equipment.\n\nDuring a government inquiry earlier this week in Australia, Meta's global privacy director Melinda Claybaugh admitted that the company scraped the public photos and posts of every Australian adult user to train its AI models without providing an option to opt out—because it can. More specifically, because regulators haven’t stopped it from doing so.\n\nAccording to the Australian Broadcasting Company, Claybaugh initially denied the scraping of user data for AI models, explicitly stating “we have not done that” when a senator asked whether Meta used posts from Australian users going back as far back as 2007 to train its AI products. After being pressed, she said that yes, in fact, the company has done that.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007, unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private. That's the reality, isn't it?” another senator asked.\n\n\"Correct,” replied Claybaugh.\n\nMeta equates 'public' profiles and posts with consent to train AI\n\nClaybaugh went on to make clear that the company has not scraped data from users under 18, but she could not answer about the fate of posts from users who are now adults but opened their accounts when they were under 18. She also said that public photos of children posted by adults would have been scrapped. Additionally, she said that a user setting their account to private to prevent future scraping would not allow them to regain privacy over what’s already been used.\n\nOne could argue that these posts are public and open for the taking, but there’s a world of difference between allowing a profile to be public so users can interact with you and giving a trillion-dollar company unfettered permission to take your content and use it to build commercial AI products as it wishes. Yes, Meta may have legally gotten permission by putting its right to do so in its terms and conditions, but that is not anything near explicit or real consent. Overall, it’s a bleak picture of user privacy.\n\nMeta having questionable data practices is not exactly new—and it’s already been known that the company is training its models on user data. What struck me as interesting about this, however, was the part of the conversation that unfolded about why Australians were not offered an option to opt out.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta says EU regulation means EU users get unique opt-out\n\nAfter being questioned about why Australian users don’t have the option to opt out as users in the EU do, Claybaugh cited the Union’s strict data laws.\n\n\"In Europe there is an ongoing legal question around what is the interpretation of existing privacy law with respect to AI training. We have paused launching our AI products in Europe while there is a lack of certainty. So you are correct that we are offering an opt-out to users in Europe. I will say that the ongoing conversation in Europe is the direct result of the existing regulatory landscape,” she said, referring to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That law has created obstacles for Meta’s plans to train on EU user data and also caused the company in June to announce it was pausing plans to roll out its AI models to EU users.\n\nBasically, Claybaugh admitted that Meta will only take a privacy-first approach if regulators force its hand. In response to a request for comment about not offering an opt-out option in all jurisdictions, a Meta spokesperson further made clear that users are at the whim of their local regulators. “While we don’t currently have an opt-out feature, we’ve built in-platform tools that allow people to delete their personal information from chats with Meta AI across our apps. Depending on where people live, they can also object to the use of their personal information being used to build and train AI consistent with local privacy laws,” the spokesperson told Eye on AI.\n\nWhy not mandate opt-in rather than opt-out?\n\nMany would argue that the entire discussion is misguided and that the process should be entirely opt-in. And, overall, the saga highlights the importance of both data privacy and AI regulations.\n\nCritics of regulating AI often argue that doing so would inadvertently hurt smaller AI startups, handing dominance to the big tech players. But those big tech players already dominate–and they use their access to massive amounts of user data to continue to advance their position. Regulation around data privacy might actually give smaller companies a fighting chance, especially if they found a less ethically challenged way to collect data.\n\nWhat’s more, Meta’s comments underline the urgent role regulators have in protecting consumers amid AI’s rapid proliferation.\n\nAnd with that, here’s more AI news.\n\nSage Lazzaro\r\nsage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.com\r\nsagelazzaro.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Large Employers Building Affordable Housing For Workers: Wave Of The Future?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIt is widely believed that the U.S. has a housing shortage, although the extent varies by location. Zillow.com says the U.S. has a shortage of 4.5 million homes, which has grown by 6% over the last year.\n\nOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow, noted that the lack of affordable private homes pushes up rental prices as demand for renting grows. The basic problem is that more families are created annually than housing units.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nThe Biden Administration has proposed tax incentives for homebuilders to build over two million new homes. In his State of the Union address, Joe Biden also proposed a new tax credit providing $10,000 to first-time homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the fine print indicates the tax credit isn't as significant as it sounds. The credit is only $5,000 per year for two years. For someone in the 22% tax bracket, the savings would only be $1,100 each year. Another problem is the credit given in the year after the home closes. So, the credit does not help prospective buyers with a down payment, closing costs, moving expenses, or commission after the NAR lawsuit.\n\nOne new solution for the housing shortage has emerged from large employers building affordable \"workforce housing\" for their employees. Several large tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are building towns with rental homes to attract employees. Google also offers a housing stipend and relocation bonus to help with relocation and housing expenses. Meta has a similar housing assistance program for some employees.\n\nTesla has built a town called Snailbrook near Austin, TX, with over 100 rental homes. Rents start as low as $800 per month. The town includes a pool, gym, outdoor sports area and a Montessori school for a small number of students.\n\nSome of Florida's largest employers are also getting on board with workforce building. In Tampa, General Hospital has proposed a $60 million apartment complex that will eventually offer below-market rents to its employees. The 160-unit apartment complex has already received $2 million from the county and $10 million from the state. Workers who earn between 80% and 120% of the area's median income (AMI) will qualify to live in the units.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe concept is a win-win for both employers and employees. Workers benefit from having low-cost housing available in areas where rents are normally much higher, and employers benefit by being able to recruit and retain employees who otherwise might decide to move to less expensive cities or states.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

The Public Schools are working with Miami-Dade's Public Housing and Community Development Department to build affordable apartments for teachers and other school district employees who earn less than 80% of the median income in that area.\n\nJackson Health System wants to replace an old office building on the Jackson Memorial Medical Center campus with new apartments conveniently located next to the Metrorail. The project would also include a child care center and improve the Metrorail station to encourage the use of mass transit. At least 50% of the units would be reserved for workers who earn between 60% and 120% of the median income for that area.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is another large Florida employer that has decided to provide its workers with affordable housing. It's developing an 80-acre housing project near its Walt Disney World park in Orlando. Disney wants to build up to 1,400 apartment units, with over 1,000 reserved as affordable units. Most units will be for families in the 80% AMI range or approximately $50,000 to $90,000. The expected completion date is 2026.\n\nHowever, as is often the case, Disney has received pushback from area residents who felt the housing development would increase traffic and affect their quality of life. In a meeting in September 2023, Orange County officials received 104 responses against the project and only 17 in favor of it. Yet, the Orange County commissioners approved the housing project by a 4-2 vote this past March.\n\nWhile that worked out for Disney, affordable housing projects have been rejected in other areas of the state, such as St. Johns County, due to increased concerns about being able to handle traffic.\n\nSo, private industry has succeeded in developing one possible solution to the affordable housing problem. This certainly could be the wave of the future, as these workforce communities help alleviate some of the difficulties that companies face in recruiting and retaining employees while giving workers an affordable yet quality place to live. The most difficult part will be finding locations that don't bring about extra problems for residents of the surrounding communities.\n\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Owning Property\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields and you don't have to own property to do it...\n\nThe Arrived Homes investment platform has created a Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

        "content": "We recently published a list of Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that’d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the “iPhone moment” for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the “App Store moment.”\n\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\n\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\n“Annual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.”\n\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Analysts Recommending Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) AI Stock?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nGMO’s Tom Hancock recently talked about quality stocks in the big tech space and said he’s focusing on stocks that can get a decent rate of return with growth on their investments. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is among the holdings of GMO US Quality ETF (NYSEARCA:QLTY) which is up about 20% so far this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\n\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. AI deployments have already started benefiting the fundamentals of the company, evidenced by the strong performance in the ad market in the second quarter of 2024. Investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald has taken note of these developments, recently naming the company among a basket of firms that the advisory considers top picks in the internet sector for 2024, even after accounting for micro and macro level risks in the space on a global scale.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) earned an Overweight rating at Cantor Fitzgerald in a recent research report, where the advisory noted that the firm had plenty of levers to capture share gains as AI deployment could deliver incremental engagement, monetization, and revenue growth over the next 2–3 years. The advisory added that despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names were fairly reasonable and would benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "46% of Nvidia's $30 Billion in Q2 Revenue Came From 4 Mystery Customers",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\n\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's AI chips are the hottest product in Silicon Valley\n\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\n\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\n\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\n\nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period.\n\nCustomer concentration is concerning\n\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total.\n\nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\n\nCustomer Proportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue Customer A 14% Customer B 11% Customer C 11% Customer D 10%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\n\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\n\nWho are Nvidia's mystery customers?\n\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI. Meta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. Alphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half. Tesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software.\n\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\n\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\n\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Australia threatens fines for social media giants enabling misinformation",
        "content": "By Byron Kaye\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia said it will fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for failing to prevent the spread of misinformation online, joining a worldwide push to rein in borderless tech giants but angering free speech advocates.\n\nThe government said it would make tech platforms set codes of conduct governing how they stop dangerous falsehoods spreading, to be approved by a regulator. The regulator would set its own standard if a platform failed to do so, then fine companies for non-compliance.\n\nThe legislation, to be introduced in parliament on Thursday, targets false content that hurts election integrity or public health, calls for denouncing a group or injuring a person, or risks disrupting key infrastructure or emergency services.\n\nThe bill is part of a wide-ranging regulatory crackdown by Australia, where leaders have complained that foreign-domiciled tech platforms are overriding the country's sovereignty, and comes ahead of a federal election due within a year.\n\nAlready Facebook owner Meta has said it may block professional news content if it is forced to pay royalties, while X, formerly Twitter, has removed most content moderation since being bought by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022.\n\n\"Misinformation and disinformation pose a serious threat to the safety and wellbeing of Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy,\" said Communications Minister Michelle Rowland in a statement.\n\n\"Doing nothing and allowing this problem to fester is not an option.\"\n\nAn initial version of the bill was criticised in 2023 for giving the Australian Communications and Media Authority too much power to determine what constituted misinformation and disinformation, the term for intentionally spreading lies.\n\nRowland said the new bill specified the media regulator would not have power to force the takedown of individual pieces of content or user accounts. The new version of the bill protected professional news, artistic and religious content, while it did not protect government-authorised content.\n\nSome four-fifths of Australians wanted the spread of misinformation addressed, the minister said, citing the Australian Media Literary Alliance.\n\nMeta, which counts nearly nine in 10 Australians as Facebook users, declined to comment. Industry body DIGI, of which Meta is a member, said the new regime reinforced an anti-misinformation code it produced in 2022, but many questions remained.\n\nX was not immediately available for comment.\n\nOpposition home affairs spokesman James Paterson said that while he had yet to examine the revised bill, \"Australians' legitimately-held political beliefs should not be censored by either the government, or by foreign social media platforms\".\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Tepper?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.\n\nDavid Tepper’s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\n“I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.”\n\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school — 100 shares of a $2 stock, “but then the whole thing went bankrupt,” he said.\n\n“It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.”\n\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper’s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he’d joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\n\nAccording to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World’s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nTepper’s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it’s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire’s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper’s Stake: $471,445,700\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: 'Everybody is counting on us'",
        "content": "The biggest draw at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference this week?\n\nNvidia (NVDA) cofounder Jensen Huang.\n\nInvestors and journalists lined up more than an hour before the session just to catch a glimpse of one of the world's most sought after CEOs. Huang told the audience though generative AI is still in its early days, it’ll expand beyond data centers.\n\n“Now what’s amazing is, so the first trillion dollars of data centers is going to get accelerated and invented this new type of software called generative AI. Generative AI is not just a tool, it’s a skill,\" Huang told Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"For the first time we’re going to create skills that augment people.”\n\nFollowing Nvidia's brutal selloff last week, Huang's keynote was seen as an opportunity to calm investors nerves.\n\n“The infrastructure players, like ourselves, and all the cloud service providers, put the infrastructure in the cloud so that developers can use these machines to train the models and fine tune the models, guardrail the models,” Huang said. “And the return on that is just fantastic.”\n\nAccording to Huang, for every dollar a cloud service provider spend with Nvidia, it translates to $5 worth of rentals.\n\n“I think the days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,” Huang said. “The idea that every one of our software engineers will essentially have companion digital engineers 24/7 - that’s the future.”\n\nFor example Huang shared that Nvidia has 32,000 employees, who will be supplemented by “hopefully 100x more digital engineers” in the near future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking on stage with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference in San Francisco.\n\nNvidia servers \"look expensive, and it could be a couple of million dollars per rack, but it replaces thousands of nodes,\" Huang said. \"The amazing thing is, the cables of connecting old, general purpose computing systems cost more than replacing all of those and densifying into one rack.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and OpenAI use Nvidia’s GPUs. Despite the tech giant reporting $30 billion in Q2 revenue, its stock fell by more than $200 billion on the same day.\n\nLast week, Nvidia shed another $400 billion in market value following a Bloomberg report that the Department of Justice subpoenaed the company as part of an antitrust investigation. Nvidia denied the report.\n\n“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” the company said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang was not asked about the Bloomberg report on Wednesday. And despite the recent selloff, Nvidia shares are up nearly 150% in the last 12 months.\n\nHuang also said while training AI models is resource intensive, it pays off in the long run.\n\n“One of the takeaways there is AI isn’t just about training the model, of course that’s just the first step,” he said. “It’s about using the model. And so when you use the model you save enormous amounts of time — processing time.”\n\nSolomon ended the conversation asking Huang about his biggest worry. Huang discussed how crucial Nvidia's chips are to its clients.\n\n“We have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us,” Huang said. “Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people. Because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.”\n\nHowever, Huang said it’s amazing to watch the AI his company uses to design the chips. “The part of that that is really intense is just the world on our shoulders,” Huang said. “Less sleep is fine. Three solid hours is all we need.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks I Would Buy Over Nvidia Right Now",
        "content": "Nvidia has been the best artificial intelligence (AI) stock to own for the past year and a half. But investors are starting to profit from their huge gains and realize that some of the lofty projections will be difficult to reach.\n\nAs a result, some might be looking elsewhere for top-tier AI investments. I have three that I think are worthy competitors that could outperform Nvidia.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest contract chipmaker. If a high-tech device has a chip in it, chances are it originated from TSMC, as it's known for short.\n\nTSMC believes that AI-related chips will be a huge growth avenue. Management projects a 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for these chips through 2027, by which time this emerging segment will make up more than 20% of its overall business. That's massive growth for a significant part of its business, making the company a fantastic AI stock pick.\n\nManagement also believes its total revenue will have a CAGR between 15% and 20% over the next few years, which is strong for a company as large as TSMC.\n\nFor just 25 times forward earnings, you can own one of the most dominant chip manufacturers available, one that will be a huge part of nearly every new innovation.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is probably better known by the social media companies it owns: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Nearly all of Meta's revenue comes from advertising on these platforms, allowing it to fund its AI research.\n\nIts generative AI model, Llama, is one of the best available and is currently being integrated throughout the company's various platforms, whether you are aware of it or not. Facebook has already launched generative AI features that allow advertisements to be tweaked depending on who is viewing them, which should make ads more effective.\n\nMeta's AI platform has many other uses, like integrating it with some of its augmented reality hardware.\n\nManagement has the cash cow of its ad business to fund research that practically no other company (except Alphabet) can match. Yet, the stock trades for just 24 times forward earnings.\n\nMeta is a no-brainer buy right now. You get its established dominant ad business, as well as the upside of its AI offerings.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is in a similar position as Meta. Its ad platform funds its AI research, but it must play catch-up to the undisputed generative AI model: ChatGPT. The latest iterations of Alphabet's Gemini model have been fantastic and outperformed ChatGPT in several key tests.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a large cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Much of the business world was already moving toward cloud computing, but the push for AI integration has only accelerated this movement. Companies now need access to vast amounts of computing power to train their AI models, and renting it from a provider like Google Cloud is a great idea.\n\nDespite its dominance in these key areas, Alphabet's stock is pretty cheap. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAlphabet is cheaper than the broader market, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 21, compared to the S&P 500's 23. I don't think Alphabet is a below-average business, though, which makes it a fantastic buy, especially considering its AI tailwinds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Web Services' competitive advantage in AI is its competitors",
        "content": "Amazon Web Services (AMZN) isn't putting all its chips on one AI model. Instead, it aims to win by keeping friends close and potential rivals closer.\n\nWhile other hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) compete on large language models, AWS hopes to offer customers whatever models they want. The cloud giant is positioning itself not just as an artificial intelligence platform to train models but as a marketplace to sell them.\n\n\"There's not going to be one model that's going rule them all,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"The best model today may not be the best model tomorrow. … If you have a platform that has a bunch of models available, it's actually relatively easy to take advantage of new ones or add new capabilities from other providers as they come along.\" An Amazon Web Services logo is pictured during a trade fair in Hannover Messe, in Hanover, Germany, April 22, 2024. (REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned this strategy on Amazon’s latest earnings call. Jassy noted that Amazon's Bedrock service has the \"broadest selection of LLMs\" and offers a variety of leading foundational models to AWS customers, who can then build their own AI applications using Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, Meta’s Llama 3 models, and Amazon's Titan models.\n\nThe latest example of this strategy emerged on Monday when AWS and Oracle announced a partnership despite 15 years of competition between the two cloud providers.\n\nCooperation, not direct competition, is how AWS plans to diversify its revenue streams and monetize AI. AWS is projecting $105 billion in revenue this year — about 17% of Amazon’s total revenue, according to estimates.\n\nAWS not 'rushing in' to chatbots\n\nWhen asked about the perception that Amazon is falling behind on AI — particularly when compared to Microsoft — Garman was quick to mention that for Microsoft, \"it’s not their own technology. … OpenAI was listed as a competitor of theirs, which is an interesting dynamic for them. ... We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\n\nIn other words, AWS’s perceived sluggishness in AI adoption is a strategic feature, not a bug.\n\n\"We felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology that ... looks cool and allows people to write haikus,\" Garman said. \"That's not really the eventual place that the value is going to come from this technology.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat focus on AI infrastructure has helped buoy the stock amid a tech pullback. Year to date, Amazon stock has gained 18%, outperforming the Nasdaq index and other hyperscalers, such as Microsoft and Google.\n\nAnd AWS is not just offering multiple LLMs to customers — the company is also offering chips from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), as well as their own.\n\n“If you talk to customers out there, still, the large majority of usage is on Nvidia chips,\" Garman said. \"They have a great platform … and they're very popular with customers.”\n\nThat popularity explains why AWS has yet to talk about competing directly with Nvidia on chips. While Garman would not share details about the usage ratio of Nvidia's chips to AWS's on internal workloads, he agreed it would be beneficial to rely more fully on their in-house chips over time to protect margins.\n\n“I don't know that we'll ever be fully reliant on [in-house chips] because I think that the Nvidia team builds some great processors and some great products, and they execute really well.”\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, Garman walked a fine line between promoting AWS chips while reminding the audience that AWS offers Nvidia GPUs as well, again promoting the idea of customer choice as AWS's key differentiator.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the Goldman conference on Wednesday morning. Garman quipped that he would have plenty to say about Nvidia's partnership with AWS.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Clash of the titans: Google and US attorneys kick off ad tech trial with clash over defining the market",
        "content": "Are the technologies that power online advertising all part of one giant market, or are there distinct markets within the multibillion-dollar industry?\n\nThe answer is critical to Google's defense in an antitrust case brought by the US Justice Department that went to trial on Monday in a packed Alexandria, Va., courtroom.\n\n\"Market definition, not just in this case, but in most antitrust cases, has potential to be outcome determinative,\" said former DOJ antitrust attorney Dan McCuaig, who is now a partner with Cohen Milstein.\n\nThe highly anticipated trial comes on the heels of Google's defeat in August an antitrust case where a Washington, D.C., judge ruled the tech giant illegally monopolized the market for online search engines.\n\nFor Google (GOOG), the broader the market, the more likely it can overcome federal prosecutors' claims that it illegally monopolized markets for online advertising technology in violation of antitrust laws.\n\n\"The DOJ wants to slice and dice the market,\" Google's lawyer Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison said in her opening statement. Dunn characterized the government's claims as gerrymandered in order to eliminate the existence of substitute online advertising services that could broaden the market.\n\n\"I think it's a clever play by Google,\" McCuaig said. \"I don't think it ultimately carries the day.\"\n\nMcCuaig said Google may have relied too strongly on a Supreme Court case involving American Express, in which the high court ruled that credit card networks were one market with two sides. Google's day in court: The US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, Va. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n'No such thing' as open web display ad tools\n\nAccording to the DOJ, businesses that offer technology to automate sale and purchase of ads on the open web, or \"open web display ads,\" operate in distinct markets. The technologies are responsible for processing more than $24 billion in online ad sales each year.\n\nProsecutors claim that Google illegally monopolized three markets for open web display ads: the publishing ad server market, the ad exchange market, and the advertiser ad network market.\n\nTogether, the technologies make it possible for website owners to organize and offer display ad space on their web and mobile pages. For advertisers, they help evaluate those advertising opportunities. Exchanges then process auctions for the ad, in real time, most of which is automated using algorithms.\n\nThere is \"no such thing\" as a \"tool for open web display ads,\" Google lawyer Dunn told US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide the case.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, Dunn argued, ad tech tools are just part of a larger online advertising market that, in addition to algorithm-driven or \"programatic\" auctions, also includes digital ad deals negotiated human-to-human.\n\nA single, two-sided market\n\nThat larger market, Google said, is a single, two-sided, rapidly changing one in which Google competes with other tech giants, including Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, TikTok, Roku, Disney, and Yahoo Finance's parent company Yahoo.\n\nOn top of that, Google said it also competes with ad tech companies that deal more exclusively in the businesses of supplying ad tech for publishers, advertisers, or exchange platforms.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the government's first four witnesses suggested that separate ad tech markets do, in fact, exist.\n\nJames Avery, founder and CEO of the ad tech company Kevel, testified that his company serves only the publisher side of the industry by building proprietary ad technologies for publishers. One goal of that type of technology, he said, is to make website owners less reliant on third-party ad tech, like Google's publisher server DoubleClick for Publishers.\n\nAvery said his company stopped trying to compete with Google around 2012, once he realized that he couldn't overcome the tech giant's rules that walled off rival publisher servers from accessing Google's real-time inventory on Google's exchange, AdX.\n\nAvery added that his publisher-side technology does not preference exchanges unless a customer chooses to do so.\n\n\"We have no horse in that race,\" Avery said, distinguishing Kevel's market from other parts of the ad tech stack. Gerrymandered? Jeannie Rhee, a lawyer representing Google in the Department of Justice's antitrust case against the tech giant, leaves the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a break in the trial, Monday, Sept. 9, 2024, in Alexandria, Va. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnother witness, Joshua Lowcock, president of the advertising data firm Quad (QUAD), testified that open web display ads, or \"programmatic\" display ads, are unique because they can be placed anywhere on the internet.\n\nThose ads are different from ads run on platforms such as Facebook (META), TikTok, or Amazon (AMZN), which run their own auctions on proprietary \"walled garden\" ad tech software.\n\n\"Direct\" transactions, otherwise known as human-to-human transactions, are another market still, Lowcock said, in that they are negotiated between real people.\n\n\"They are not substitutes,\" Lowcock said about the different ad platforms.\n\nLowcock admitted on cross-examination that his firm had suggested that a client replace ad spending on programmatic ads with ads bought through social media platforms, which tend to own their own ad auctions.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhether a consumer would substitute one product for another is integral to how Judge Brinkema will evaluate the DOJ's suggested markets.\n\nIn theory, if a substitute exists, the market should be defined broadly enough to include it.\n\nAndrew Casale, founder and CEO of ad exchange Index Exchange, testified for the government that exchanges are yet another part of the ad tech ecosystem, along with walled garden ad tech software that does not integrate with third-party exchanges.\n\n\"I view these as separate businesses,\" Casale said. \"We only compete in one business.\"\n\nOne antitrust expert who talked with Yahoo Finance doesn't buy what the Feds are selling.\n\nAlden Abbott, a Mercatus Center research fellow and former general counsel for the US Federal Trade Commission, said that despite the DOJ's claims, he views Microsoft, TikTok, Yahoo, and others as Google's online advertising competitors.\n\n\"I don't see how this is an antitrust problem,\" Abbott said. \"Where are the barriers to entry?\"\n\nAbbott and McCuaig said antitrust cases ultimately depend on the welfare of consumers, and the DOJ's case fails if it cannot prove that consumers are harmed by Google.\n\nOne obstacle to proving consumer harm, they said, is that the publisher- and advertiser-side technologies have no independent consumer demand absent their counterparts.\n\n\"Where is a harm to consumer welfare?\" Abbott asked. \"Antitrust, in my mind, is not supposed to design a market,\" Abbott said. \"That's not a role that governments should play.\"\n\nIt's uncertain how long the trial will last. Google's case over the DOJ's search monopoly claims lasted 10 weeks. Google will have a chance to call its own witnesses once the government rests its case.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Discounts: Buy These 3 Stocks (META, AAPL, NVDA)",
        "content": "Action over the last three months in the stock market has been marked by a notable shift in leaders from Tech and AI to more defensive sectors like Utilities, Healthcare, Real Estate and Bonds. In the chart below we can see that since June, the Real Estate ETF XLRE, Treasury ETF TLT, Utilities ETF XLU and Healthcare XLV have outperformed both SPY and QQQ by a fairly significant margin.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve signals the start of a rate-cutting regime and broad economic indicators (employment, growth, inflation) point to a slowdown (not a recession), it's not surprising that some investors have shifted to more conservative holdings.\n\nHowever, now that tech stocks have been out of favor for nearly three months, many of the leading names, such as the Magnificent Seven stocks have traded to quite attractive levels. In this article, I’ll highlight my top three picks moving forward—Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA)—along with key tactical trading levels to watch. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple: New iPhone and AI Innovations\n\nOn Monday, Apple unveiled a new lineup of products, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Key features of the iPhone 16 series include enhanced camera capabilities, improved battery life, a new Action button for quick shortcuts and its new AI system called Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 boasts upgraded health tracking features and a redesigned case. AirPods 4 offer improved audio quality, active noise cancellation, and enhanced hearing health features.\n\nApple has expanded its foray into health monitoring, with the AirPods now administering hearing tests and functioning as a 'clinical-grade' hearing aid. Additionally, the Apple Watch will now be able to monitor for sleep apnea by tracking breathing disturbances.\n\nAlthough critics often note the seemingly incremental improvements to these new Apple products, I find the health-monitoring functionalities especially compelling, while the new AI features could significantly improve usability.\n\nApple stock has notably outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks since May of this year, which is especially impressive considering the high volatility the market has experienced over the last three months. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAlong with the relative strength of Apple stock, a more granular look at the price action shows a potential bull flag forming. If the broad market can hold up and AAPL breaks out above the $220 level, it should make an attempt at new all-time highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the material integration of AI into the iPhone, the most widely used mobile device in the world sets up Apple to possibly ascend to AI leadership. At the least, if the AI narrative picks up again, Apple should be at the forefront. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMeta Platforms: A Well Rounded and Promising Stock Pick\n\nAlthough Meta Platforms seems to semi-regularly get caught up in frenzied controversy such as political scandals and misguided investments (Metaverse) the business continues to grow like crazy and spew profits. These manic cycles, although sometimes exhausting, have created numerous opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares at a discount.\n\nSales are expected to grow 19.8% this year and 13.9% next year, while earnings are projected to jump 43.6% this year and 12.7% next year. Analysts forecast earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years. Additionally, the stock is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.6x, which is inline with the market average and below its 10-year median valuation of 25x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms isn’t currently mixed up in any scandals and has rather been the second-best performing stock in the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023, bested only by Nvidia. But even with this incredible stock price appreciation, META remains among the cheapest of the group when comparing relative valuations thanks to equally impressive growth in EPS. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action in Meta Platforms’ stock also paints a bullish picture. In addition to relative strength, META is building out a bull flag, nest within a broader consolidation. If the stock can break out above the $515 level, it should move into the upper range and beyond. Alternatively, if the stock loses the lower bound support of ~$465, the broader market is likely selling off, and it may be prudent to wait for another opportunity. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nNvidia: Cheapest Relative Valuation in Years\n\nNvidia, the most exciting stock in the market over the last two years, has been struggling over the last three months. Between mid-June and early-August Nvidia staged a nasty correction, falling 35%. After rallying aggressively from the lows and testing the upper bound of the range, the shares have again sold off.\n\nHovering now just above $100, I think investors have an opportunity to buy the stock near the bottom of the range. And not only has the stock come down to more reasonable levels, so has the Semiconductor manufacturer’s valuation. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 38x, which is below its 10-year media of 42.8x and close to the lowest it has been in the last five years. With EPS forecast to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.9, which is a discount based on the metric.\n\nIf we look a little further into the future, Nvidia is trading at just 28x FY26 earnings. If growth remains as high as projected, Nvidia stock should continue to appreciate strongly.\n\nShould Investors Buy Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Apple Stock?\n\nGiven the current market conditions, a shift towards defensive sectors has created attractive buying opportunities among the tech leaders, particularly the Magnificent Seven. Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all experienced pullbacks in recent months, presenting investors with entry points at more reasonable valuations.\n\nApple, with its latest product releases and AI innovations, continues to show resilience and leadership, while Meta Platforms, despite past controversies, is experiencing tremendous growth and remains undervalued compared to its peers. Nvidia, despite its recent correction, offers high growth potential and is trading at its most attractive valuation in years.\n\nFor long-term investors, these stocks offer a blend of stability, innovation, and growth. Apple’s steady outperformance, Meta’s explosive earnings growth, and Nvidia’s dominance in AI and semiconductor technology make these three companies well-positioned for the next market uptrend. With their recent pullbacks, now may be the time to capitalize on their future potential before the market shifts back in favor of tech.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating and a price target of $600.\n\nLuria noted Meta Platforms as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most critical future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\n\nThe analyst said Meta Platforms has skillfully positioned itself as the open source leader for major technology platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nUnlike previous revolutionary innovations, Luria noted that a mega-cap could only win these two future platforms.\n\nWhile previous technology innovation was driven by nimble startups, AI and Spatial Computing require unprecedented scale, reach, and capital, the analyst said.\n\nWhile Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are crowding into the closed garden side of these platforms, Meta Platforms has the pole position on the open side, Luria noted.\n\nThe analyst expects the closed-garden side of the AI compute platform to be an expensive fight between the Big Techs, but he noted that Meta is almost entirely alone on the open-source side.\n\nGoogle will need to manage the headwind of transitioning to AI-enhanced Search, Meta is already reporting how the advancements in AI are driving better ad delivery and yields, Luria flagged.\n\nIn spatial computing, the analyst expects the tens of billions Meta Platforms have poured into Reality Labs to become the moat that positions Meta Platforms as the open-source winner alongside Apple’s closed garden.\n\nThe analyst said Meta exemplifies the benefits of being led by its founder more than any other mega-cap, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nLuria’s price target represents 24x 2025 EPS, a premium to Alphabet based on better positioning. The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality Lab’s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\n\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for META\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jul 2020 Desjardins Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Alphabet, Meta initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nJMP Securities upgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $175 price target. The company reported better than expected fiscal Q1 results, while guidance was better on earnings and in line on revenue, the analyst tells investors in a research note. BofA upgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $80, up from $76. The firm cites a combination of data center exposure, valuation and the forthcoming addition of a new CEO. JPMorgan upgraded Delek US(DK) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $26, up from $23. The company has generated consolidated EBITDA of $45M on a value-neutral basis by reinvesting high multiple proceeds into lower multiple acquisitions and organic projects, the firm tells investors in a research note. Deutsche Bank upgraded Equity Residential (EQR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $83, up from $62. The firm sees the company's coastal exposure as a \"major positive given limited oncoming supply and healthy tenant demand.\" Jefferies upgraded Relay Therapeutics(RLAY) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $16, up from $10.60, after the company reported interim data for RLY-2608. Management's thesis on higher selectivity equaling better safety and tolerability seems to have held up based on the data, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nRedburn Atlantic downgraded Costco (COST) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $890, up from $860. The firm says that while Costco's ongoing comp and market share gains should continue to drive \"decent\" earnings growth, the stock's current risk/reward profile is \"skewing less favorably given the even higher than normal expectations\" priced into a starting point of a 50-times price-to-earnings ratio on fiscal 2025 estimates. Goldman Sachs downgraded Nutrien (NTR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $69, represents 14% upside from current levels. The company's retail segment could be a source of incremental volatility and risk over the next 12 months from potential increases in bad debt expense and loss reserves relating to NTR Financial, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays downgraded Methanex (MEOH) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $44, down from $56. The firm believes the OCI ownership will present overhangs on the stock. Lake Street downgraded Limoneira (LMNR) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $25. Limoneira's operations continue to show solid improvement, its asset monetization strategy \"still has room to run,\" and its avocado expansion strategy is increasingly well considered, but the firm believes Limoneira is \"reasonably valued\" at a $450M market cap. BTIG downgraded Bionano Genomics (BNGO) to Neutral from Buy without a price target after the company announced its fourth workforce reduction since early 2023. The downgrade is driven by the ongoing challenging capital markets environment, particularly for small cap companies, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. As the company faces challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity will migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning is mixed, the firm tells investors in a research note. DA Davidson initiated coverage of Meta Platforms(META) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm calls Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its \"combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\" Susquehanna initiated coverage of Dell Technologies(DELL) with a Neutral rating and $120 price target. The firm sees two risk factors that have led to its below-consensus EPS estimates, namely the economics of AI hardware remain uncertain and the strategy for scaling AI services remains unclear. Bernstein initiated coverage of GE Aerospace(GE) with an Outperform rating and $201 price target. As a focused aerospace company, GE is \"set in a commercial aviation market at a uniquely positive time,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of MKS Instruments(MKSI) with an Overweight rating and $140 price target. The firm views MKS as the market leader in wafer fab equipment subsystems and substrate equipment.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "AMD (AMD) chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su says her company is just getting started with the high-powered AI chip drops.\n\n\"We have accelerated our AI roadmap and are on a one year cadence of new products,\" Su told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Monday. \"It is an AI supercycle.\"\n\nLater this year, AMD will show off its MI325 AI chip followed by the MI350 next year and the MI400 in 2026 — taking aim at rival Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance.\n\nAdded Su, \"We believe we can have a very significant piece of the training and inference of these large language models.\"\n\nThe new MI chips teased by Su come hot on the heels of a successful debut of the MI300x release about a year ago. It can use up to 192GB of memory, and boasts an astounding 153 billion transistors.\n\nThe beefy memory capabilities mean AMD's AI chip could be used to train large language models — such as OpenAI's ChatGPT — commonly known as \"LLMs.\" This is a segment that has been dominated by Nvidia, but AMD is keen on carving out its own position in a rapidly growing marketplace.\n\nSu tells us AMD may notch $4.5 billion in sales from this chip alone in 2024, up from about $100 million in AI related chip revenue last year. The company's previous guidance for the MI300 was around $4 billion in sales this year.\n\nIt's the fastest-growing product in AMD's history, Su says.\n\n\"The MI300 guidance raise [in the second quarter] is a positive vs. falling expectations (including ours). AMD noted that supply/technical concerns are overstated and stated that they have not seen any cuts this year from their top customers (we believe Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Oracle (ORCL) are top 3). We assume the street will stay around $5 billion this year, which still supports the potential for $8-9 billion next year,\" Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis said in a client note.\n\nThe momentum behind AI chips continues to power AMD's top and bottom lines.\n\nSecond quarter sales and earnings rose 9% and 19% year over year.\n\nAt the mid-point of its third quarter revenue outlook, AMD sees year over year growth of about 16% and sequential growth of approximately 15%.\n\n\"AI is a much larger cycle than I would have expected five years ago,\" Su says. \"We are making big bets now for the next five years.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other big company stocks.\n\nMega-cap stocks—major technology companies to be precise—continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500’s 40%+ gain.\n\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies’ stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\n\n3Q 2024 Earnings Season – A Preview\n\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\n\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks.  Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\n\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\n\nAmidst Worries, Investors Should Stick to Big Company Stocks\n\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\n\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\n\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\n\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the big and well-established companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates as a social technology company. It builds applications and technologies that help people connect, locate communities, and grow businesses.\n\nConsidering the company’s network effects concerning its massive user base, and intangible assets consisting of a massive collection of data users have shared on the company’s sites and apps, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be well-placed for strong and stable growth over the medium term.  Considering the company’s capability to profitably monetize its network through advertising, the company should comfortably generate excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s ad revenue per user continues to grow. This demonstrates that advertisers are seeing value in working with the firm. The company has strategically accumulated data about everyone via Facebook and/or Instagram accounts, which are benefiting the advertisers in some form or the other. In 2Q 2024, the company’s average price per ad went up by 10% YoY. The company continues to incorporate AI technology into its various offerings and focuses on launching VR products, which should enhance user engagement and drive further growth in advertising revenue.\n\nIn 2Q 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s advertising revenue increased $6.83 billion, or 22% on the YoY basis because of growth in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. The growth in ad impressions delivered was mainly because of an increase in users and their engagement with the company’s products. For 3Q 2024, it expects total revenue in the range of $38.5 billion - $41 billion.\n\nWolfe Research initiated coverage on shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) on 16th July. They issued an “Outperform” rating and gave the price target of $620.00. Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC, an investment management company, released second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the best big company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "A Look Into Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Impressive Returns On Capital",
        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), we liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.30 = US$62b ÷ (US$230b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nSo, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 30%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIt's hard not to be impressed by Meta Platforms' returns on capital. The company has employed 95% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 30%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Meta Platforms can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Meta Platforms' ROCE\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Meta Platforms has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 169% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nMeta Platforms does have some risks though, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you might be interested in.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Temu growth is slowing down in the US: BofA",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Temu's growth in the U.S. market is beginning to show signs of deceleration, according to a note from Bank of America on Monday.\n\nCiting data from Bloomberg Second Measure (BSM), BofA analysts noted that Temu's observed sales growth in the U.S. slowed to 37% year-over-year in August, down from 45% in July and significantly lower than the 99% growth seen in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThis slowdown comes after a period of rapid expansion in 2023, when Temu's market share ramped up significantly.\n\nBofA analysts attribute the deceleration to tough year-over-year comparisons and plateauing sales, with Temu's market share relative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stabilizing at around 3% in the first seven months of 2024.\n\nHowever, Temu saw a slight 40 basis point increase in August, bringing its share to 3.4%. Despite this, daily active users (DAUs) have been on the decline, dropping 17% year-over-year in August, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\n\"BSM data also indicates that absolute sales dollars vs. Amazon had seemingly plateaued at around 3% in the first 7 months of 2024, after ramping in 2023, though we do note a solid 40bps m/m in August to 3.4% (Temu grew 3.5% m/m while Amazon was down m/m following Prime Day),\" wrote BofA.\n\nThe note also highlights comments from Temu's parent company, Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: PDD), which noted that \"high revenue growth is not sustainable\" and pointed to new challenges, including a shift toward quality over low prices and increasing global competition.\n\nPDD is said to be taking steps to address these challenges by supporting higher-quality merchants and removing \"bad actors\" from its platform.\n\nWhile Temu's slowing growth may have a limited impact on the broader U.S. eCommerce sector, BofA analysts caution that online advertisers like Meta (NASDAQ:META) could face slight headwinds.\n\nWith 10% of Meta's revenue coming from China-based advertisers, a slowdown in ad spend from companies like Temu and Shein could pose a minor challenge, though the bank says that broader declines would be needed for a significant impact.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTemu growth is slowing down in the US: BofA\n\nUS SEC hits 7 public companies with penalties for violating whistleblower protections\n\nUS stocks open higher following biggest weekly sell-off in more than a year\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.07 indicates a change of +12.7% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.62 billion and $184.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.8% and +13.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc. (META): Redditors Are Bullish On This AI Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging. Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\n\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\n\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“A recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google’s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.”\n\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\n\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\n\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\n\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\n\nA distinguished MIT professor, Frédo Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\n\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\n\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

This translated into a revenue of $39.07 billion. The revenue surge came from a 10% increase in both the number of ads served and the cost per ad. 219 hedge funds were long in Meta (NASDAQ:META) as of June 30. GQG Partners is the top investor with a stake worth $5.4 billion.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has acquired nearly 600,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs and is also developing its custom chip.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American tech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\n\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\n\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\n\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\n\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\n\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\n% of shares shorted: 1.25%\n\nMeta's Facebook is the world's largest social network, with more than 3 billion monthly active users. Advertisers find American tech giant's platforms appealing due to their growing user base and engagement, as well as the important data they produce. The company's top-line growth and cash flow are expected to be positively impacted by these priceless assets, and Morningstar analysts predict that advertisers will continue to spend more online.\n\nThrough its Reality Labs branch, META is making significant investments in the metaverse, VR, and AR technologies. However, the company has come under fire for making substantial payments to these new consumer platforms.\n\nThe company's price objective of $550 is maintained by BofA Securities, even though the company intends to reduce Reality Labs' hardware expenditure by 20% by 2026. The potential budget drop is viewed as a strategic response to falling demand for VR devices, even though consumer interest in AR glasses remains high.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) posted a higher-than-expected profit of $13.5 billion in Q2 2024 raising its stock price by over 7%. Revenue for the latest quarter came in at $39 billion, which was 22% more than last year and exceeded market projections. Third-quarter revenue for the tech behemoth with headquarters in California is expected to range from $38.5 billion to $41 billion.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company, with 12,428,700 shares worth $6.27 billion.\n\nOverall META ranks 10th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\n\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\n\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\n\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\n\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 219\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $49.2 million\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. With roughly 3.2 billion people using its applications as of March 2024, it is one of the biggest social media and connectivity firms in the world. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) with a sizeable moat that reduces the pressure for growth on management. As a result, the key drivers of the firm's hypothesis include its ability to maintain the user base, increase average revenue per user, and introduce new products and services to monetize the user base. On these fronts, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has lately been implementing artificial intelligence into its products. The firm plans to use AI to enable advertisers to autonomously create their campaigns, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also setting itself up for AI monetization through its AI Studio which enables users on its platform to create their own AI. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s technology focused management and business has also allowed it to create its own AI model called Llama. This means that the firm does not have to license AI from others, such as OpenAI.\n\nEvercore analyst Mark Mahaney shared how Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is monetizing AI during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\n“If you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that’s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.”\n\nOverall META ranks 7th on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Wall Street veteran Alex Green issues warning to Americans who invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks\n\nFor many investors, stocks that pay dividends represent the height of reliability. Just witness the track records of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and its main competitor PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP): Both rank among the 53 “dividend kings” that have increased shareholder payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nYet the question remains whether paying dividends is really the most resourceful option.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n\"There are some companies that are growing so rapidly that the best use of their cash is not to pay dividends to shareholders or even to buy back their own shares, but to reinvest in their own operations” said The Oxford Club’s Chief Investment Strategist Alex Green in a recent interview with finance YouTuber Ari Gutman.\n\nMarket giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have opted over time for the latter. That sets the stage for more growth, which can in turn lead to higher share prices.\n\nGreen recalled a time more than 24 years ago when he worked on Wall Street and advised a client to buy shares in billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). The client, who was retired, took a pass because they wanted some steady income and the company didn't pay out dividends. (It still doesn't.)\n\n\"Think how well he would have done if he'd have bought those shares of Berkshire and just sold a little bit off each year if he needed some income,\" Green said. “That’s what everyone needs is return, not income.”\n\nWe did the math and since the year 2000, the stock has soared by more than 1,200%.\n\nHow dividends work — and sometimes fall short\n\nA dividend is a shareholder payout companies make, usually on a quarterly basis, based on their profits. Many investors like them because it can act as a steady source of income.\n\nFor example, sitting atop the “dividend kings” utilities sector you’ll find two businesses that have upped their dividend growth for 69 consecutive years: American States Water (NYSE:AWR) and Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN). This is as ranked by Simply Safe Dividends whose tagline says it all: \"We're boring and conservative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet as Green’s too-careful client learned the hard way, boring and conservative can be humbling and costly. Consider the aforementioned Amazon, a high-flying company whose stock is doing better now than it has over the last two years. Since last year, the stock is up by more than 100%.\n\nOut of 65 analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, 54 call it a \"buy.\" And it has never offered a dividend. Compare that to American States Water, whose stock has lowered over the same period.\n\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nSkepticism over dividend-centered investing is nothing new. But it’s not that dividend stocks are bad bets in and of themselves; rather, they can be part of a balanced portfolio that could include even more conservative investments such as bonds and riskier ones such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, tech-sector companies that famously resisted dividends have gotten into the game. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started paying out dividends in 2012, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gave out its first-ever dividends in June 2024.\n\nJust a few months prior, Meta (NASDAQ:META) announced its first dividend effective Feb. 22. In each case, the dividend marked a point where the companies had matured past their go-go stages and had plenty of money to sit on. All three today boast market caps measured in trillions of dollars.\n\nGreen urged investors to think of stocks not just in terms of dividends, which many treat as income, but total returns. If a stock skyrockets, its share price will far outpace even the biggest dividend; in the S&P 500, that's offered by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).\n\n“I have nothing against dividend investing,” he said. “A lot of smart people are dividend oriented and there are a lot of great dividend-paying stocks out there. But I just would warn people not to invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks.”\n\nWhat to read next\n\nUnlock access to 4,700+ hand-picked, single-family homes across America — and the juicy rental cash they can generate.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Smart investing means staying patient. Indeed, numerous studies agree: The longer someone stays invested in the stock market, the greater their returns.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a closer look at two fantastic buy-and-hold candidates and explore why long-term investors should seriously consider them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first no-brainer stock I want to highlight is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). There are dozens of reasons to own this iconic company, but let's focus a bit on a few key financial metrics that explain why Amazon is a great stock to own for the long term.\n\nFirst, Amazon is enormous. Its annual revenue is over $600 billion, trailing only Walmart in terms of revenue generated by an American company.\n\nSecond, despite its massive size, Amazon is growing impressively. Its revenue is growing at around 10% year over year, meaning that, at its current size, Amazon is adding about $60 billion per year in new sales.\n\nThird, Amazon is on the cutting edge of some of the world's most exciting new technologies. The company's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is generating much of that new annual revenue, as it is growing at a faster clip than the rest of the company -- roughly 19% year over year. In addition, Amazon is a pioneer in the robotics industry -- with over 750,000 robots working day and night in its fulfillment centers. Finally, the company has many artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including using generative AI to streamline its e-commerce business and its ubiquitous voice-powered echo devices.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's large and growing sales figures show that the company continues to find new ways to serve its existing customers and attract new ones. Over the next decade, Amazon remains a no-brainer stock to own thanks to its combination of proven businesses and innovative new ventures.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe next no-brainer stock to own is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).The reason Meta is such an obvious pick is that the company delivers on the most important factor for any stock: It drives shareholder value.\n\nWhat I mean is that Meta generates a ton of free cash flow -- which is the lifeblood of any great stock.\n\nThink of a garden hose. When the spigot is fully open, water comes flying out at a rapid pace. The more the valve is closed, the less water makes it out the other end of the hose.\n\nIn the case of a company, the valve represents operating expenses and capital spending, and the water represents free cash flow -- it's what's left over after employee salaries, taxes, capital expenditures, and many other costs have been subtracted from revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's so great about Meta is that the company generates a ton of free cash flow. Moreover, its total keeps on growing larger. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nOver the last 10 years, Meta has increased its free cash flow from about $3 billion to almost $50 billion. That's astounding. Bear in mind that many large companies you've heard of don't generate $50 billion in sales, let alone free cash flow.\n\nSimply put, Meta's free cash flow makes it a stock market juggernaut. With so much free cash flow at its disposal, the company can return value to its shareholders in any number of ways, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, or making acquisitions.\n\nIn short, it gives Meta's management many ways to increase its share price. And that's something that should make investors happy for many years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This ESG Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other ESG stocks.\n\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\n\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\n“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”\n\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\n\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 2.51%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the top five on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy now. The social media giant achieved net-zero emissions across its global operations in 2020 and is now focused on reaching net-zero emissions across its entire value chain by 2030. As part of this effort, Meta is actively engaging with its suppliers to decarbonize its supply chain, aiming for at least two-thirds of them to set Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-aligned reduction goals by 2026.\n\nOn August 8, Loop Capital raised its price target for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from $550 to $575, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. This upgrade follows Meta’s strong financial performance, which showed impressive growth and outpaced other major advertising platforms, including Amazon Ads, for the second consecutive quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also exceeded analyst expectations with its latest quarterly results, suggesting that its significant investments in AI are likely to yield further benefits. Following the results, Citi expressed increased optimism about Meta’s prospects, citing gains in user engagement, monetization, and expanding margins. Citi subsequently raised its price target for Meta from $550 to $580.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) ‘Isn’t Buying Because They’re Worried That The Other Guys Might Do Something’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\n“There is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing. Money is just not talked about. Frankly, it’s become the third rail of American education. You’re a thousand times more likely to read Marx’s “Das Kapital” than to read anything about planning a budget or picking stocks.”\n\nCramer’s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\n“That’s why I’m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you’re going to stop working—hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I’m betting most of you, even if you don’t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\n\nDecades ago, corporate pensions started going the way of the dodo, and now the 401(k) is the main way that Americans save for retirement. They’re offered by your employer, and they’re among the greatest tax-deferred investment vehicles out there, along with the IRA. And I’m not talking about the Irish Republican Army—I’m not even talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, for that matter. I mean the Individual Retirement Account.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it’s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\n“Hear me out, darn it—you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there’s a lot the so-called experts don’t tell you or don’t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)—you’d have to be a fool not to contribute.\n\nMany experts will even advise you to max out your 401(k) contributions every year if you can afford to. Right now, the maximum contribution is over 20 grand, with room for an additional 7 grand if you’re over 50. It tends to rise gradually over time, usually a little faster than inflation. In 2004, it was $13,000; by 2023, it was $22,500. Either way, that’s a serious chunk of change, even with these contributions coming from your pre-tax income.”\n\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\n“However, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I’m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it’s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns—sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I’ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)—maybe there’s a better way for you to invest for retirement.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The Large Cap Stock Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nMarket Capitalization: 1.94T\n\nJim Cramer notes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s recent concerns about not making acquisitions are driven by the fear of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) potentially surpassing them. According to Cramer, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s hesitation is rooted in a specific worry: that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could catch up and overtake Google in the competitive landscape.\n\n“Google isn’t buying because they’re worried that the other guys might do something. They’re specifically worried that Meta is going to catch and pass them and they should be.”\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s latest earnings report reveals a strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $84.7 billion, a 14% increase from the previous year. This growth was fueled by exceptional results in its key areas, such as Search and Cloud. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s operating income surged to $27.4 billion, while net income climbed to $23.6 billion, showcasing significant improvement. The Search business was particularly successful, contributing $73.9 billion in revenue, and YouTube advertising grew by 13% to $8.66 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the Cloud segment performed remarkably well, with revenue increasing by 28.8% to $10.35 billion and achieving over $1 billion in quarterly operating profit for the first time. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s commitment to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) enhances its growth prospects. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s focus on advancing AI within its Search and Cloud services is expected to yield substantial returns as AI becomes more widely adopted across various sectors. While there are some challenges in its Network ads segment, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s strong performance in Search, Cloud, and AI positions it well for ongoing growth and profitability.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nFirst Outside Facebook Investor: Today, social media company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is valued at $1.3 trillion. Thiel invested $500,000 in the company back in 2004 as the first outside investor. The company’s valuation back then was $4.9 million.\n\nThiel owned 10.2% of the company and held more than 44 million shares when the company held its IPO in 2012. Thiel sold 16.8 million shares in the IPO, making $640 million and would later sell the majority of his position.\n\nAll told, Thiel turned his $500,000 investment in Facebook into more than $1 billion, as reported by CNN.\n\nBacking Trump: Thiel’s political involvement in recent years has become a hot topic. The investor is backing Donald Trump in the 2024 election and also has ties to Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance. The senator and vice-presidential candidate previously worked at Mithril Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Thiel. The support for Trump in the 2024 election by Thiel may be less this election cycle.\n\n“If you hold a gun to my head, I will vote for Trump. I’d rather have him...than Biden,” Thiel said earlier this year.\n\nWhile Thiel donated over $1 million to Trump for the 2016 election and spoke in support of him at the 2016 Republican National Convention, the investor said he would be less involved for the 2024 election. Thiel also ruled out donating to Trump’s super PAC (political action committee).\n\nA falling out ahead of the 2020 election and a heated phone call with Trump that came to light in recent months show that the relationship between Thiel and Trump has soured over the years. Thiel was a large donor to the Republican party in 2022, listed as the fifth largest individual donor and 11th largest donor overall for the 2022 election according to a report.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelationship with Musk: As a prominent Silicon Valley investor, Thiel’s path has crossed with Elon Musk many times. Their most prominent connection over the years was at PayPal.\n\nThe merger of Thiel’s Confinity and Musk’s X became PayPal. Musk served as CEO of the payments company before he was ousted by a group that replaced him with Thiel.\n\nKnown as a member of the PayPal Mafia today, Thiel and Musk have a friendly relationship now even though it was once tense. Thiel has invested in SpaceX and The Boring Company and his Founders Fund recently led an investment round in Musk’s Neuralink company.\n\nRead More:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nHaving a Hand In Ethereum Creation: Benzinga previously wrote on the butterfly effect, or an idea that small events can have non-linear impacts on a complex level, for the creation of Ethereum.\n\nVitalik Buterin, who is the most famous co-founder of Ethereum, may never have launched the cryptocurrency if it wasn’t for a small change made in the popular video game World of Warcraft. This change led to Buterin becoming heavily interested in Bitcoin and would go on to write for Bitcoin Weekly and co-found Bitcoin Magazine.\n\nButerin dropped out of university to focus on cryptocurrency and later obtained a $100,000 grant from the Thiel Foundation, which was created by Thiel.\n\n“I went around the world, explored many crypto projects and finally realized that they were all too concerned about specific applications and not being sufficiently general — hence the birth of Ethereum, which has been taking up my life ever since,” Buterin previously said.\n\nWhile the change in World of Warcraft may have had a bigger impact, it could be theorized that if Buterin didn’t get the Thiel Foundation award, Ethereum might not exist in the same capacity today. The fellowship award came after Buterin’s idea for Ethereum but before the official launch of the cryptocurrency.\n\nLover of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Among the items that helped shape Thiel’s childhood and life were a love of science fiction and fantasy. Thiel played Dungeons & Dragons as a kid and also loved to read science fiction by authors like Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein.\n\nThiel was also obsessed with author J.R.R. Tolkien, who wrote “The Lord of the Rings.” Multiple Thiel-related companies have names that are connected to Tolkien including Mithril Capital (a precious metal found in Middle-earth) and Palantir, named after “seeing stones” in “The Lord of the Rings.”\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. \r\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article Peter Thiel Supports Trump, Backed Ethereum's Buterin: 5 Facts You Might Not Know About PayPal, Palantir Co-Founder originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of Nvidia",
        "content": "With the attention artificial intelligence (AI) is getting, it's easy to focus on Nvidia as a top tech stock. It's a great pick and has performed incredibly well, but there are other stocks that look more attractive right now.\n\nThree that I have my eye on are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Procore Technologies (NYSE: PCOR). I think they all offer a great compromise between growth and value, and are far better buys than Nvidia today.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC for short, is the largest contract chip manufacturer in the world. It takes designs from giants like Nvidia and Apple and produces them, making it a winner regardless of which company is ahead in the AI race.\n\nTSMC is at the cutting edge of technology. It has market-leading 3 nanometer (3nm) chips and is already working on its next-generation 2nm chips. These chips can be configured to offer more computing power or be more efficient.\n\nWith the computing power of existing technology already impressive, it's more likely that TSMC's clients will choose more-efficient versions, especially since the input costs for AI computing hardware are so high. This could drive even more demand for its chips, making the stock a strong buy.\n\nManagement projects 15% to 20% compound annual revenue growth, which gives it the potential to be a market-crushing stock. With shares still down around 10% from their July highs, now is a great time to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It also has its Reality Labs division, which offers products like virtual reality headsets.\n\nBut all investors really need to focus on is its advertising business on its social media sites, which accounts for 98% of revenue. Meta investors just have to learn to balance the benefits of advertising with the high unprofitability of Reality Labs.\n\nHolistically, Meta is truly an impressive business: 38% operating margins with 22% revenue growth. Those are fantastic metrics, yet the stock trades for 24 times forward earnings. Considering that the S&P 500 as a whole trades for 23 times forward earnings, it's a real bargain because its business is far better than the average S&P 500 constituent.\n\nMeta is slated to continue its social media dominance, and if one of its Reality Labs products becomes a hit, the stock could be a massive winner.\n\nProcore Technologies\n\nProcore is a name you might not have heard of, but its construction management software is revolutionizing the industry. Unlike nearly every other sector that went through a software revolution over the last decade, the construction industry has only recently benefited from widespread cellular connectivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that it's possible, Procore's software is incredibly popular since it allows contractors, subcontractors, and project owners to all work from the same information source, reducing extra costs from having to fix errors. So, if an engineer makes a change to the electrical schematic, they can upload it to Procore, and the electrical contractor can access the changes nearly instantly at the jobsite.\n\nDespite its popularity, Procore has a long way to grow in its target market. In its 2023 investor day presentation, it estimated that it has captured less than 2% of businesses, with about 12% of construction monetary volume. Worldwide, it's even less, with about 1% and 2%, respectively. PCOR Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn light of the industry's size, Procore has the potential to turn into a massive business if it keeps up its growth trajectory. In the second quarter, revenue rose 24% year over year. The business is not profitable but is getting closer each quarter.\n\nWith its massive runway, it shouldn't be long before Procore starts generating a profit and rewarding its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Next Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split",
        "content": "Stock splits have been a big thing this year, with top companies across industries launching these efforts to lower their high-flying stock prices. A stock split, by issuing new shares to current holders, decreases the per-share price of a company. And among these stock split announcements, many have come from artificial intelligence (AI) players -- from Nvidia to Broadcom.\n\nThat's as shares of companies operating in this high-growth space have taken off. For example, Nvidia and Broadcom have seen their shares climb more than 300% and 200%, respectively, over the past three years.\n\nAnd today, with prices of AI stocks still reaching well into the hundreds of dollars, the stock split wave isn't over. In fact, one stock in particular looks like an excellent candidate thanks to its solid growth in recent years, top share price performance, and long-term prospects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTrading for more than $500 a share\n\nWhich company am I talking about? My prediction is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) will be the next AI stock to split. The stock has climbed nearly 50% this year and is trading for more than $500 a share. Meta is a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a top-performing group of technology stocks that have led market gains over the past year -- and it's the only one that has never completed a stock split.\n\nSo, let's consider why a stock split would be a good idea for Meta. It's true that these operations don't act as catalysts for stock movement because they don't change anything fundamental about a company -- investors won't buy a stock just because it launched a stock split. Stock splits don't impact valuation, so a stock won't become cheaper after the operation even though its per-share price is lower.\n\nBut a split still can be a very positive move for a company over the long term for two reasons. First, by lowering the per-share price, a split opens the investment opportunity up to a broader range of investors. Many no longer will have to turn to fractional shares -- which may not even be available through their brokerage -- to invest in the stock.\n\nSecond, a stock split signals to the investment community that the company is optimistic about its future. The idea is, from the new lower price, that particular stock can once again roar higher over time.\n\nOne of the cheapest Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nMeta still is one of the least expensive of the Magnificent Seven, the second-cheapest after Alphabet when considering forward earnings estimates. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nBut at its current per-share price, it may be progressing into out-of-reach territory for some investors. By lowering the price, Meta could expand its potential investor pool. Now is a great time to launch a split because investors are interested in companies that are highly involved in AI, seen as an area with explosive potential well into the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI market is expected to grow from $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Meta aims to be at the forefront and is pouring investment into AI to make that happen. The company has made the technology its biggest investment area this year and has said it expects to have 600,000 of H100 equivalents in graphics processing unit compute on board by the end of the year.\n\nYou probably know Meta best for its social media apps, from Facebook to Instagram, and these top platforms bring in billions of dollars in revenue through advertising. Meta wants to use AI to make these apps better, which should attract more and more ad revenue over time -- and the company's aggressive AI investment could expand its product and service offerings as well.\n\nMeta's solid track record of earnings growth means it has the resources necessary to carry out its plan. Earlier this year, the company launched its first dividend, saying it has the financial strength to reward shareholders and fund growth.\n\nSo the timing looks right for a stock split from this company that's making AI its priority, and that's why my prediction is Meta will be the next on the AI stock split list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 37% of His $25.7 Billion Portfolio Invested in 5 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the current market rally -- and with good reason. These next-generation algorithms generate original text and images, streamline processes, and automate menial and time-consuming tasks, all with a few simple keystrokes. The potential for vast increases in productivity has companies lining up to see how they can best deploy AI to benefit their respective businesses.\n\nPhilippe Laffont knows a thing or two about profiting from emerging technology. The billionaire trained under the watchful eye of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson of Tiger Global Management. Laffont heads up Coatue Management, the world's premier tech-centric hedge fund, which he founded in 1999. Since then, he's parlayed $50 million in starting capital into a financial empire with $58 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, Coatue has far outpaced the returns of the broader market, delivering annualized returns of 14% over the past three years, compared to 8% for the S&P 500.\n\nLaffont believes AI will be one of the prevailing investing themes over the coming decade, and he has his money where his mouth is: Five top AI stocks are Coatue's five largest holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Meta Platforms -- 8.2% of holdings\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Coatue's largest AI holding -- and largest overall position, with nearly 4.2 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. Laffont trimmed the position by 3%, but gains during the second quarter left the position relatively unchanged. It isn't surprising that Meta is his largest position, given the company's long track record of using AI to its advantage. From surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms to recognizing and tagging people in photos, Meta was an early adopter of earlier branches of AI.\n\nThe company is something of an exception compared to its big tech colleagues, as Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to hawk its AI. That didn't stop the company from creating its homegrown Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama), which is available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Advertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue, so the company offers a growing suite of free-to-use AI-powered tools that help marketers on its platforms succeed, which keeps them coming back for more.\n\nImproving economic conditions are already lifting its digital advertising business. And at just 24 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive in light of its vast opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was already Laffont's second largest position, but he increased it by 7% in Q2. It now totals roughly 10.8 million shares worth nearly $2.1 billion. The e-commerce and cloud giant also has a long history of deploying AI. Amazon uses AI to surface relevant products for its online shoppers, recommend programming choices to its Prime Video and Music audience, determine the most efficient delivery routes for its e-commerce shipments, and plan inventory levels at its warehouses, among other uses. More recently, Amazon released generative AI tools to answer shoppers' questions and help sellers create compelling product descriptions.\n\nLet's not forget Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched Bedrock AI to offer the most popular generative AI models to its cloud customers. The company also created AI-specific chips -- dubbed Inferentia and Trainium -- to accelerate AI processing on AWS.\n\nThe improving economic conditions are expected to be a boon to Amazon, and AI will no doubt play a part in its success. And at less than 3 times sales, the price is right.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is the \"world's largest and best semiconductor foundry,\" according to the company. Since state-of-the-art chips are the heart of AI processing, it isn't surprising that TSMC is Laffont's third-largest position. He added more than 1 million shares in the second quarter, increasing his holdings by 10%. Coatue's position now amounts to 11.4 million shares, collectively worth roughly $2 billion.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has increased demand for the world's most advanced processors. TSMC dominates the semiconductor foundry space, with an estimated 62% of the market. More importantly, the company manufactures roughly 92% of the world's most advanced chips -- including most of the processors used for AI.\n\nGiven TSMC's pivotal role in the industry and the widespread belief that the AI revolution is still in its early stages, the next few years should provide a windfall for the company -- and its shareholders. And at just 25 times forward earnings, TSMC is still reasonably priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Nvidia -- 6.6% of holdings\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may well be the standard bearer for the AI revolution, so it's only natural it would figure prominently in Laffont's portfolio. Coatue trimmed its position by less than 1% during the second quarter, but the value of its holdings increased, thanks to 37% gains for Nvidia stock. Laffont now owns roughly 13.8 million shares worth $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the gold standard for AI processing in data centers and cloud computing, having previously been the go-to for machine learning,  an earlier branch of AI. Even with an estimated 90% market share, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and has accelerated its product release schedule to a one-year cadence. This dramatic increase in the pace of its chip development will make it even tougher for rivals to compete.\n\nThe triple-digit year-over-year growth Nvidia has delivered for five consecutive quarters is expected to decelerate this year but remain high by historical standards. Despite dominating the AI chip market, Nvidia stock is reasonably priced, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 5: Microsoft -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was quick to enter the AI revolution, integrating AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services and offering a growing suite of AI models on its Azure Cloud platform. That's probably why it's Laffont's fifth-largest holding, one he increased by nearly 21,000 shares in Q2. The position now amounts to 3.7 million shares worth nearly $1.7 billion.\n\nHowever, the company's biggest coup was likely the release of Copilot, its productivity-enhancing suite of AI-powered assistants. While Microsoft doesn't yet break out its results, some on Wall Street believe that Copilot -- and, more broadly, AI -- could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027. It's also having an impact now, as Microsoft's proliferation of AI services is having a halo effect on its Azure Cloud, contributing 8 percentage points of growth in its most recent quarter.\n\nThe stock is selling for 31 times forward earnings which is an attractive price given Microsoft's growth potential. META Chart\n\nAll long-term winners\n\nEach of these stocks is well known for dominating their respective industries, but it's their performance since the AI revolution kicked off early last year that really stands out. As you can see from the chart above, every one of Laffont's five top holdings have outperformed the S&P 500, and most by a wide margin.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually in the coming years, according to estimates compiled by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Some estimates are much higher. Given their pivotal positions in the emerging AI industry, each of these stocks is worth a look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "With the latest round of 13F filings released over the past month, investors and market watchers alike are interested in seeing where the major hedge fund managers are finding value opportunities.\n\nBackground\n\nManagers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. These filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. For second-quarter 2024, that means managers must disclose all qualifying assets held on June 30, 2024 by Aug. 15, 2024. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs, call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts, cash positions, foreign investments and other assets are not included.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of these 13F filings to create portfolios from managers that have proven past success. Despite the 45-day delay in reporting, research has shown that investing alongside a single manager or group of managers can outperform the market. The key is to identify the best and most consistent funds to copy.\n\nThe statistics in this report are based on our Premium gurus. These gurus are our hand-picked, best-performing value investors that have proven long-term records.\n\nMagnificent 7 stocks make up large portion of the Aggregated Portfolio\n\nThe GuruFocus Aggregated Portfolio, a Premium feature based on these managers' quarterly filings, shows the 10 most broadly held stocks as of the end of the second quarter of 2024 included some Magnificent Seven names that were also popular in the previous quarter, such as software giant Microsoft Corp.

According to GuruFocus Hot Picks, that honor only goes to a handful of companies, including UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM). However, a couple of these companies also recorded a lot of selling activity over the same period, such as Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).\n\nStory continues\n\nTicker Company Buys Sells No. of Guru Owners UNH UnitedHealth Group Inc. 25 13 40 AAPL Apple Inc. 21 16 41 CVS CVS Health Corp. 19 8 26 XOM Exxon Mobil Corp. 19 9 25 MSFT Microsoft Corp. 17 39 59 AVGO Broadcom Inc. 16 11 26 COP ConocoPhillips 16 10 27 ADBE Adobe Inc. 16 11 29 GEV GE Vernova Inc. 15 13 18 TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

While Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) and Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV) are listed, they were not necessarily sold. Rather, these companies were acquired or merged with other companies and, therefore, are recorded as a sale in our database. As such, News Corp.

        "title": "Why Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Slumped on Friday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's all about the economy\n\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\n\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\n\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\n\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\n\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote –- that a recession could still occur.\n\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI opportunity\n\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\n\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\n\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\n\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards. Meta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms. Tesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity. Amazon stock is selling for less than 3 times sales, which is also an appealing price. Tesla stock is expensive no matter how you slice it, at 90 times forward earnings and 7 times sales, so it isn't for every investor.\n\nThat said, if Tesla is the first to crack the code for self-driving cars, its current valuation may end up being meaningless.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tenet Media posts still online, despite U.S. claims of Russian influence campaign",
        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK - Two days after U.S. authorities accused two employees of Russian state media network RT of coordinating an online network aimed at influencing the 2024 presidential election, nearly 4,000 posts by Tenet Media, the online content company at the heart of the case, were still accessible on TikTok, unlabeled and untouched.\n\nSo too were Tenet Media's more than 2,500 Instagram videos and more than 4,000 posts on social network X, along with its posts on Facebook and video platform Rumble, according to a Reuters review of its social media accounts.\n\nOf all the major platforms where Tenet distributed its videos, so far only Alphabet's YouTube has taken action penalizing the company, pulling down the main Tenet Media channel along with four others operated by owner Lauren Chen on Thursday.\n\nThe only other change detected by Reuters to those accounts involved an advertisement Tenet had placed on Instagram, which started running in August and was still active as of Wednesday, but was disabled by Thursday.\n\nNone of the other social media companies responded to Reuters requests for comment on how they planned to handle the posts or whether Tenet Media was in violation of their platforms' rules.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also would not clarify whether it or Tenet had removed the Instagram ad. Tenet Media likewise did not respond to a Reuters request, nor did Chen or Liam Donovan, the two people named in its incorporation records.\n\nThe platforms' apparent inaction on the campaign is a striking departure from the aggressive efforts they have touted in recent years to expose secretive foreign propaganda campaigns, reflecting both the novelty of the tactics allegedly used and the fraught politics of policing content posted by real people inside the United States.\n\nIt also exposes a fresh challenge faced by the platforms as Russia increasingly turns to unwitting American social media stars to covertly influence voters ahead of U.S. elections this year, a sort of digital update to Cold War-era practices of laundering messages through journalists or front media outlets, according to disinformation researchers.\n\n\"What we're ultimately grappling with is a problem that exists in the real world. It's manifesting on social media in the sense that the entity has a presence there, but it isn't a social media problem per se,\" said Olga Belogolova, a disinformation professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and former head of influence operations policy at Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday that two RT employees worked with foreign nationals in the United States to set up a company in Tennessee that paid prominent conservative commentators to post regular videos on topics designed to amplify political divisions in the United States.\n\nThat company paid $8.7 million to the production companies of three of the online stars it recruited and its founders received more than $760,000, according to the indictment. The commentators did not know the funding came from RT, the Justice Department said.\n\nThough the indictment did not name the company, details provided in court filings match up with Tenet Media, a Nashville-based company.\n\nThe offline nature of the alleged relationships between RT, Tenet Media and the U.S. commentators makes the case unusual in the world of online influence operations, which social media companies began cracking down on after U.S. intelligence concluded that Russia had used Facebook as part of a campaign to help former President Donald Trump win the White House in 2016.\n\nMoscow has denied that claim, as it also denied the U.S. allegations on Wednesday. RT responded to the charges with ridicule.\n\nMost major online platforms now label state-affiliated media organizations, while Meta, TikTok and YouTube owner Google all produce either monthly or quarterly reports to document their ongoing removal of coordinated networks of fake accounts.\n\nThe companies also have rules requiring users to disclose sponsorships by applying \"branded content\" and \"paid partnership\" labels to relevant posts, tools generally used by influencers paid to promote clothes, makeup and other products to their thousands of followers.\n\nMeta defines branded content as \"a creator or publisher's content that features or is influenced by a business partner for an exchange of value, such as monetary payment or free gifts,\" according to its documentation explaining the rules.\n\nTaking action against Tenet-related content, however, entails dealing with accounts that are neither fake, nor directly state-run, nor doing traditional product placements, while also wading into the thorny politics of moderating the speech of real U.S. conservative personalities.\n\nPoliticians on the right have accused social media platforms of censoring their speech. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been extending an olive branch their way, most recently in a letter to Congress last month in which he expressed regret about some of his company’s moderation decisions.\n\nBelogolova, the former Meta staffer, said social media companies would be wise to deliberate carefully before applying their rules in ways that could create dangerous precedents for legitimate speech.\n\n\"I can guarantee you, having been on the other side of something like this, that there are conversations happening right now about the policy levers that exist and what would be appropriate and inappropriate to use in this particular situation, and trying not to make snap decisions,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; editing by Diane Craft and Daniel Wallis)\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:META) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer views the current market as highly unpredictable and easily swayed by even the slightest news. He acknowledges that while some sectors are thriving, others are struggling, making it a mix of the best and worst of times depending on the industry.\n\n\"Look, this market is so ridiculous that you could knock it over with a feather or take it up with a breeze. I wanted to borrow from Charles Dickens: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" But the simple fact is that this isn't the worst of times—just the worst of times for stocks in certain industries, and the best of times for others. Or within the confines of some hideous action for the average, with the Dow sinking 626 points, the S&P plunging 2.12%, and the Nasdaq plummeting 3.26%. It was a nasty day, right into the close.\"\n\nCramer explains that a seemingly minor purchasing management report caused a widespread sell-off, particularly hitting cyclical stocks, homebuilders, and tech companies connected to AI. Despite the panic, Cramer emphasizes that these sectors, especially semiconductors, oil, and housing, are actually performing well. The sell-off, in his view, was driven by irrational fears that these strong performances won’t last.\n\n\"Now, what makes this market so ridiculous in my eyes? We had some obscure purchasing management report that threw everything off this morning, causing a wholesale collapse of the cyclicals, along with the homebuilders and anything connected to technology, particularly the once-beloved data center plays with big AI exposure. Given the chaos after that manufacturing PMI number, you'd think the semiconductor, oil, and housing worlds were in free fall. But in reality, these companies are doing incredibly well. The sellers are just worried they won't stay good for long.\"\n\nPure Stupidity\n\nHe attributes the market’s reaction to what he calls \"pure stupidity,\" combined with the typical challenges the market faces in September. This seasonal weakness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to exaggerated reactions. Cramer believes that while the economy is slowing, the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates in the coming weeks, which could benefit sectors like homebuilding.\n\n\"Frankly, I think this action represents pure stupidity, combined with the fact that the market is typically challenged in September. That's what's going on here, something that's true empirically—to the point where it can become self-fulfilling. That's how it felt today. Sure, the economy is slowing, but in a few weeks, the Fed's going to cut interest rates, and you'll wish you'd stuck with a lot of what was on sale today, like the homebuilders. They are the real winners in any move that would take down mortgage rates, which is what would happen if the Fed cuts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA Repeat of the 1999 Dot-Com Bubble?\n\nJim Cramer acknowledges that if a scenario like 1999 were to repeat, it could be disastrous for chipmakers and the tech industry surrounding AI. He respects Cembalest as one of Wall Street’s top strategists but feels his comparison to the 1990s might be too harsh. Back then, many companies were spending recklessly, but today, the company and its clients are among the most financially stable companies in history. The company faces little real competition, with no other companies close to matching its capabilities.\n\n\"A repeat of 1999 would indeed be devastating for the company and all the tech that surrounds it. As much as I think Cembalest is the best pure strategist on Wall Street—the best I've found—I found this piece a little harsh because we had many fly-by-night outfits spending like drunken sailors back in the 1990s. Now, though, the firm and its clients are some of the most well-endowed companies ever. The company doesn't have any real competition, and no one is near them by their own proclamations.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that if tech giants don’t invest now, they’ll miss out on future opportunities when they lack the necessary infrastructure. He’s proven that the company’s platform pays for itself quickly, which was not the case in 1999.\n\n\"As the company's CEO Jensen Huang has pointed out many times, if the tech titans don't spend, they're out of luck when some great use cases come along, and they don't have the infrastructure for it. Remember, Jensen has proved that the platform pays for itself very quickly. That sure wasn't the case back in 1999, was it? Of course, the company's stock has become a total pariah right now after this amazing quarter because the world suddenly seems convinced that AI spending will peak soon, at which point it's all over but the shouting. \"\n\nDespite the firm's impressive recent quarter, its stock has become unpopular, with many believing that AI spending will soon peak and that the stock's rise was overblown. Investors seem eager to push the stock back to its early August lows, around $90 after the company only delivered a major upside surprise, not the massive one they had expected.\n\n\"Stocks are getting slammed because most investors think the company's run-up was too extreme, given that the company only reported a major upside surprise—not the kind of insanely huge upside surprise they'd come to expect. The sellers are eager to take the company back to where it was trading during the last visit to the penalty box in the first week of August, with the stock ticking as low as $90 and change.\"\n\nCramer anticipates that sellers will return in force following news that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the company in an antitrust probe. However, he downplays this development, noting that such subpoenas are standard practice, questioning why the Justice Department didn’t simply ask the company some questions instead.\n\n\"I'm sure the sellers will be right back tomorrow morning after we learned tonight that the Justice Department has hit the company with a subpoena over an antitrust probe. Now, who cares? That's standard practice. It's shot first, second, and third. Though with the company right now, no one's thinking, \"Well, wait a second, why didn't the Justice Department just ask them some questions?\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article covers a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he reviewed several stocks. It highlights ten large-cap companies that he recommended and looks at how hedge funds view these stocks. The article also ranks these companies based on the level of hedge fund ownership, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nJim Cramer advises holding onto Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), noting that it remains relatively inexpensive compared to other major tech stocks, especially after recent developments with Alphabet Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:GOOG). He suggests that if Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s stock price were to drop significantly, say by 100 points, it would be a good opportunity to buy more shares.\n\n\"You’re going to hold Meta because it’s not expensive, believe it or not. It’s probably the least expensive of the mega caps, especially after what happened with Alphabet. Here’s what I would say: if it went down, let’s say 100 points, you should buy another 25 shares. I’m not advocating selling it right here because there’s too much in the pipeline that could be very good. We're on a down day, and a lot of people freak out on down days. So, stay the course.\"\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) presents a strong investment opportunity due to its leadership in social media, solid advertising revenue, and strategic focus on virtual and augmented reality. With popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a vast and engaged user base, which drives significant ad revenue. In Q2 2024, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s advertising revenue reached $32 billion, demonstrating its effective ad targeting and the strength of its core business.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investment in virtual and augmented reality, particularly through its Reality Labs division, is a major growth driver. Projects like Horizon Workrooms aim to open new revenue streams and support long-term growth. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s continuous innovation in its product offerings ensures high user engagement and helps it stay competitive in the fast-changing tech world. Financially, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is robust, with Q2 2024 revenues of $35 billion and net income of $10 billion, reflecting its strong profitability and ability to invest in future opportunities.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks you need to know. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Aside From Nvidia, There Is 1 Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Stands Above the Rest. The Reason Why May Surprise You.",
        "content": "It seems everyone wants to talk about the \"Magnificent Seven.\" They're seven of the largest and most important stocks around: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla.\n\nThey've all, in their own ways, been excellent stocks to own. However, over the last 20 months, two have separated themselves from the pack. One is Nvidia; the other might come as a surprise. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven performed since 2023\n\nFirst, let's cover how the Magnificent Seven stocks have performed since the start of 2023. Given the absolute explosion in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) systems over the last few years, it's no surprise that Nvidia is the top-performing stock in the Magnificent Seven. However, it might be a surprise to see how far ahead Meta Platforms is, compared to the rest. META Total Return Level Chart\n\nSetting Nvidia to the side, Meta has dominated the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Over the last 20 months, shares of Meta increased by 334%. That's about 3 times as much as Amazon, the next best Mag 7 stock, with a gain of 113%.\n\nSo, what's driving this divergence between Meta and the rest of the Magnificent Seven?\n\nWhat does Meta have that the rest lack?\n\nFor starters, let's cover what Meta does and how it makes money. The company operates social networks like Facebook and Instagram. It sells ad space on those platforms to advertisers, generating about $150 billion per year in revenue.\n\nThat contrasts with most of the other companies in the Magnificent Seven. Apple, for example, relies on iPhone sales and, to a lesser extent, services revenue. Microsoft is a technology conglomerate with a large cloud services business, an iconic software segment, and a large gaming unit. Amazon operates the world's largest cloud services provider, along with a massive e-commerce segment. Tesla sells electric vehicles.\n\nOnly Alphabet operates in the same orbit as Meta with its Google Search and YouTube businesses. Yet, even with Alphabet, there are significant differences. Alphabet makes a ton of money from ad revenue, but it makes it by selling ads through its search functionality, rather than through a social media feed like Facebook or Instagram.\n\nThe big difference, however, emerges when you look at a very important metric: free cash flow. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nAs you can see above, both Alphabet and Meta expanded their free cash flow in impressive fashion over the last 10 years. Yet, over the last 18 months, Meta has truly separated itself. There are a few reasons for that.\n\nFirst, Meta is growing at a breakneck pace. In its most recent quarter (the three months ended June 30), Meta reported revenue growth of 22%. That's nearly double the pace of Alphabet, which grew at 13% over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, Meta is scaling back some expensive projects. Spending on the company's Reality Labs, the segment tasked with building the company's version of the metaverse, is set to fall by around 20% this year.\n\nFinally, setting aside its revenue growth and cost-cutting, Meta's business is justextremely profitable. As shown below, it ranks third among Mag 7 businesses, behind Nvidia and Microsoft. META Operating Margin (Quarterly) ChartMETA Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nIs Meta Platforms still a buy now?\n\nGranted, Meta Platforms isn't a stock for every investment portfolio. While the stock now pays a dividend, the stock's 0.4% dividend yield is hardly enough to satisfy value investors or those who need to generate significant sums of income from their investments. Nevertheless, Meta is an excellent stock -- particularly for investors who can hold the stock for years and benefit from its growing sales and free cash flow. For those reasons, Meta is an excellent stock that most investors should strongly consider.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\n\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Latest reports suggest that Meta will inform users in Brazil how it will use their personal data to train generative AI models. The move came after authorities in the South American country suspended the new privacy laws of Meta over the use of personal data to train generative AI models. The disclosures will enable Meta to continue to offer generative AI tools to users.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest firms in the world. The sheer scale of the firm is better understood by looking at daily active user numbers released by the company in the second quarter results. Meta hit 3.2 billion daily active users between March and June this year, with WhatsApp reaching 100 million monthly US users. The family of apps offered by the firm grew revenue by 22% annually in Q2 2024, driven by more than $38 billion in ad revenue.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nDespite the significant growth and investor interest in artificial intelligence stocks, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday the sector is not in a speculative bubble, unlike previous technology booms such as the late 1990s internet bubble.\n\nYet the analysts highlight the importance of diversification given the high concentration risk among leading tech companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe extraordinary performance of tech stocks in recent years has been justified by their earnings, said Goldman stategist Peter Oppenheimer.\n\nGlobal tech earnings per share have risen by approximately 400% since the global financial crisis, while non-tech sectors achieved a comparatively modest 25% increase, he said.\n\n“The technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to continue to dominate returns,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nTech Valuations Remain Reasonable: Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs highlights a key difference between the AI-driven rally and previous market bubbles.\n\nThe valuations of major tech players are significantly lower than those of tech stocks during past speculative phases.\n\nFor instance, while the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — account for over 30% of the S&P 500's market weight (compared to 19% for tech giants in the 2000s), they trade at nearly half the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seen in the prior dot-com bubble.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($bn) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Apple 7.3 3,387 26.5 7.7 Microsoft 6.6 3,043 25.7 9.4 NVIDIA 5.7 2,649 24.1 13.2 Amazon 4.0 1,850 25.4 2.5 Alphabet 3.9 1,808 16.6 2.0 Meta Platforms 2.4 1,118 19.2 5.5 Tesla 1.4 672 55.4 4.9 Magnificent 7 31.3 14,527 23.9 5.0\n\nIn contrast, tech giants during the 2000s dot-com bubble were trading at much higher multiples. Cisco Systems, for example, had a forward P/E of 101.7, while Intel‘s was 42.1, significantly inflating their valuations relative to the broader market.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($B) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Microsoft 4.5 581 53.2 19.2 Cisco Systems 4.2 543 101.7 17.5 Intel 3.6 465 42.1 N/A Oracle 1.9 245 84.6 N/A IBM 1.7 218 23.5 28 Lucent Technologies 1.6 206 37.9 N/A Nortel Networks 1.5 199 86.4 N/A 2000 Bubble Leaders 19.0 2,457 52.0 N/A\n\nDiversification: Key To Reduce Major Volatility Events\n\nThe Goldman Sachs equity team is flagging the concentration risks that come with this tech dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a few stocks dominate market returns, the potential for “stock-specific mistakes” increases, exposing the broader market to severe corrections, Oppenheimer said. For instance, before the July market correction, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 50% of the S&P 500's total returns for the year.\n\n“A market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation,” he said.\n\nA risk also exists that heightened competition and new entrants into the AI space could compress margins and slow growth for the market leaders.\n\nGoldman Sachs recommends seeking opportunities beyond the tech behemoths, particularly in smaller tech companies and sectors tied to infrastructure spending, which may benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe growth of infrastructure capex could boost old-economy industries that incorporate AI technologies into their operations, the firm said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Could Face Major Swings Under Harris Or Trump Tax Plans, Goldman Sachs Warns\n\nPhoto via Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\n\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "content": "Nvidia's Future Tied to LLMs and Gaming, Despite AI Capex Skepticism, Remains a Sector Favorite: Analyst\n\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a Buy rating on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $165.\n\nThe price target reflects 42x calendar 2025E PE ex-cash, within Nvidia’s historical 21x-67x forward-year PE range, which Arya noted as justified given more robust growth opportunities ahead as gaming cycle troughs and data center demand potentially face robust and long-term demand dynamics.\n\nNvidia remains a top sector pick despite fundamental headwinds, including the Blackwell delay, gross margin pressure, and regulatory headwinds like a potential DOJ probe that could suppress the stock.\n\nArya also flagged perceptional headwinds, including competition, AI monetization, cloud capex, and market headwinds like weak September seasonality, interest rate, and elections.\n\nHowever, the headwinds could also create an enhanced Buy opportunity, with the stock ~27x calendar year 2025 PE within the lowest quartile of valuation in the past five years versus the median 36x PE.\n\nArya noted that the critical fundamental recovery catalyst will likely be supply chain data points over the next several weeks, confirming the readiness of new Blackwell product shipments.\n\nArya maintained skepticism about AI capex and monetization being understandable but fruitless endeavors at least until 2026. The analyst noted that AI capex is not just driving new business opportunities; it’s also critical in protecting existing moats and large profit pools in search, social, and enterprise workloads.\n\nThe tech industry will give itself at least another one to two years of intense buildout of the Nvidia Blackwell chip with its 4x list in AI training and 25x+ list in inference, Arya writes.\n\nThe industry’s real capability will only come out with next-gen large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT-5 and Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 4, as per the analyst.\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock traded up 0.63% at $106.88 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for NVDA\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Goldman Sachs Reinstates Neutral Feb 2022 Summit Insights Group Downgrades Buy Hold Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for NVDA\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Nvidia's Future Tied to LLMs and Gaming, Despite AI Capex Skepticism, Remains a Sector Favorite: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "With Musk's X banned in Brazil, its users carve out new digital homes",
        "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — As billionaire Elon Musk's clash with a Brazilian Supreme Court justice came to a head last week, there were legal twists, insults, ultimatums, defiance and then, finally, capitulation. When the digital dust settled, X had become an ex.\n\nMusk's social media platform was banned nationwide and Justice Alexandre de Moraes set a whopping $9,000 daily fine for anyone using a virtual private network (VPN) to skirt the suspension. Brazil's X users, left casting about for a new platform, mostly started washing up on Threads and Bluesky.\n\n“Hello literally everyone in Brazil,” Shauna Wright posted on Threads the day de Moraes ordered X’s suspension.\n\nEveryone hadn't been on X; Brazil’s social masses are primarily on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. But X had outsize influence in terms of newsmakers, agenda setting and thought leaders. It was the local battleground of the global culture war and the peanut gallery for soccer games and reality shows, especially Big Brother. So as X went dark in this highly online country of 213 million, its users started migrating.\n\nWright's post was an in-joke for fellow former employees of the company then known as Twitter, and an homage to its award-winning post when Meta’s Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp all went down in 2021, sending users flocking to Twitter for info. But Wright also intended her throwback as a genuine greeting to all the friendly Brazilians.\n\n“It took off even among those who didn't get the reference, but they didn’t have to!” Wright, a content designer who posts as “goldengateblond”, told the Associated Press from San Francisco. “I was glad it made people feel welcome.”\n\nMeta launched Threads last year amid widespread backlash to Musk's 2022 purchase of Twitter and his upending many of its policies and features — from content moderation to its user verification system.\n\nOpening a Threads account was seamless for Instagram users, so it scaled rapidly; it had 175 million monthly users globally as of July, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced. Meta declined to provide specifics on Brazilian users.\n\nMore Brazilians went to Bluesky, a lesser-known platform that not only looks and feels very much like the former Twitter, but also grew out of it. The pet project of former CEO Jack Dorsey was supposed to replace it eventually. Whether it can remains to be seen, but Brazilians have started doing their part. Bluesky gained 2.6 million users since last week, 85% from Brazil, the company said Wednesday, boosting its total to over 8 million.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Good morning everyone,” Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva posted Sunday on Bluesky and Threads. “What do you think of it here?”\n\n“Our mental health is already showing signs of improvement,” Tatiane Queiroz, 43, replied on Bluesky, where she describes herself as a “Twitter refugee in Mato Grosso,\" a state in Brazilian farm country.\n\nBluesky has been posting in Portuguese to get Brazilians situated and find those with whom they previously shared connections. They celebrated Wednesday as TV network Globo's evening news program, which gets over 20 million viewers, presented its new Bluesky account on air. Pioneers with prior footholds are giving tips and sharing so-called “starter packs” of accounts to follow.\n\nJefferson Nascimento, a human rights lawyer in Sao Paulo, has created 10 starter packs to help newbies navigate.\n\n“In some way, to strengthen the environment, make the environment more favorable for other people to go there, so that when Twitter (X) comes back — if it does come back at some point — there isn't a mass stampede again,” said Nascimento, 42, whose follower count on X was 135,000, more than triple his Bluesky amount.\n\nSome compared Bluesky to the halcyon days of early-2010s Twitter. Egerton Neto, 30, opened his Bluesky account on the day of X's shutdown. He has just 8 followers — far below his 252 on X — but appreciates Bluesky's more peaceful discourse and less intentional addictiveness. He said by phone from Recife that he also likes seeing its developers interact with the community as they build the platform.\n\nStarting over from scratch online is a bit of déjà vu for Brazilians — at least millenials. They were early adopters of Google’s former social network Orkut and dominated the platform before its 2014 shutdown. They migrated en masse to Facebook.\n\nBluesky's CEO Jay Graber told the AP on Monday that this wave of Brazilians underscores one of its missions: allowing users to move platforms and keep connections, similar to switching cell phone carriers without losing your number or contacts.\n\nOn established social networks like TikTok or Facebook, users can only interact with people on the same platform. There’s no interoperability. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models. Bluesky is building the technical foundation — what it calls “a protocol for public conversation” — that could make networks work more like email, blogs or phone numbers.\n\n“The situation users are in today is a bit of a trap because users are locked in and developers are locked out of these social platforms. And then that means that you’re essentially stuck in a place where it should be offering you a service, but now it’s owning your entire social life,\" Graber said. \"One of the fundamental things we believe is that a user’s social relationships, like their social graph, their connections to their friends, should be something that they own.”\n\nX had 22 million users in Brazil, according to estimates in the Digital 2024: Brazil report, just one-sixth the number on Instagram, and about one-fifth of Facebook or TikTok. But skimpy figures bely its importance as a gathering place for journalists, politicians, academics and celebrities whose interactions resounded far beyond, according to David Nemer, who specializes in the anthropology of technology at the University of Virginia.\n\n“Even though Twitter may not have this direct impact on the everyday, common Brazilians, it would impact the press, which eventually would impact indirectly common Brazilians,” said Nemer, who is Brazilian. “That’s the sort of impact that Twitter has — or used to have — in Brazil.”\n\nAccording to data from research firm Similarweb, X was Brazil's fourth-most downloaded social media app from the Google Play store the day before its suspension; Bluesky has since surpassed it. On Apple's app store, Bluesky became the top downloaded app of any type, social media or otherwise. Bluesky saw daily active Brazilian users reach 3.4 million on Aug. 30, the day de Moraes ordered the shutdown, versus X's 6.1 million that day.\n\nSimilarweb data also showed many Brazilians using VPNs to stay on X. Nemer said that from his home in Charlottesville he has seen some far-right politicians brazenly posting and defying Brazil's Supreme Court to levy its exorbitant fine.\n\nBut most Brazilians have gone, and there were those on X lamenting their departure.\n\n\"Losing Brazil is like ‘Sex and the City’ losing Samantha. You’re losing all the best one-liners and the sexual energy that makes the platform/show tick,” posted Sam Stryker, who until 2022 oversaw Twitter's global branded entertainment channels — even operating Twitter's Twitter account.\n\nAnd Brazilian X users who emigrated were settling into their new digital abodes, like columnist and internet personality Chico Barney.\n\n\"Bluesky as a post-Twitter refuge proving once and for all that it doesn't matter the place, but the people,\" he wrote Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nOrtutay reported from San Francisco\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tech stocks have been going through a rout as fears of a US recession sparked a Wall Street sell-off that wiped $279bn of Nvidia (NVDA) alone in one single day. Despite the ongoing volatility, UBS (UBS) is advising investors to see this as a strategic moment to refine their technology portfolios — whether by making selective purchases or offloading certain assets.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, recommends investors assess their portfolio’s technology and AI exposure.\n\nThose with lower AI allocations might consider building exposure through structured strategies to navigate potential volatility, while those with higher allocations could explore capital preservation strategies as a hedge against further market turbulence.\n\n“Semiconductor capital expenditure remains promising,” Haefele noted, though he acknowledged that some areas of the industry are more appealing than others. Nvidia's recent earnings, which exceeded consensus estimates but fell short of loftier expectations, sent mixed signals to investors.\n\nRead more: BP and L&G shares favourite among Fidelity investors as tech appetite fades\n\nHowever, Haefele pointed out that the broader semiconductor sector could find support in the coming quarters due to robust order books and an expected increase in AI-related capital expenditures, which, despite their recent growth, are still below historical peaks.\n\nUBS suggests a targeted approach within the semiconductor space, prioritising AI logic chips where valuations have become more reasonable. Quality foundry stocks also appear attractive, with UBS expecting sustained earnings growth.\n\nAt the other end of the sector, memory chip stocks, which are typically more volatile, may struggle in the current market and face heightened regulatory risks from the US. Chip manufacturing equipment makers, heavily reliant on revenue from China, are seen as the most vulnerable in the near term due to increasing export restrictions.\n\nLooking beyond semiconductors, UBS sees potential in quality large-cap technology companies, particularly those that are beginning to show returns from AI investments. While sentiment around large-cap tech has softened, second-quarter results were solid, and global tech earnings growth is projected to reach 15% to 20% over the next six quarters.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are leading the way in AI monetisation, with Microsoft anticipating faster cloud revenue growth and Meta aligning its investments with substantial monetisation opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Investors buying the dip as Wall Street rout makes stocks cheaper\n\nValuations for mega-cap tech stocks have also become more attractive, currently trading at around 27 times next year’s earnings — approximately 15% below their recent peaks. UBS maintains a preference for quality tech companies with strong secular growth and resilient earnings, supported by solid fundamentals and robust free cash flow.\n\nIn the smartphone sector, supply chains may see a boost from the upcoming replacement cycle. Apple (AAPL), in particular, has shown relative resilience, with its shares holding up well ahead of the seasonal iPhone launch. UBS notes that supply chain checks suggest a launch preparation in line with last year, with the potential for a 5% to 10% increase in orders if demand is strong.\n\nUBS favours companies within the smartphone supply chain that have pricing power and industry leadership while remaining cautious on lower-quality hardware firms that could face margin pressures.\n\nUBS says that tech volatility is likely to persist in the near term but remains confident in the long-term investment case for AI.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Israel accuses Facebook oversight board of endorsing ‘genocidal rallying cry’",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg\n\nIsrael has accused Facebook’s oversight board of “endorsing a genocidal rallying cry” by ruling that the phrase “from the river to the sea” did not always glorify Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli ministry of foreign affairs alleged that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was “complicit in fostering a toxic and dangerous environment for Jewish users online” after it refused to take down posts featuring the Gaza protest slogan.\n\nResponding to the decision, David Saranga, the acting deputy director general for public diplomacy at the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs, said: “‘From the river to the sea’ is not merely a slogan – it is a genocidal rallying cry aimed at erasing Israel from the map.\n\n“Has Meta’s oversight board even paused to consider the dangerous rhetoric it is endorsing by permitting this hate speech to spread on its platform? At a time when anti-Semitism and violence against Jews have surged to levels not seen since the Holocaust, Meta has a responsibility to stamp out this hatred – not to let it proliferate.\n\n“We hope Meta will take responsibility for this grave mistake and reverse their decision.”\n\nMeta had declined to block three posts which included the phrase, which critics argue is anti-Semitic and implies the destruction of the state of Israel.\n\nUsers appealed against the ruling to the tech giant’s oversight board, a review panel that includes luminaries such as Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor.\n\nHowever, the board on Wednesday ruled that the phrase was “not by itself ... harmful, violent or discriminatory”. It added the posts in question “did not glorify Hamas”.\n\nIn its decision, the board said that the slogan – a shortened version of “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – was “often used as a political call for solidarity, equal rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people and to end the war in Gaza”.\n\nThe phrase is commonly used in protests calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. According to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its invasion in response to Hamas’s Oct 7 terror attack.\n\nThe board admitted, however, that it was “understood by some” as legitimising anti-Semitism. The phrase was used in a version of Hamas’s charter.\n\nIt said that a default block on the phrase by the tech giant would “hinder protected political speech in unacceptable ways”.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly clashed with tech giants over their handling of the conflict after videos of massacres spread rapidly online in the wake of the Oct 7 attacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Meta spokesman said: “We welcome the board’s review of our guidance on this matter. While all of our policies are developed with safety in mind, we know they come with global challenges and we regularly seek input from experts outside Meta, including the oversight board.”\n\nAn oversight board spokesman said: “These issues must be treated extremely seriously, which is why the oversight board considered a broad range of views and information. These are documented in its nuanced decision.”\n\nThe oversight board said the decision should be read in full.",

        "title": "Meta oversight panel says political content cuts could limit dissent in crises including Venezuela's",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Meta’s efforts to scale back political content on its platforms could limit the reach of people’s expressions of dissent or awareness during crises, including Venezuela’s post-election situation, the company’s oversight panel said Thursday in a decision on cases involving videos taken after the July vote in the South American country.\n\nThe quasi-independent Oversight Board urged the social media giant to apply an existing protocol for crisis situations “to ensure that political content during crises can have the same reach as other types of content.”\n\nThe decision came as the company clamps down on the amount of news and political content users see following years of criticism about how it handles misinformation  and whether it contributes to political polarization.\n\nMeta set up the board in 2020 to be a referee for content on its platforms including Facebook and Instagram. The company referred to the board two videos related to pro-government armed groups, known in Venezuela as “colectivos,” that were posted after the July 28 presidential election, whose official result prompted protests across the country.\n\nOne of the videos, posted to Instagram, shows a group of armed men on motorcycles pulling up to an apartment complex. A woman can be heard shouting in Spanish that the “colectivos” were trying to access a building, while the person taking the video can be heard yelling in the same language “Go to hell! I hope they kill you all!”\n\nMeta determined the video did not violate its policies because “the expression was a conditional or aspirational statement against a violent actor rather than a call to action,” according to the decision. The board agreed with the company.\n\nThe other video reviewed by the Oversight Board was posted on Facebook. It shows people running and a group of men, presumed to be “colectivos” riding motorcycles. The man who filmed the video can be heard saying the group is attacking the people on the street. The caption in Spanish accompanying the post criticizes the government’s security forces for not defending people from the violent, ruling-party loyal gangs and calls on the state’s forces to “kill those damn colectivos.”\n\nMeta took down the video for representing “a call to action to commit high-severity violence,” according to the decision. The board disagreed, finding that it is similar to the Instagram post and, in Venezuela’s current context, “understood as an aspirational statement.”\n\n“The Board acknowledges Meta’s concern that allowing this type of expression could contribute to a heightened risk of offline violence in an ongoing crisis,” according to the decision. “However, given the specific context of Venezuela, in which widespread repression and violence is carried out by state forces jointly with colectivos, and where there are strong restrictions on people’s rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, it is fundamental to allow people to freely express their dissent, anger or desperation, even resorting to strong language.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThousands of people, including minors, took to the streets across Venezuela hours after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared President Nicolás Maduro the winner of the July 28 election. The protests were largely peaceful, but demonstrators also toppled statues of Maduro’s predecessor, the late leader Hugo Chávez, threw rocks at law enforcement officers and buildings, and burned police motorcycles and government propaganda.\n\nMaduro and his ruling party allies, who control all aspects of government, responded to the demonstrations with full force. A Wednesday report from Human Rights Watch implicated Venezuelan security forces and “colectivos” in some of the 24 deaths that occurred during the protests.\n\nWhile the National Electoral Council declared Maduro's victory, it never released vote tallies backing their claim. However, the main opposition coalition claimed that its candidate, former diplomat Edmundo González, defeated Maduro by a 2-to-1 margin and offered as proof vote tallies from more than 80% of the electronic voting machines used in the election.\n\nMeta, then called Facebook, launched the Oversight Board in 2020 in response to criticism that it was not moving fast enough to remove misinformation, hate speech and influence campaigns from its platforms. The board has 21 members, a multinational group that includes legal scholars, human rights experts and journalists.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) the Best Augmented Reality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n\nAR/VR Startups\n\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\n\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that  positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAugmented Reality Market & Outlook\n\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\n\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pokémon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made a significant shift towards the metaverse, VR, and AR technologies in recent years. The company has ambitious plans in these areas, including the development of smart glasses, Quest headsets, and smartwatches. However, Reality Labs, Meta's division dedicated to VR and augmented reality innovations, has faced scrutiny due to its substantial financial investment in these emerging consumer platforms.\n\nDespite these concerns, BofA Securities has maintained a Buy rating for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), with an unchanged price target of $550. This comes after reports suggested that Meta plans to reduce its investment in Reality Labs' hardware by about 20% through 2026. While Meta has not officially confirmed these budget adjustments, the potential cuts are viewed as a strategic response to the lukewarm reception of VR devices in the market, though there is a renewed interest in AR glasses.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported a stronger-than-expected profit of $13.5 billion for the most recent quarter, boosting its shares by nearly 7%. Revenue for the April-June period reached $39 billion, surpassing market expectations and marking a 22% increase year-over-year. The California-based tech giant forecasts third-quarter revenue between $38.5 billion and $41 billion.\n\nAt the end of Q2 2024, 219 investors reported holding positions in META, with total stakes valued at $42.5 billion, a notable decrease from $46.9 billion in the previous quarter.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts’ estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.”\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): An AI Stock That Broke The Internet This Week",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\n\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug​.\n\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon’s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company’s total sales​. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure​. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. A few weeks after announcing that spending on AI and related technologies would increase in the coming months, the company has now disclosed plans to close its augmented reality (AR) studio to redirect investments elsewhere. In a recent statement, the firm explained that this move is part of a broader strategy to allocate resources toward the next generation of experiences, focusing on emerging form factors like smart glasses.\n\nEarlier this week, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) revealed that it had entered into an agreement with Sage Geosystems to procure geothermal energy for its AI data centers in the US. The first phase of this project is expected to be operational by 2027. Meta has committed to investing in sustainable energy sources as power demand surges across the country, having already secured over 12,000 MW in renewable energy projects in recent years.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The malaise has spread beyond the U.S.: Japan’s Nikkei 225, the Stoxx Europe 600 and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index all tumbled on Tuesday.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Oversight Board said on Wednesday the Facebook parent should not automatically remove a phrase seen by some as displaying solidarity with Palestinians and by others as an endorsement of violence against Jews.\n\nThe board, which operates independently but is funded by the U.S. social media firm, said the phrase \"From the river to the sea\" has several meanings, and as such its use cannot in itself be deemed to be harmful, violent or discriminatory.\n\nThe phrase refers to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, between which lie Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is often chanted at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nCritics of the phrase say it is antisemitic and a call for Israel's eradication. Other groups dispute that interpretation.\n\n\"Context is crucial,\" said Oversight Board co-chair Pamela San Martin. \"Simply removing political speech is not a solution. There needs to be room for debate, especially during times of crisis and conflict.\"\n\nThe Oversight Board said it came to the conclusion after it had reviewed three cases involving content posted on Facebook by different users containing the phrase.\n\n\"We welcome the board's review of our guidance on this matter,\" Meta said in a statement. \"While all of our policies are developed with safety in mind, we know they come with global challenges and we regularly seek input from experts outside Meta, including the Oversight Board.\"\n\nAlex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University that promotes free speech, called the decision by the board \"thoughtful (and in my opinion, correct).\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, said the decision was \"short-sighted.\"\n\n\"Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized,\" it said.\n\nThe board also called on Meta to improve access to data for journalists and researchers, less than a month after Meta discontinued CrowdTangle, a tool widely used to check misinformation and conduct research on content on Meta's platforms, including Instagram.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "META Seems to Lose Some Shine: Is the Stock Suffering From AI Fatigue?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms META shares have returned 7.6% in the past month, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 9.7% and the Zacks Internet Software industry’s appreciation of 12.5%. Except for Amazon AMZN, it has outperformed the rest of “Magnificent 7” over the same time frame.\r\n\r\nThe social media giant seems to have lost some shine in recent times, which can be attributed to increasing AI fatigue among investors. Technology stocks, including META, have been benefiting from a strong AI-fueled rally, which, however, seems to be losing steam due to rising weariness and skepticism over AI’s continuous hype and promises.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Magnificent 7 group, which includes Google and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple and Tesla TSLA apart from Amazon and META, is facing headwinds from the cooling-off in AI-fueled rally.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises for investors - are META’s AI initiatives good enough to drive share price higher in the rest of this year? Let’s analyze.\n\nMETA’s Data Trove Makes the Stock an AI Behemoth\n\nAI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove driven by its more than 3.2 billion daily users. Meta Platforms has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook.\r\n\r\nIts staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 10% year over year in second-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Alphabet.\r\n\r\nMETA’s advertising revenues (99% of Family of Apps revenues) increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion and accounted for 97.9% of second-quarter revenues. At constant currency, revenues increased 23% year over year.\n\nMETA Underperforms Sector in the Past Month Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIncreasing Regulatory Concern: A Headwind for the META Stock\n\nMETA is facing regulatory issues related to data privacy and security globally. Its business model relies on the collection, storage and utilization of vast amounts of personal data that raises questions about consent and transparency. Increasing regulatory headwinds have been a constant bother for META investors.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is aggressively spending on developing AI infrastructure and now expects to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on these efforts in 2024. This should not be a concern for investors given its strong cash balance of $58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill META’s AI Initiatives Aid Prospects?\n\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults (18-29-year-olds), a demography that used to prefer Alphabet’s YouTube and Snapchat. META is incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented. \r\n\r\nIt has started rolling out Meta AI and is on track to achieve its goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. Meta AI is currently available in more than 20 countries and eight languages. In the United States, Meta Platforms is rolling out new features like Imagine edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.\r\n\r\nMETA’s Llama family of foundation models has been a game changer. The latest Llama 3.1 includes the first frontier-level open-source model, as well as new and industry-leading small and medium-sized models. It is already working on Llama 4, which is expected to boost META’s capability in the long run.\n\nMETA’s Estimate Revision Shows Upward Movement\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $21.23 per share, up 3.3% over the past 30 days, indicating a 42.77% year-over-year increase.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.12 per share, up 5.3% over the past 30 days, indicating a 16.63% year-over-year increase.\n\nMETA Stock Overvalued\n\nHowever, META stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, META is trading at 7.32X, higher than its median of 7.08X and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 2.52X.\n\nP/S Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nMETA’s growing footprint among young adults driven by improving recommendations boosts competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers that is expected to drive top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, monetization of its AI services is expected to take several years, which investors should keep in mind before investing. Rising regulatory concern is a significant concern.\r\n\r\nMETA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg\n\nFacebook posts containing the phrase “from the river to the sea” did not always glorify Hamas and should be allowed to remain online, the company’s oversight board has ruled.\n\nThe body – which includes Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor – said the slogan should not be “automatically removed” by technology giant Meta’s moderators.\n\nHate speech campaigners have condemned the slogan – a shortened version of “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” – as anti-Semitic because they claimed it implied the destruction of the state of Israel. “From the river to the sea” has been adopted by Hamas and is used in the terror group’s official charter.\n\nHowever, the Facebook panel, whose members also include Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the former prime minister of Denmark, said the phrase “by itself and regardless of context” should not necessarily be “understood as harmful, violent or discriminatory”.\n\nPamela San Martin, the board’s co-chairman, said: “There has been an unacceptable and deeply disturbing rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia on and offline. But context is crucial. Simply removing political speech is not a solution. There needs to be room for debate, especially during times of crisis.”\n\nThe board ruled that three posts which had included the phrase should not be taken down and did “not glorify Hamas”.\n\nUsers had appealed to the oversight board after Meta originally refused to remove the posts. One of the posts condemned the “senseless slaughter” in Gaza by the “Zionist state of Israel”.\n\nIn its decision, the board said while the phrase “can be understood by some as encouraging and legitimising anti-Semitism and the violent elimination of Israel and its people, it is also often used as a political call for solidarity, equal rights and self-determination of the Palestinian people and to end the war in Gaza”.\n\nThe board added that since the phrase had different meanings in different contexts, a blanket ban would “hinder protected political speech in unacceptable ways”.\n\nWhile the majority of the board ruled Meta had acted correctly, a minority of its members argued the technology giant should “adopt a default rule presuming the phrase constitutes glorification” of Hamas or its massacre of Israelis on Oct 7. The votes of individual members were not disclosed.\n\nMeta included Hamas on a list of dangerous organisations in its moderation rules. It upgraded Hamas to a “tier one” group in December, barring praise and legitimisation of the terror organisation.",

Looking ahead, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, chaining together consecutive periods of positivity.\n\nSeveral companies have stolen the spotlight throughout the period, including Meta Platforms, Lockheed Martin and Eli Lilly.

The company's earnings outlook reflects bullishness across all timeframes.\n\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, 'We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\"\n\nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\n\nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\n\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 22.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nEli Lilly Sees Robust Demand\n\nEli Lilly shares have been red-hot in 2024 thanks to robust results stemming from unrelenting demand, up 65% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Shares popped following its latest release, with earnings and sales climbing 85% and 35%, respectively.\n\nThe company upgraded its current-year sales guidance by a sizable $3 billion. Analysts have adjusted their sales expectations accordingly, with the now $46.4 billion expected alluding to a 35% climb year-over-year.\n\nThe story behind Eli Lilly has been driven by its diabetes drug Mounjaro and its weight loss injection Zepbound, which have seen unrelenting demand among consumers. Mounjaro sales jumped 216% year-over-year, whereas Zepbound sales of $1.2 billion also reflected strong demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings expectations have shot higher across the board following the release, with LLY sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLMT Generates Significant Cash\n\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology. The company's steady growth continued throughout its latest period, with EPS and revenue growing 6% and 9%, respectively.\n\nThe company has been a long-time favorite among income-focused investors, consistently upping its payout over the years. LMT's cash-generating abilities have aided its dividend growth, with the company posting nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nFollowing the favorable quarter, LMT upped its EPS, segment profit, and sales guidance, causing shares to move bullishly following the release.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Q2 earnings season overall showed resiliency, with no major spooks hitting the tape. While we saw some mixed reads on the consumer, recent favorable economic data helps alleviate this issue.\n\nAnd concerning a few companies who stole the spotlight during the reporting period, these three stocks all did precisely that.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Social media giant Meta Platforms will inform Brazilians how it intends to use their personal data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI), it said on Tuesday, following a demand from the country's data protection watchdog.\n\nMeta's users in Brazil will receive the warnings starting on Tuesday by email and notifications on Facebook and Instagram, and will be able to reject the use of their data by the firm to train generative AI, it said in a statement.\n\nBrazil's National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) in July suspended Meta's new privacy policy over the use of personal data to train AI, but overturned this last Friday saying Meta had agreed to issue the disclosures.\n\nIn July, Meta also actively suspended the use of generative AI tools in Brazil, which included tools used to create popular AI-made stickers for messaging platform WhatsApp. Brazil is WhatsApp's second-largest customer base.\n\nAt the time, Meta said it had decided to suspend the tools while it was in talks with ANPD to address the authority's doubts over its use of generative AI.\n\nAsked by Reuters on Tuesday if it would resume the tools after ANPD lifted the suspension, Meta only reaffirmed that the suspension had been issued while it was in talks with the ANPD.\n\n(Reporting by Paula Arend Laier and Andre Romani in Sao Paulo; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Kamala Harris's small business plan: A tenfold expansion of a key tax credit",
        "content": "Kamala Harris will announce a new policy proposal Wednesday for a $50,000 tax credit for small businesses looking to get off the ground.\n\nAt the center of her new plan is the small business tax deduction currently in the tax code that allows would-be entrepreneurs to deduct up to $5,000 for things like business start-up costs.\n\nThe proposal from Harris would increase that tenfold — and will be formally announced on Wednesday with the vice president set to further outline her economic ideas during a stop in Portsmouth, N.H.\n\nShe will also unveil an overall goal of triggering 25 million new small business applications over the next four years.\n\nHarris is also set to propose additional measures Wednesday around things like reducing red tape for small businesses. Tomorrow's rollout also comes ahead of next week's highly anticipated debate with former President Donald Trump where economic worries are likely to be top of mind. Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event in Pittsburgh with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n\"One of my singular priorities is to invest and grow our small businesses,\" Harris said at a campaign stop last week.\n\nThe latest rollout from the Harris campaign is a clear effort to appeal to business-minded voters. She is attempting to ally herself with smaller businesses while sometimes assailing bigger ones.\n\n\"We will continue to build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations,\" Harris added Monday during a Labor Day stop in Pittsburgh.\n\nA potential for widespread appeal\n\nFor his part, Donald Trump often points to his own business record as president as a reason for voters to choose him. He also charges that a potential Harris administration would be cataclysmic for small businesses and has even taken to calling her \"Comrade Kamala\" in recent weeks.\n\nBut the Harris/Walz campaign has sought to combat the charges with what is now a second economic policy plan that follows last month's release of a cost of living plan aimed at housing and grocery store prices as well as an expansion of the child tax credit.\n\nBut this week's focus on small businesses and entrepreneurs could have appeal for millions of potential voters.\n\nSmall business entrepreneurship has been on the rise in recent years, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. It found that in 2022 almost 20% of US adults were in the process of founding a business or had done so in the past 3.5 years. It was the highest reading since the survey began back in 1999.\n\nStory continues Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa., on Aug. 30. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nThe Biden White House has often touted increasing small business activity since the pandemic ended, pointing to some 19 million new small business applications during his term so far.\n\nHarris is aiming to take it further, but other measures of entrepreneurship are coming in more mixed. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index recently rose in July to 93.7 but remains below the 50-year average of 98.\n\nThis week's Harris/Walz proposal, meanwhile, is also set to include new rules they say will make it easier to start a business. The ideas to be unveiled include ways to claim this new deduction to maximize the tax impact. Also in the works are plans for reducing some of the paperwork needed for things like small business licenses.\n\nA focus on small over big businesses\n\nThis week's Harris plan could also be a selling point among crucial donors, especially parts of Silicon Valley focused on \"little tech\" startups as opposed to giant companies like Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), which have gradually lost public support in recent years amid increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators in Washington.\n\nLikewise, Harris has sought in recent weeks to position herself as a friend of small businesses and a foe, of sorts, to those bigger corporations.\n\nLast month's prices plan focused on Democratic charges that grocery store owners and corporate landlords are \"price gouging\" their customers. Harris has detailed plans to crack down on their practices.\n\nAlso this week, the Harris campaign released a new campaign ad focused on economic issues and drawing a contrast between the Harris and Trump economic plans. A keen focus for Harris is Trump's friendly relationship with corporations and his focus, as the ad's narrator said, \"on giving them tax cuts.\"\n\nTrump has often discussed lowering the federal corporate tax rate from its current level of 21% to 15%-20%. Harris is behind a plan to raise that rate to 28%.\n\nMeanwhile, there is at least one large corporation that Harris is trying to be friendly with: McDonald's (MCD). Harris often notes that she worked at the chain during a summer in college. Both she and Trump are looking to be associated with the brand, which the company says is patronized by nearly 9 in 10 Americans at least once a year.\n\nAlso potentially in the offing in the weeks ahead is a Kamala Harris plan for the \"care economy\" around issues like childcare and paid family leave. These have long been priorities for the vice president, with her campaign signaling that plans there could also be in the offing soon.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Fantastic Stocks That Could Join The S&amp;P 500 by 2025",
        "content": "Ever wondered why some stocks are in the S&P 500 and others aren't? Well, it turns outthere'sa very specific set of criteria that must be met for a stock to gain entry into the index, which will be revealed below.\n\nBut now, three Fool.com contributors will name their top stocks that could be added to the index by 2025. Let's dive right in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir meets all the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500\n\nJake Lerch (Palantir Technologies): My choice as a stock that could join the S&P 500 by next year is PalantirTechnologies(NYSE: PLTR). Palantir is the maker of an AI-powered platform that helps organizations understand complex datasets, and the company's stock is red-hot.\n\nSo far this year, Palantir stock is up a remarkable 80%. Its market cap is now $68 billion, making the AI stock America's 279th-largest public company by market cap. Yet, as of this writing, Palantir is still not a member of the S&P 500.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nIt's a good question because Palantir checks all of the boxes needed for inclusion in the S&P 500:\n\nA U.S. Company Market cap of at least $18 billion Stock is highly liquid Public float is at least 50% of total shares outstanding Positive earnings in its most recent quarter and total positive earnings in the four most recent quarters\n\nFirst off, Palantir is based in the U.S. and has a market cap of nearly $70 billion -- check.\n\nSecond, Palantir's stock is highly liquid; its public float is well over 50% of its outstanding shares available.\n\nFinally, we come to profitability. Profitability, in all likelihood, is why Palantir is not in the S&P 500. While the company has reported positive earnings in each of the last six quarters, they have been tiny profits. PLTR EPS Diluted (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs you can see above, Palantir had quarterly losses as recently as late 2022. Because of that, the committee has likely delayed putting Palantir into the S&P 500 -- waiting to see more quarters of positive earnings before giving Palantir the nod.\n\nHowever, one more quarter of positive earnings might be enough to lead to the committee adding Palantir to the index by 2025. And that's exactly what I think will happen.\n\nS&P 500 inclusion might help make this company the next great advertising stock\n\nWill Healy(The Trade Desk): Mega-cap tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have built their fortunes on digital advertising. These companies generate tens of billions in revenue every quarter by helping businesses of all sizes reach desired audiences, and that market power makes them mainstays of the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid the influence of this industry, the next advertising stock to enter the S&P 500 might just be The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). Its demand-side platform allows agencies and companies to manage digital ad campaigns, running ads in the times and places where they believe they can generate the highest returns. Additionally, with the help of AI tool Kokai, users can further refine the timing and placement of ads to derive more value.\n\nThanks to its capabilities, it has become a stock with a $50 billion market cap, far above the minimum market cap required to enter the S&P 500. From that point, its financials will likely help boost this stock further.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2024 was just under $1.1 billion, a 27% increase compared with the same period last year. The company has also recovered from an earnings slump it faced in 2022. With that, its net income was $117 million in the first six months of 2024, rising 176% compared with year-ago levels.\n\nAmid these fast-rising profits, its 205 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is likely not representative of its valuation, but its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 24 admittedly makes it expensive. Still, analysts forecast 26% revenue growth this year and 20% in 2025, meaning revenues will continue to place downward pressure on its sales multiple.\n\nFinally, investors should remember what inclusion in the index means -- a place in the portfolio of every investor who invests in the S&P 500 through index funds. That rising influence should further bolster the stock as more advertisers turn to its platform.\n\nCoinbase would give the S&P 500 exposure to cryptocurrency's potential upside.\n\nJustin Pope (Coinbase): If the S&P 500 is going to look to innovation and add AI tech companies such as CrowdStrike and Super Micro Computer into the index, it makes perfect sense to add Coinbase(NASDAQ: COIN), too. Cryptocurrencies are still hotly debated among investors, but the asset class is forcing its way into the conversation. According to research by The Motley Fool, approximately one-quarter of investors are \"very likely\" to buy at least some form of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe case for Coinbase is simple. It's a publicly traded U.S. company, making it arguably the safest exchange and crypto-finance company after fraud and controversy have tainted or destroyed private and foreign competitors like Binance and FTX.\n\nNext, it easily meets the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500; its current $42 billion market cap meets the minimum threshold. Plus, it is comfortably GAAP profitable, with almost $1.4 billion in net income over the past four quarters.\n\nMost importantly, it's a fantastic business. Coinbase's exchange is its core business, but its ambitions span the crypto economy, including financial products such as banking and payment cards that allow users to spend their crypto as dollars. Cryptocurrency can be cyclical, but Coinbase has proven it can endure the downturns. The company is also in a great financial position, with over $8 billion in cash on its balance sheet, nearly a fifth of the stock's value.\n\nCryptocurrencies must continue to gain adoption among society and investors for Coinbase's business to grow over the long term. However, there isn't a better stock for exposure to crypto's potential upside. Adding Coinbase to the S&P 500 would reflect a forward-thinking investment strategy and help lift the index higher over the coming years if cryptocurrency continues gaining steam.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Christopher Bing and Katie Paul\n\n(Reuters) - A Chinese social media influence operation is impersonating U.S. voters, denigrating U.S. politicians and pushing divisive messages ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election in the United States, new research by intelligence company Graphika showed.\n\nThe campaign is part of a known Chinese state-linked effort analysts have dubbed \"Spamouflage\" or \"Dragonbridge,\" which pushes a mixture of spam and targeted propaganda onto the internet.\n\nSpamouflage has been active since at least 2017 but has stepped up its activities as the election approaches, according to experts. It has leveraged thousands of accounts across more than 50 websites, forums and social media platforms.\n\n\"The key takeaway from this report,\" said Jack Stubbs, who manages Graphika's research team, is that Spamouflage has \"become more aggressive in its efforts to infiltrate and sway U.S. political conversations.\"\n\n\"This matters because it shows Chinese influence operations targeting the U.S. are evolving, engaging in more advanced deceptive behaviors, and directly targeting these organic but hyper-sensitive rifts in society,\" Stubbs added.\n\nIn one example highlighted by Graphika, the Chinese operation impersonated American anti-war activists. Using multiple accounts on X, the operatives created memes that labeled Trump a \"fraud,\" showing him in an orange prison uniform, and called Biden a \"coward.\"\n\nIn halting English, a different account asked: \"the present American still our America?\" Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said, \"China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.\"\n\nFacebook previously attributed the campaign to Chinese law enforcement, calling it \"the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world.\"\n\nSpamouflage's messaging does not appear to favor one side of the political spectrum – either Democrats or Republicans – but rather aims to amplify existing criticisms toward American society and government.\n\nHistorically, the group had limited success engaging with actual Americans, but that began to change in mid-2023 when the operatives increasingly targeted genuine supporters of former President Donald Trump, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which has done its own research into Spamouflage.\n\nTRACKING INFLUENCE OPERATIONS\n\nGraphika identified 15 Spamouflage accounts on social media platform X and one account on TikTok, all claiming to be U.S. citizens or media outlets. It also highlighted other profiles associated with those accounts on YouTube and Instagram that were suspended by the time it finished its report.\n\nStory continues\n\nX did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said, “The channel flagged by Graphika was previously identified and terminated as part of our investigations into coordinated influence operations, and had a very small number of views at the time it was removed.”\n\nThe Tiktok account, named Harlan Report, was among the group's most successful assets. It posted a single video in July which garnered 1.5 million views.\n\nThat video, which was removed from TikTok last week, mocked a Biden press conference at NATO's 75th anniversary summit where he stumbled over a speech. Like similar social media posts shared widely at the time, it transcribed Biden's words erroneously to suggest that he had made a sexual reference, according to a Reuters Fact Check.\n\nA Reuters review of the Harlan Report account on TikTok showed that it posted its first video in May. Other recent videos posted by the account racked up hundreds of thousands of views, including one shared last week showing CNN panelists discussing the network's interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said the company permanently banned the Harlan Report account for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed that it had removed Spamouflage activity from its platforms in two places as part of its ongoing enforcement against the operation. Neither was able to gain much traction with authentic audiences, a Meta spokesperson said.\n\nThe U.S. government is investigating foreign efforts to interfere in the election.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, released a report on election interference, noting that China was \"approaching this U.S. presidential election more cautiously ... and probably does not plan to influence the outcome.\" However, \"we are tracking efforts to influence the U.S. public more broadly.\"\n\n(Reporting by Christopher Bing and Katie Paul; Additional reporting by Sheila Dang and Kenrick Cai; Editing by Stephen Coates and Mark Porter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should Nvidia Investors Worry About Its Declining Gross Margin?",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) sold off after the company's recent earnings report and are now down about 11% from their all-time high.\n\nNvidia is still posting excellent growth, with revenue up 122% in the quarter, ahead of analyst expectations. But with the stock exceeding a $3 trillion market cap and expectations extremely high, Nvidia sold off anyway following the release.\n\nOne reasons could be concern over the company's gross margin. Here's what happened with this all-important metric last quarter, and whether investors should be concerned about it.\n\nWhy gross margin is front and center for Nvidia and AI stocks\n\nAs the AI revolution took off, cloud computing companies and large enterprises clamored for as many of Nvidia's data center GPUs as they could get. The supply-demand mismatch enabled Nvidia to charge a premium for its chips, even as volumes grew. Hence, its gross margin expanded from a range between 55% and 65% \"pre-AI\" to a whopping 78.4% in the company's Q1 this year ending in April, while operating margin expanded from a range between 20% and 40% all the way up to 64.9% in the first quarter. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut as you can also see, gross and operating margin took a dip in the recently reported second quarter compared with Q1. Gross margin retreated to 75.1%, a decline of 3.3 percentage points, and operating margin declined to 62.1%. Meanwhile, on the conference call with analysts, CFO Colette Kress forecast gross margin of just 74.4% in the current quarter.\n\nThat could suggest a cooling of demand or pushback on price from large customers, who may be getting tired of paying through the nose for Nvidia chips. After all, investor concerns over cloud customers' getting a return on all of their AI spending is what led to the pullback in technology stocks this summer.\n\nBut Nvidia gave different reasons for the decline\n\nIn the release, Nvidia noted that the decline in gross margin was due to \"a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\"\n\nThat explanation should let Nvidia shareholders breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. It has been known that Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip would be pushed back slightly, because of a manufacturing defect discovered late in the manufacturing and sampling process.\n\nOn the call, Nvidia noted that it made a change to the GPU mask at its foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), in order to improve manufacturing yields. Of note, this appears to be a minor tweak, as CEO Jensen Huang noted no functional changes were necessary to the chip. Still, it appears there were enough defects on the initial sampling ramp-up of Blackwell that Nvidia had to scrap a fair amount of chips from early production at TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's not clear how much of the decline in gross margin was due to inventory writedowns. But the remaining margin decline was attributed to a \"mix shift to new products.\" This is where things get murky. Nvidia's gross margin could continue to fall back to earth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCan new products garner the same margin?\n\nIn chip manufacturing, newer products often take time to ramp up their yields, as the manufacturing process is perfected over time. But is the decline in Nvidia's gross margin due to lower initial yields in manufacturing, or is Nvidia increasingly limited in the premium it can charge for new products?\n\nMake no mistake: The current workhorse, the H200, is no doubt more expensive than the H100. However, newer products are also more complicated, and therefore expensive, for TSMC to produce.\n\nSo it's unclear if the remainder of the gross margin decline is due to lower initial yields, which eventually go higher as production ramps up, or if Nvidia, while charging more money for new products, can't maintain the same margin as the sticker price for newer chips go higher and higher.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia noted that 45% of its revenue comes from cloud service providers, all of whom are now pursuing their own in-house designed AI accelerators to lower costs. In addition, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), which isn't a cloud service provider but also probably accounts for a big chunk of Nvidia's revenue in addition to that 45%, has begun designing its own accelerators as well. And rival Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) forecasts above $4.5 billion in sales for its MI300 line of AI GPUs, which just came out this year and should keep Nvidia on its toes.\n\nAll of these companies, however, should continue to buy Nvidia chips. Nvidia still makes the most advanced neutral third-party GPU chip, and with developers already very familiar with its CUDA software, Nvidia should still see strong sales over the next few years.\n\nBut with all of its major customers now pursuing their own lower-cost self-designed alternatives and more competition incoming, Nvidia will have to compete that much harder. That can either come by staying a step ahead on the hardware side, or cutting prices -- or both.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia's investors need to keep an eye on gross margin, or perhaps model in some give-back in margin in the years ahead, even as revenue marches higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\n\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\n\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\n\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\n\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data—not too hot, not too cold—that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\n\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on  “historical trends” and the “market landscape” from various sectors which have “substantial” potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) recently exceeded analyst expectations in its latest quarterly earnings, signaling that its significant investment in AI is beginning to pay off and could lead to even more positive outcomes in the future. In response, Citi expressed an \"incrementally positive\" outlook on Meta's shares, citing improved user engagement, monetization, and expanding profit margins. As a result, Citi raised its price target for META from $550 to $580.\n\nJPMorgan also highlighted the benefits of AI for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) at three key levels: enhancements to its core Family of Apps (FoA), new opportunities and user experiences, and the scaling of the Metaverse. Consequently, JPMorgan raised its price target for META from $480 to $610. Additionally, Morgan Stanley praised Meta's advancements in its recommendation systems and overall quality through AI improvements.\n\nWhile the market has been cautious about Meta's substantial AI spending, the company aims to leverage AI to enhance user interactions, improve engagement, and better monetize its vast user base of 3.2 billion daily active users. With a robust free cash flow margin of around 30%, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is on track to generate $50 billion in free cash flow this year, which would place the stock at approximately 26 times this year's free cash flow. If this growth continues, Meta could achieve $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, reducing the stock's valuation to 21 times next year's free cash flow.\n\nWith a strong financial position, including $35 billion in net cash, a massive user base, and a leading role in the AI-driven consumer market, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is positioned as a solid long-term investment opportunity.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta Platforms’ META shares have gained 47.3% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s growth of 15.3% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 21%.\r\n\r\nMETA’s share price has risen due to its strategy of leveraging AI through its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. These services currently reach 3.2 billion people daily.\r\n\r\nThe social media giant has been taking a number of initiatives aimed at driving user base. A rich creator base has been a key catalyst for Meta Platforms. The company recently launched a Creator Lab in India (one of its biggest markets in terms of user base). Creator Lab is an educational resource designed by creators for creators.\r\n\r\nMETA is expanding Threads web features, including insights, multiple drafts and scheduling functions. These features will help creators easily plan content and connect with new and existing user bases.\r\n\r\nAI initiatives are gaining traction. META has expanded access to Meta AI, which is now available in seven new languages and 22 new countries.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMETA to Focus on Geothermal Energy for AI Data Centers\n\nAI data centers consume a lot of power. According to estimates from NVIDIA NVDA, hyper scalers, including META, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Google, plan to spend $1 trillion on data center upgrades related to AI. Hence, power consumption is expected to increase exponentially.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ AI initiatives require huge data-center-related spending. META currently expects a capital expenditure of $37-$40 billion for 2024, and is on track to spend more on developing its advanced models and largest AI services in the world.\r\n\r\nMETA is now focusing on expanding its use of geothermal energy as part of its commitment to using clean energy for work.\r\n\r\nIn partnership with Sage Geosystems, Meta Platforms recently announced plans to boost geothermal power production in the United States. This collaboration aims to develop a geothermal system to provide emission-free power for data centers and help control rising electricity demand. The first phase is expected to come online by 2027, generating 150 megawatts.\r\n\r\nThis agreement marks the first use of next-generation geothermal power in the United States, highlighting the potential of geothermal energy as a viable renewable resource across the country. As part of the deal, Sage Geosystems will supply carbon-free power to Meta Platforms’ data centers using its patented Geopressured Geothermal System (GGS). Currently, geothermal energy is mainly used in Nevada, Utah and California.\r\n\r\nThe GGS technology is preferred because it uses hot dry rock, which is much more abundant than the resources used in traditional hydrothermal formations. This abundance makes the GGS technology easy to scale and rapidly deploy in the United States and globally.\r\n\r\nAs one of the biggest corporate purchasers of renewable energy worldwide, Meta Platforms has contracted more than 12,000 MW in renewable energy projects. This increases the effort to move toward a carbon-free economy by offering solutions that improve the environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA Stock’s Prospects Rides on AI Usage\n\nMeta Platforms reported a 22% year-over-year increase in revenues to $39.1 billion due to increased user interaction on its platforms, driven by AI-recommended content. \r\n\r\nInstagram has become a significant revenue generator for Meta Platforms, driven by AI. Meta AI is used to recommend about 40% of the content that users see on Instagram. According to META, users have spent 24% more time on Instagram since the inception of Reels. AI is significantly enhancing Instagram's monetization efforts. \r\n\r\nMessenger and WhatsApp are the most valued drivers for Meta Platforms. It is impressive how quickly small and medium-sized enterprises are utilizing WhatsApp Business. The growing use of these platforms for communication increases Meta Platforms’ potential to enter and capitalize on the lucrative payments market.\r\n\r\nMETA's long-term success depends on executing progressive plans, including metaverse, AI integration and revenue diversification.

        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) share price has soared 176% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Meta Platforms achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 76% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of companies we expect will grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Crucial jobs report kicks off a new month: What to know this week",
        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,000 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings.

(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore’s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\n\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company is using AI to improve the advertisement side of the business. This strategy appears to be bearing fruit. The tech giant recently beat market expectations on earnings for both the top and bottom lines, and also raised guidance for AI-related capital expenditures. Meta managed to grow twice as fast as rival Google in the ads space in the second quarter, even while reporting an increase in price per ad figures during the earnings call.\n\nThis effective AI strategy has caught the attention of market experts on Wall Street. Investment advisory Tigress Financial has a Strong Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). In a recent investor note, the advisory highlighted that the cash flow of the tech giant was enabling ongoing investments in artificial intelligence initiatives that would drive user engagement, better content, and a more effective advertising experience.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc. (META): A Good Fast Money Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other fast money stocks.\n\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\n\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\n\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\n\"That’s right. We’re not against rotation; we’re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don’t go down on bad news, we won’t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\n\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\n\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn’t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we’ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it’s really about earnings.\"\n\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\n\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\n\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today’s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today’s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\n\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it’s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed’s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential.

This large user base creates substantial revenue opportunities through targeted advertising, a key driver of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s financial success. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investment in the metaverse is a bold move aimed at unlocking new revenue streams.\n\nThrough its Reality Labs division, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is at the forefront of developing augmented and virtual reality technologies, which have the potential to transform online interactions. Although still in the early stages, these initiatives promise significant long-term growth as the metaverse concept gains traction.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s strong financial performance this quarter highlights its leadership in the tech industry, driven by the innovative release of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI model. Llama 3.1, known for its better cost performance compared to leading closed models, could be a turning point for open-source AI, much like Linux was in its field. This innovation underscores Meta Platforms Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company’s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta’s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,00 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings.

(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Billionaire-Held Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "When looking at the top bets of some of the most prominent billionaire investors, there is a common theme that stands out. These professionals are favoring highly profitable companies that dominate their industry. Most importantly, they are investing in the stocks that trade at reasonable valuations relative to future growth expectations.\n\nStephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors have had successful investing careers, with their net worth ranging from $2.5 billion to $7 billion, according to Forbes. Let's look at these firms' largest holdings at the end of the second quarter and why investors should expect outstanding returns from these stocks over the next few years.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nLone Pine Capital manages over $16 billion in assets. Its largest holding at the end of the second quarter was leading chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also commonly known as TSMC.\n\nTSMC is a widely held tech stock among the most successful investment firms. The company enjoys a lucrative position as the world's top chip foundry. It manufactures chips for Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and a host of other semiconductor companies and commands over 60% share of the global foundry market.\n\nTSMC gives investors broad exposure to the trends driving growth in the semiconductor industry without the additional risks of picking the winners and losers among the Nvidias and Intels of the world.\n\nTSMC's advantages in advanced chipmaking positions it well for growth as companies invest in powerful chips to handle the demanding workloads of artificial intelligence (AI) training. The demand for high-performance chips drove a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter, and it should continue that momentum into 2025.\n\nManagement expects strong results in the near term driven by improving chip demand for smartphones and AI. Strong top-line growth should pad profits, as TSMC generates a high operating margin of 45% relative to revenue. This will fund the company's plan to spend at least $30 billion this year in capital expenditures to support long-term demand for advanced chip technologies.\n\nWall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 26% over the next several years. With the stock likely to continue trading at its current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26, investors could earn a return on par with those estimates.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) estimates there are 3.2 billion people that use its family of apps every day. This is a strong advantage in the digital advertising market, which is how the company makes money.\n\nStory continues\n\nChase Coleman's Tiger Global Management has held a large stake in the social media leader since 2018, and it held $3.7 billion worth of shares in the second quarter, making it the firm's largest holding.\n\nMeta AI is already having a big impact on the user experience in Facebook and Instagram. The company's AI models improved the quality of recommendations, which can have a big impact on the time spent on these platforms. As a result, ad impressions and price per ad were up 10% year over year last quarter, and that drove a strong revenue increase of 22% over the year-ago quarter.\n\nStrong revenue growth will provide more profit for Meta to reinvest in advanced AI models and, therefore, keep the positive cycle of growth going. \"We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta is a highly profitable business. It generated a profit of $51 billion on $149 billion of revenue over the last four quarters. Management plans to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures this year, with a significant increase expected in 2025. This spending will support AI research and other products for long-term growth.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Meta to post annualized earnings growth of 17% in the coming years. Assuming the stock continues to trade at the same P/E, that's enough growth for the shares to double in value within the next five years.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a powerful brand in e-commerce and the enterprise space with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business. It generates most of its $604 billion in trailing 12-month revenue from retail-related services, including advertising, but around two-thirds of its operating profit comes from cloud services.\n\nViking Global Investors held $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock in Q2, making it the firm's largest holding, and it added significantly to its stake in the quarter.\n\n\"We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\" CEO Andy Jassy said in the second-quarter earnings report. Amazon is benefiting from companies migrating their on-premise data systems to the cloud, and a big incentive for this migration in 2024 is taking advantage of AI services.\n\nAWS revenue increased 19% year over year last quarter, and Amazon should see this momentum continue. Amazon offers tools to help customers build their own AI applications with Amazon Bedrock, in addition to its proprietary AI chips like Trainium, to provide more cost-efficient computing power for AI training.\n\nAmazon's increasing AI capabilities position it well in a cloud market expected to reach $774 billion, according to Statista. Wall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to increase at a 23% annualized rate. Investors should expect the stock to command a premium P/E multiple and hit new highs for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market is a wonderful way to build long-term wealth. But while you might think you need huge sums of capital, that's simply not true. Even relatively modest amounts of money can still get you started.\n\nWith $1,000 ready to put to work, investors should look no further than Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). About three shares of the former can be purchased, while investors can snag one share of the social media powerhouse. Let's take a closer look at these two \"Magnificent Seven\" businesses.\n\nDominating the tech sector\n\nAlphabet and Meta are two of the most valuable companies on earth. And this position has come from them both dominating the tech sector.\n\nAlphabet has an impressive lineup of internet products and services, ranging from Search and Gmail to Android and YouTube, for example. Meta, on the other hand, operates a family of social media apps that combined have almost 3.3 billion daily active users.\n\nThis unmatched reach and user attention has turned both companies into digital advertising juggernauts. Combined, they command 47% of the U.S. market. Given that the industry is projected to see annualized growth of almost 16% on a worldwide basis through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research, these businesses have a powerful secular trend working in their favor.\n\nIn the past five years, Alphabet and Meta have increased their revenue at average yearly rates of 16.8% and 18.3%, respectively. It's not a stretch to think that double-digit top-line gains could continue for several years.\n\nSuperb financials\n\nThere are many companies that are in trouble financially. This could mean they have unsustainable debt loads, or that they simply aren't profitable. Fortunately, Alphabet and Meta don't have any of these issues. In fact, they are some of the most financially sound enterprises on the face of the planet. Both have incredibly strong balance sheets with huge net cash positions.\n\nTo be fair, many younger tech-focused businesses aren't profitable because they are investing so heavily into growth. And the goal is to generate positive earnings at some point in the future. That reasoning makes sense, but a favorable outcome is always far from certain.\n\nThings are different in this instance, though. Because Alphabet and Meta are already scaled platforms, with huge revenue and established business models that benefit from network effects, they are seeing the benefits on the bottom line. They generate sizable earnings on a consistent basis, with operating margins that exceeded 30% last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis allows them to invest heavily in AI initiatives, mainly around building out data centers and other network infrastructure to handle the higher workload. While the ultimate payoff of these efforts remains a question mark, Alphabet and Meta can easily afford the capital expenditures, while also paying dividends and buying back lots of outstanding shares.\n\nDon't forget valuation\n\nAnother variable that can't be skipped when looking at an investment is the valuation. Investors have even more reason to be bullish with this in mind. No matter how wonderful a business looks, if you overpay, forward returns can be disappointing.\n\nOn a forward price-to-earnings basis, these two stocks still look like compelling buys, even after their impressive gains in the past 20 months. Alphabet's multiple of 22 and Meta's multiple of 25 might not be as attractive as they were at the start of 2023, but they are still very reasonable.\n\nThe market is presenting investors with a solid opportunity to buy a couple of the best companies out there. Investing $1,000 in their stocks is a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $731,449!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Ark Investment Management operates several private funds as well as multiple public exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in innovative technology stocks. Last year, Ark CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting the companies will generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nSince Wood made that prediction, the Ark Venture Fund has piled into several private AI software companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Ark's ETFs own several AI-related software stocks including Palantir Technologies, UiPath, and Tesla.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be an exciting list of winners over the long term. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. Amazon: A tech giant with multiple AI layers\n\nAmazon might be one of the most diverse AI companies in the world. It's using the technology in its flagship e-commerce business, its advertising business, and, most importantly, its cloud computing segment led by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAI powers the recommendation algorithm on Amazon.com, which learns what each customer likes so it can show them similar products to boost sales. Customers can also use a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus, which is trained on Amazon's product catalog so it can answer questions and offer recommendations. Plus, Amazon just launched a new tool for its fulfillment centers called Project Private Investigator, which uses AI to identify faulty products before they are sent to customers.\n\nBut AWS is home to an even more exciting set of AI initiatives. Not only is Amazon designing its own data center chips to offer developers a more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's hardware, but the tech giant also developed its own family of large language models (LLMs) called Titan. These LLMs are multimodal, which means developers can customize them to create their own generative AI software applications that are capable of generating text, images, and more.\n\nTitan is accessible on the Bedrock platform in AWS, along with LLMs from several leading third-party AI start-ups like Anthropic.\n\nFinally, AWS launched a virtual assistant called Amazon Q last year, which is capable of debugging and generating computer code to accelerate the pace of software development. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says Q is the most capable AI tool of its kind because it has the highest known acceptance rate for code suggestions, and it catches more security vulnerabilities than any competing product.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS alone generated a record $26.2 billion in revenue during the recent second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which was a 19% increase from the year-ago period. It marked the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, thanks in large part to demand for AI. Amazon is one of the most attractively valued members of the trillion-dollar club, and if Cathie Wood is right, its stock could deliver spectacular returns for investors in the coming years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant with an AI twist\n\nMeta is the parent company of popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Together, they serve more than 3.2 billion people every single day, and AI is playing an increasingly important role in the user experience.\n\nFacebook and Instagram, for example, have evolved from social networks into entertainment platforms, with AI-powered algorithms showing each user the most relevant posts, even if they weren't shared by someone they know. This is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's family of apps, which means they view more ads and drive more revenue for the tech giant.\n\nMeta continues to deliver new innovations for its advertisers, too. They can use AI to create engaging text and image content for their ads, which is great for businesses that don't have an in-house marketing team. But the process will become even easier over time. Eventually, businesses will be able to tell Meta their advertising budget and their objective, and its AI engine will autonomously handle everything from crafting the ad to selecting the target audience.\n\nMeta also developed its own open-source LLM called Llama. It just launched Llama 3.1, the most advanced version so far, with 405 billion parameters. The company says it's already competitive with most other leading models, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg is already focusing on Llama 4, which he says will set the bar for the industry next year. Llama is at the foundation of many AI features in Meta's pipeline, so it's key to the company's strategy.\n\nMeta AI is one of those features. It's a user-facing AI assistant, which is now accessible in the chat and search functions across all of the company's apps. It can accurately answer questions on a broad range of topics, and it can be prompted to generate text and image content. It also lays the groundwork for Business AI, which could be a big revenue driver for Meta in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent capable of handling customer queries and even processing sales.\n\nMeta stock is trading near an all-time high right now, but it's still attractively valued relative to its big-tech peers. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26.7 as of this writing, which is about 17% cheaper than the 32 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. Given the P/E discount, this could be a great entry point for long-term investors, especially if Cathie Wood proves to be right.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top Research Reports for Apple, Tesla &amp; T-Mobile US",
        "content": "Monday, September 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), as well as a micro-cap stock Tucows Inc. (TCX).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +18.8% over the year-to-date against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s gain of +19.5%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.\r\n\r\nApple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+4.9% vs. +1.8%). Amid competition intensifying in the EV space the company focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.\r\n\r\nThe expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\nOf late, Tesla has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of T-Mobile US have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+30.0% vs. +29.9%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. In the second quarter, the company added 1.3 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 301,000, both metrics being the best in the industry.\r\n\r\nTMUS’ 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against the companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum.\r\n\r\nHowever, owing to the stock’s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. The high debt burden is a concern. Stiff competition is straining profitability. We are reiterating our Neutral recommendation.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile US here >>>)\r\n\r\nTucows’ shares have gained +8.3% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Content industry’s gain of +14.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $230.64 million continues to see strong subscriber growth, with a 25% year-over-year increase to 48,200 in second-quarter 2024. Revenues rose 17% to $14.6 million, supported by expanding infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTing’s gross margin grew 39% year over year, reflecting cost management and efficiency gains. The company completed a $63-million asset-backed securitization, helping fund its fiber expansion while reducing capital risk.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising debt and liquidity concerns due to declining cash raise risks. Depreciation costs and challenges in customer acquisition add pressure as Ting competes with larger ISPs. Additionally, Tucows Domains saw a 3% decline in transactions, and continued pressure in this stable business could affect the overall performance. Slower fiber network expansion and increasing competition can hinder growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tucows here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Novartis AG (NVS), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Jim Cramer Hand Picks These 3 Stocks To Ride The Crest Of The Chinese Stimulus Frenzy\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nChina has gone all out to stimulate the domestic economy and a slew of measures the government and the central bank proposed has kickstarted a strong rally in the domestic stock market. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on the development and recommended a few stocks that could be potential beneficiaries.\n\nWhat Happened: “The Chinese are, once again, stimulating and everyone’s back,” said Cramer in a post on X, formerly Twitter. He also recommended Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) for those looking for stimulus plays.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

The index has gained nearly 22% since Sept. 20 and is up about a little over 12% for the year.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China announced last week it will in the near future cut the reserve requirement ratio, which is the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, by 50 basis points freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) for new lending, Reuters reported.\n\nThe central bank hinted at the possibility of reducing it by an incremental 0.25-0.50% points. The PBoC also said it would lower the seven-day repo rate by 0.2 points, the interest rate on a medium-term lending facility by about 30 basis points and loan prime rates by 20-25 basis points.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

Cupertino counts China as its major manufacturing base despite its efforts to diversify its production base. China is also a key market for the company’s consumer electronics products, specifically its iPhone, and its services business. Of late, Apple has been stymied by domestic competition that is flooding the market with cheaper smartphones. Huawei has re-emerged as a key rival for Apple in the Chinese smartphone market.\n\nCoffee chain retailer Starbucks has a strong presence in China. The weakening of economic fundamentals in China has impacted the company’s sales in recent quarters. In the June quarter, Starbucks’ same-store sales in China fell 14% compared to a more modest 2% drop in the U.S.\n\nAlibaba’s fortunes are closely tied to the Chinese economy as it generates the bulk of its e-commerce sales from China.\n\nApart from Cramer’s recommendation, a Chinese economic revival may also bode well for commodity and energy stocks and those multinational corporations have a big presence in the country such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe iShares MSCI China ETF (NYSE:MCHI) rallied 3.35% to $52.70 in premarket trading on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "content": "Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Demand Correction In Sight: Analyst Highlights Delivery Trends Across Global Markets\n\nJP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $265.\n\nIn the third week of Chatterjee’s Apple Product Availability Tracker, delivery lead times are showing trends, which, if continued, will explain the weaker lead times for the Pro models in the initial weeks as only an aberration led by a combination of better supply mix and delay in picking up momentum from higher-end consumers awaiting the release of Apple Intelligence, he noted.\n\nThe analyst said lead times, in the aggregate, have moderated as expected following the peak in the second week.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPhone To Fuel 96% Of 2025 Revenue, Analyst Says: A Safer Bet Than AI-Heavy Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta?\n\nStill, Pro-model lead times remained steady for week three, contrary to the typical moderation in prior years.\n\nBase models led the moderation in the last week for iPhone 16 series in aggregate, while lead times for Pro models were stable; iPhone 16 (Base model) moderated by seven days (versus moderation of 1 day from the second week to third week last year for iPhone 15), with moderation of 11 days for the Plus model (versus moderation of 1 day from second week to third week last year for 15 Plus), but lead times for Pro and Pro Max held steady over the last week relative to moderation of 7 days and nine days, respectively, from second week to third week for 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nIn aggregate, although overall lead times for the iPhone 16 models are still lower relative to iPhone 15 last year, the narrowing of the gap between the two groups (Base versus Pro) over the previous week and steady lead times for the Pro models highlight the likelihood that the initial slower momentum in demand for the Pro models is correcting itself with the release of Apple Intelligence drawing closer.\n\nAs per Chatterjee’s U.S. Tracker, delivery lead times stabilized for Pro models while Base model lead times were moderate. The U.S. accounts for ~32% of iPhone shipments.\n\nAs per the analyst’s China Tracker, delivery lead times dropped drastically for 16 Plus and moderately for 16 while remaining stable for Pro models. China accounts for ~20% of iPhone shipments.\n\nAs per his Europe Tracker, lead times for Base models were moderate, while Pro lead times were stable, similar to other geographies.

        "title": "How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation",
        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmong the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOf all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nEven though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.\n\nMicrosoft's diverse revenue streams and strong competitive moats\n\nMicrosoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.\n\nNote that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.\n\nWindows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nWith these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.\n\nMicrosoft's pathways to future growth\n\nIn the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: Microsoft's presentation\n\nFor the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.\n\nConstructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.\n\nMore personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.\n\nThe cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.\n\nSome more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.\n\nWhat bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.\n\nMicrosoft's high valuation is justifiable\n\nConsidering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nAs the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.\n\nThis valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.\n\nTraditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).\n\nIn short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- According to Morgan Stanley analysts, lead times for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are stabilizing and even extending, marking an unexpectedly positive development.\n\nThe bank said that as of September 27, iPhone 16 lead times remain shorter than those seen in the last three iPhone cycles, but the recent stabilization of the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max models is noteworthy.\n\n\"At T+14, iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max lead times have both extended by 2 days vs. T+11, vs. iPhone 14&15 Pro/Pro Max lead times contracting 4-5 days at this point,\" Morgan Stanley analysts stated.\n\nThis elongation suggests that the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max demand trajectory is more closely aligned with the successful iPhone 12 and 13 cycles rather than the weaker iPhone 14 and 15 models.\n\n\"We are seeing this same trend internationally too, with lead times for the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max extending by ~2 days, on average, vs. last Tuesday in all regions but Chin,\" the bank said.\n\nMorgan Stanley added that this extension resembles the trajectory seen with the iPhone 12 and 13 models, which also experienced elongating lead times due to supply chain disruptions. However, no such disruptions have been reported for the iPhone 16 models.\n\nAlthough Apple recently adjusted its wafer orders at TSMC, Morgan Stanley does not believe this reflects softening demand for the iPhone 16.\n\n\"Apple likely has excessive processor inventories,\" the analysts pointed out, emphasizing that the wafer adjustment is not a direct indication of current demand trends.\n\nWhile Morgan Stanley's view on the iPhone 16 cycle remains unchanged, they are closely watching this emerging trend of stabilizing lead times as a potentially positive indicator.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple: iPhone 16 lead times stabilizing - Morgan Stanley\n\nInsurance brokerage Marsh McLennan strikes $7.75 billion deal for McGriff Insurance Services\n\nStellantis cuts 2024 profit outlook as US sales crisis deepens\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nChris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is “ a lot of momentum” behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.\n\n“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”\n\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.\n\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\n“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.\n\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock to Watch for the Rest of 2024?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nMore and more Wall Street analysts are starting to realize that the much-hyped demand for iPhone 16 might never be realized and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a different world now.\n\nLead times for the iPhone 16 are shorter than in recent years, according to investment firms. Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring points out that while supply has improved and there are some signs of strong demand, it’s wise to remain cautious. As of September 24, average lead times in the U.S. for the iPhone 16 stand at 15.2 days, down from 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14 in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobally, the trend is similar, with average lead times for the iPhone 16 at 16.3 days, compared to 28.5 days for the iPhone 15. UBS analysts echo these findings, noting that typically, wait times for high-end models like the Pro and Pro Max increase as demand stabilizes. However, this year, wait times for the iPhone 16 haven’t shown the same uptick as in previous launches.\n\nUBS suspects demand might stay below expectations until the rollout of iOS 18.2 in November, which will introduce more AI features. The update, iOS 18.1, is set for mid-October and will showcase some of these features. While it’s early to draw firm conclusions from lead times, Woodring suggests the outlook for iPhone builds leans more negative than positive, despite reports of strong initial demand from some regions like India.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38\n\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company’s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.\n\n“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\n“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.\n\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL): Navigating AI Integration Amid Mixed iPhone 16 Reception\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBrad Gerstner’s Stake: $57,155,950\n\nTalking to CNBC in June, Brad Gerstner said:\n\n“Clearly, Apple with a billion users is going to play a significant role in introducing AI to the masses. And part of the reason we like Apple is only 5% of Apple users today can access Apple Intelligence so they are going to have to upgrade these devices in order to play.”\n\nHowever, initial numbers on Apple’s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. “On average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they’re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models.

Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but\n\nin 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nHungry upstarts don’t always get the attention of major players, but in the case of You.com, founder Richard Socher got a front-row seat with Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\n\n“I was extremely impressed with Jensen,” Socher told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (above video; listen in here).\n\nHis AI-powered search engine recently announced a $50 million Series B round with investors including Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM) Ventures, and DuckDuckGo. The capital raise valued the Google (GOOG) and Yahoo rival at close to $1 billion.\n\nSocher said he met with Huang for nearly two hours around the time of the investment, discussing topics ranging from history to running a business.\n\n“I don’t generally get nervous with most people, but it was very impressive to hear him giving advice,\" Socher said.\n\nDuring his conversation, Socher says Huang shared that “he focused a lot on the speed of Nvidia\" during its early years.\n\nEventually, Nvidia opted to pivot a little to gain focus.\n\n“At some point, they realized that the best way is to focus on gaming first and really dominate that niche,” Socher said, adding that Huang suggested staying focused on You.com's mission of being an AI-powered alternative to Google.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Socher and Nvidia have crossed paths.\n\nIn the early 2010s, his research group at Stanford utilized Nvidia GPUs. At that time, Nvidia mostly sold GPU products to the graphics sector. “Nvidia was like, ‘who are you? Why are you trying to buy our GPUs,’” said Socher, noting that GPUs now assist with the company's AI workloads.\n\nNvidia launched in 1993 — born from Huang's scribbling on a napkin at a Denny's — to develop 3D graphics for gaming and multimedia purposes. Back then, an increasing number of consumers were taking the computing plunge, leading to demand for higher-powered computers.\n\nSix years later, Nvidia introduced graphics processing units (GPU), and in 2012, it brought AI to the forefront by introducing the AlexNet neural network.\n\nThis summer, Nvidia introduced an initiative that would bring generative AI to a wider audience using its latest GPU technology. The company's AI chips are seen as having a wide performance lead over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), leading to impressive financial results over the past two years.\n\nNvidia's second quarter sales and earnings rose 122% and 152%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAfter a summer pullback following mixed third quarter guidance, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world. It sports a market cap of $2.98 trillion, while Microsoft sits at $3.18 trillion and Apple stands at $3.46 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance's comparison tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date, shares are up 145% compared to an 18% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Sending a $300 Billion Warning to Stock Investors",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has a 70-year track record of producing market-trouncing returns for anyone willing to invest alongside him.\n\nHis Buffett Partnership Ltd. produced an annualized return of 31.6% from 1957 through 1968, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average compounded at a rate of 9.1%. He ultimately folded BPL into Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which he took over in 1965, continuing to produce returns that left the rest of the market in the dust. Through 2023, Buffett's increased the value of Berkshire shares at an average rate of 19.8%, versus 10.2% for the S&P 500 in that period.\n\nSo, when Buffett makes an investment decision, the whole world pays attention. Buffett's made several big decisions during the past few quarters regarding Berkshire's investment portfolio. They all add up into a significant warning for stock investors, indicating there's not a lot to like in the stock market right now.\n\nBuffett's amassed a cash and Treasury bill position that approached $300 billion in the third quarter. There are several factors pushing Buffett's cash position to new records. Here's how we got here, and what it means for investors. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett can't stop selling stocks\n\nBuffett has sold more in stocks than he bought in each of the past seven quarters. The Oracle of Omaha made his biggest stock sale in history last quarter, when he cut Berkshire's position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) by about half of its remaining stake, or about $73 billion. Total equity sales through the first half of 2024 were $97 billion, while he made just $4.3 billion in new purchases.\n\nThe stock sales keep coming. Although we don't have final Q3 numbers yet, Securities and Exchange Commission filings indicate Buffett sold a large portion of Berkshire's investment in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Through Sept. 24, he sold $9 billion worth of shares.\n\nBuffett has said that the decision to sell portions of Berkshire's investments in stocks like Apple or Bank of America is based on the idea that corporate tax rates will rise when the current tax law expires at the end of next year. Berkshire is sitting on enormous unrealized capital gains for both stocks, which have climbed considerably from Berkshire's original purchase prices from 2016 through 2018.\n\nBut Buffett's selling decision also implies that he thinks those stocks trade near or above their intrinsic value. If he thought they were undervalued, he'd be willing to pay higher taxes later to own an undervalued asset today.\n\nThat sentiment can broadly explain why Buffett has been less active on the purchasing side of the portfolio as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett's not even buying his favorite stocks\n\nBuffett's favorite stock to purchase during the past few years, by far, has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. He's consistently bought back shares of the stock since the board of directors updated the repurchase authorization in 2018. Buffett now has the opportunity to buy back shares whenever he feels the stock is priced below its intrinsic value.\n\nBut last quarter's repurchases slowed to a snail's pace, totaling just $345 million. In June, Buffett elected not to buy any shares at all. And based on Berkshire's reporting in July, it doesn't look like he made any stock repurchases to start Q3. Considering Berkshire stock has since, for the most part, traded well above the levels it traded for in June and July, it's unlikely Buffett made significant repurchases in Q3.\n\nAnother favorite stock of Buffett's for the past few years is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Buffett has been invested in the oil and gas company since 2019, when he acquired $10 billion in preferred shares of the company. He's gone on to buy 29% of the company's common stock, which means he has to file a disclosure with the SEC whenever he buys or sells shares of the company. But no such disclosures have materialized since June. That's despite the stock falling to new lows amid declining oil prices.\n\nThe cash is piling up fast\n\nWith $9 billion in gross stock sales from Bank of America alone during the quarter and limited capital deployed toward new stock purchases or buybacks, Berkshire's cash position is climbing quickly. As of the end of the second quarter, Buffett was already sitting on $277 billion in cash and Treasuries.\n\nWhen you add in the operating cash flow from Berkshire's core operations of about $10 billion plus the interest earned on Berkshire's existing Treasury holdings, the cash position at Berkshire could easily top $300 billion. The one factor that might stop it from reaching that milestone is the estimated tax bill it had to pay this quarter on the huge stock sales Buffett executed earlier this year.\n\nAt this point, cash and Treasuries are approaching 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's investable assets. That's before you include the $169 billion in insurance float available to invest as well.\n\nBuffett is showing a clear preference for safe assets and doesn't even like the valuation of his own company right now. The warning is clear for stock investors: There's not much to like in the stock market -- at least, not for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.\n\nShould you follow Buffett's lead?\n\nRemember, most individuals aren't managing a $600 billion investment portfolio. It's harder to maneuver a large ship than it is to steer a tiny speedboat. Buffett also has the challenge of producing above-market returns for shareholders. What's the value in buying Berkshire Hathaway stock if investors could effectively get the same returns from an S&P 500 index fund?\n\nThat is to say a lot of large-cap stocks that make up the investable universe for Berkshire Hathaway are unattractive at today's prices. That might even include Berkshire Hathaway stock itself. Buffett's lack of recent share repurchases suggests as much, at least.\n\nBut the investment universe is much larger for individual investors. Smaller stocks look particularly attractive from a valuation standpoint and could benefit from forthcoming interest rate cuts and growing money supply during the next few years.\n\nWhile investors shouldn't ignore Buffett's warning, it's important to understand the implications. Just because Buffett doesn't have a lot of great investment options right now doesn't mean smaller investors can't put their money to work in the stock market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tata iPhone component plant halts production indefinitely after fire",
        "content": "By Praveen Paramasivam and Munsif Vengattil\n\nCHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Production will remain suspended indefinitely at a Tata Electronics plant in southern India that makes Apple iPhone components after a fire at the weekend, officials said on Monday as they acted to prevent further damage from the blaze.\n\n\"We have stationed fire engines at the plant as there are chances of a follow-up fire incident or smoke coming off when the sheds that had fallen during the accident are removed,\" M. Velu, a district fire officer, told Reuters by telephone.\n\n\"We have not yet ascertained the cause of the fire.\"\n\nThe fire broke out at the plant in Tamil Nadu state early on Saturday, leaving 10 people with minor injuries and halting production. It is the latest incident to affect Apple's iPhone supply chain in India just as the tech giant is looking to diversify beyond China and sees India as a key growth market.\n\nApple has not commented on the incident, while Tata has said the cause of the fire is under investigation and emergency protocols at its plant ensured its employees were safe.\n\nRescue teams were still clearing debris on Monday and officials have struggled with inspections due to the extensive damage.\n\nThe plant makes critical back panels and some other components for iPhones. In the same complex, another building is due to start up iPhone assembly before the end of the year, but it's not clear how it has been impacted.\n\nDistrict Collector K. M. Sarayu posted photos on X after visiting the Tata plant on Sunday which showed the building and some machines, as well as ceilings burnt and covered in soot.\n\nA senior Indian health official, Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, who visited the plant on Sunday told Reuters it was \"very badly burnt and (there was) absolutely no visibility inside\".\n\n\"The structure was falling, the roof was falling. No one could even go inside,\" she said.\n\nTata Electronics, part of the $165 billion Indian salt-to-software Tata Group, is one of the major suppliers for Apple in India, along with Taiwan's Foxconn.\n\n(Writing by Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Haripriya Suresh; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\n\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company launched the latest model of the iPhone, dubbed iPhone 16, earlier this month. The new phone debuted with a lot of hype around Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) believes will change the way consumers interact with phones altogether. Initial demand figures for the phone paint a confusing picture, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has dismissed concerns around slower growth projections, reiterating in a recent investor note that with the introduction of artificial intelligence, a number of camera upgrades and better battery life as part of the iPhone 16, it was possible the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle topped 90 million units on initial launch. Ives further claimed that the launch of the iPhone 16 was the start of an AI driven supercycle, and throughout fiscal 2025, Apple could sell more than 240 million units of the phone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Helping build Berkshire Hathaway into a near-trillion-dollar enterprise and co-founding the Giving Pledge charity are just a couple of things Warren Buffett is known for.\n\nDespite his prolific career, one thing that Buffett is not really known to be is a technology investor. In fact, many of his most famous and lucrative investments came from simple businesses across financial services and consumer goods.\n\nHowever, Buffett has been a staunch supporter of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for almost a decade. Today, Apple represents Berkshire's largest position -- comprising roughly 30% of its portfolio.\n\nAlthough Apple stock has posted significant gains since Berkshire's initial purchase in 2016, some on Wall Street are calling for even further share price appreciation. In particular, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities has a $300 price target on Apple stock -- implying 32% upside as of the market close on Sept. 24.\n\nLet's explore some catalysts that could fuel Apple stock and assess if there is a good opportunity to buy the stock now.\n\nPositive macro indicators\n\nFor the last couple of years, high inflation and rising interest rates have daunted the macroeconomy in the U.S. Moreover, as a global enterprise, Apple has also not been immune to some of the factors slowing down other major geographic regions such as China.\n\nIn turn, consumers and businesses have tightened budgets and spending habits have changed. People have been more cost-conscious over the last couple of years, opting to forgo expensive new iPhones or MacBooks. US Inflation Rate Chart\n\nHowever, as inflation levels show signs of decelerating and interest rate tapering from the Federal Reserve begins, consumer purchasing power should start to strengthen.\n\nDid someone say artificial intelligence?\n\nFor the last few years, several megacap technology companies have made big splashes in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena. Apple has not been one of these companies.\n\nHowever, during a recent segment on CNBC, Dan Ives proclaimed that Apple is about to enter a \"renaissance.\" I agree.\n\nFor starters, Apple's new iPhone 16 hit the shelves last week. As I alluded to above, a lot of users in the Apple ecosystem have not been upgrading their devices over the last couple of years. But with signs of economic improvement on the horizon, I think Apple is set to recognize some deferred demand in its new hardware.\n\nFurthermore, I think Apple's recent collaboration with OpenAI will bring two additional catalysts to the company.\n\nFirst, integrating OpenAI's capabilities into its products has helped spur the creation of Apple Intelligence. As the company begins to roll out new AI-powered services, I think consumers will be inspired to upgrade and purchase Apple's new line of products.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Ives is predicting that the relationship with OpenAI will be just the first in a series of AI-inspired partnerships for Apple. In particular, Ives is calling for a deal between Apple and Baidu. Baidu can be thought of as the Google-equivalent in China. Such a deal could help reignite demand for Apple products overseas, particularly in China.\n\nWhether or not a specific deal with Baidu comes to fruition is less important to me. At a higher level, I am aligned with Ives' thinking that OpenAI will be just one in a series of partnerships that Apple strikes as it finally begins penetrating the AI market.\n\nAll of these factors could create a tailwind for Apple, which Ives calls a \"supercycle.\" In my eyes, Apple's entrance into the AI realm could represent a pivotal growth arc for the company. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock right now?\n\nOne drawback with Apple stock is that it is pricey at the moment. Right now, Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7 sits at a significant premium to the S&P 500's forward P/E of 22.9.\n\nFurthermore, forward P/E trends for the S&P 500 have been normalizing for some time. By contrast, Apple has been experiencing notable valuation expansion. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nI bring all of this up because investors should understand that Apple stock has become more expensive, despite its delayed entrance into the technology industry's newest frontier: AI. There is a fair argument to be made that some of the AI-driven growth is already baked into Apple's share price.\n\nDespite this narrative, I think the company's growth from the new iPhone and from Apple Intelligence more broadly is too tough to call one way or the other right now. For these reasons, I would not underestimate Apple's ability to command reignited growth thanks to a resilient and restored consumer.\n\nIn the long run, I still see Apple as a compelling opportunity and think shares are worth a close look right now.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 773% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 168% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 23, 2024\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Apple.

Here's how\n\n“We shouldn't forget that it is at an all time [high], almost everything, price [to] earnings, price [to] book, price [to] sales, what have you, and nor should we forget that the greatest equity investor is about ready to show a balance sheet that's 50-50, with more T-bills than stocks,” he said in an interview with Fox Business.\n\nGrant was alluding to investing legend Warren Buffett, implying that Buffett’s pivot toward safer assets like Treasury bills — short-term debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with maturities of one year or less — may be a red flag for investors.\n\n“When the greatest equity investor owns more bills than equities, one at least is advised to step back and say, if this is perfection, how does it improve?” Grant warned, suggesting that investors consider the potential risks of an overheated market.\n\nBuffett’s cash reserve\n\nBuffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stakes in several major holdings this year.\n\nFor instance, in Q2, Berkshire sold 389 million shares of its top holding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), cutting its position by 49.3%. It also reduced its stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF) by 21.3%, offloading 2.65 million shares. Additionally, a more recent filing reveals that Berkshire trimmed its stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) down to 10.5% in Q3.\n\nWhile Berkshire did make some purchases in Q2, it sold far more than it bought, marking the seventh consecutive quarter as a net seller of stocks.\n\nAs a result, the company is sitting on a substantial cash reserve. As of June 30, 2024, Berkshire’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills totaled $271.5 billion.\n\nWhat’s particularly noteworthy is the vast amount Berkshire has allocated to Treasury bills. By the end of June, Berkshire held a whopping $234.618 billion in Treasury bills.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s more than the U.S. Federal Reserve's Treasury bill holdings, which stood at $195.293 billion as of September 25.\n\nStill, Buffett held a larger position in stocks. As of the end of June, Berkshire’s investments in equity securities totaled $284.871 billion, reflecting its continued substantial exposure to the stock market.\n\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\n\nWhy is Buffett holding so much cash?\n\nBerkshire's massive cash position has sparked questions about why Buffett isn’t seizing more investment opportunities. After all, as Grant noted, Buffett is often hailed as the world’s greatest investor. From 1964 to 2023, Berkshire achieved an extraordinary overall gain of 4,384,748%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 31,223% over the same period.\n\nBuffett has addressed the cash concern, explaining his cautious approach during Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year.\n\n“I don't think anybody sitting at this table has any idea of how to use it effectively, and therefore we don't use it,” he stated, emphasizing that “we only swing at pitches we like.”\n\nBuffett has also voiced concerns about future complexities, noting, “As the world gets more sophisticated, complicated and intertwined, more can go wrong.” He added that the company aims to be prepared to “act when that happens.”\n\nWhile some see Berkshire’s cash hoard as a defensive stance against a potential market downturn, others interpret it differently. Fund manager Chris Bloomstran told Business Insider that the situation is more nuanced.\n\nHe noted that Berkshire’s large insurance operations necessitate a substantial cash reserve to cover potential payouts. Moreover, given Berkshire’s size, its range of suitable investments is limited. Bloomstran pointed out that with Treasury bills offering decent yields, Buffett can afford to be patient.\n\n“He's limited to maybe the 100 biggest companies in the S&P 500 and maybe a handful of international businesses to be able to invest in,” Bloomstran explained. “So, his opportunity set is expensive, but he doesn't mind earning 5.3% in the interim, but it does not mean in any way, shape, or form that a stock market crash is imminent. He's just trying to find great prices stable enough to put money to work. His universe is limited.”\n\nOf course, financial prudence has always been a cornerstone of Buffett’s philosophy. In his recent letter to shareholders, Buffett emphasized that Berkshire “holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what conventional wisdom deems necessary.”\n\nThis conservative approach could prove to be a significant advantage during times of financial turmoil. Buffett highlighted that during the 2008 financial crisis, Berkshire generated cash through its operations, without relying on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets in any capacity.\n\n“We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis, but we were always prepared for one,” Buffett said, underscoring the importance of maintaining liquidity in uncertain times.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says Lock in juicy quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire.

        "title": "Apple's New iPhone 16 Didn't Seem All That Impressive. But Here's Why Its Sales Numbers Could Be Strong.",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has grown more diverse over the years with the launch of services to help enhance its top line and to expand its already robust ecosystem. But ultimately, this is still a company that relies heavily on iPhone sales, which today account for approximately half of all revenue for the company.\n\nAs Apple sells more iPhones, particularly to new customers, that also means more people are in its ecosystem and using its services. This is why the newest iPhone can be an extremely important indicator for the business' future growth, as a strong performance could lead to greater revenue on other fronts.\n\nRecently, Apple unveiled its latest phone, the iPhone 16. While it will provide users with a phone that is ready for artificial intelligence (AI) features, it may not be all that exciting. But looks can be deceiving, and early accounts are that the new iPhone is doing just fine. Here's why it could be a big growth catalyst for the business.\n\nT-Mobile CEO says sales are doing better than the iPhone 15 at this stage\n\nA good way to gauge how the iPhone is doing is by listening to what executives at major telecom companies are saying. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert isn't seeing any issues at all since the launch of the new iPhone. In a recent interview with CNBC, Sievert said sales are strong across the board: \"People are buying Pros, they're buying Maxes, so they're buying up the food chain, and they're buying at a greater rate than last year.\" He also dismissed analyst reports which suggested that sales weren't off to a strong start as \"nonsense.\"\n\nThe caveat, of course, is that the iPhone has only been available for preorder since Sept. 9. There's a possibility that people rushed to place orders in advance and due to the expectation of it being a big hit, which led to strong sales performance based solely on that anticipation. However, Sievert hasn't hinted at any drop off yet.\n\nBut with people holding on to their phones a lot longer these days due to inflation and perhaps a lack of new and compelling features from Apple in its previous iPhones, it may also not take a whole lot to convince them to finally upgrade. The promise of new AI features could be sufficient.\n\nDelaying AI features could prove to be a genius move\n\nOne thing that stood out to me in Sievert's interview is that he also believes the sales cycle could last longer than normal, simply because Apple hasn't rolled out all of its AI features yet, and they might not all be available until 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether it's by design or not, that could truly be a genius move for the company, as it may lead to multiple catalysts for the iPhone 16. The first is the launch of the phone itself, then successive ones could be the announcement of new AI features. For customers who are on the fence about upgrading right now and who may not be among those who have placed orders for the iPhone 16, news of an exciting new AI capability could be what convinces them to upgrade sooner rather than later.\n\nThrough the quarter ended June 29, Apple's iPhone sales totaled $39.3 billion, which is slightly less than the $39.7 billion it posted in the same period last year. Over the past three quarters, iPhone sales are also down by a little more than 1%.\n\nBy having some softer numbers of late, Apple could be due for some stronger quarters ahead. The reality is that it may not necessarily need a big new feature to lead to strong revenue growth. The ability for users to be able to take advantage of AI may be enough to do the trick.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock today?\n\nShares of Apple are up 18% this year, as it has largely been keeping pace with how the markets have been doing. As a leader in the smartphone market, Apple can always make for a good growth stock to buy if you're willing to hang on for the long haul.\n\nInvestors shouldn't worry too much about Apple's short-term performance from one quarter to the next. Even if this iPhone may not be the one that triggers a huge flurry of upgrades, the next one might. Regardless of how strong iPhone 16 sales prove to be, Apple remains one of the safest investments you can hold in your portfolio for the long haul.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Jim Cramer’s Bullish Stance on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL): Insights from Mike Sievert",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Now. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC yet again talked about the importance of investing in individual stocks and said with discipline and patience beginner investors can beat the market by picking solid stocks with strong fundamentals.\n\n“If you are willing to put in the work, regular people can trounce the averages as long as you are disciplined and you follow the rules,” Cramer said.\n\nTalking about his stock-picking process, Cramer said that he likes to “start” hunting for stocks by going through the list of stocks making new highs. This is a good start, according to Cramer, because a lot of times momentum keeps pushing the same stocks higher and higher unless something fundamentally changes. Cramer said he does not recommend buying stocks when they are trading at new highs. Instead, he waits for a pullback.\n\n“New high list is not a shopping list it’s an inspirational list. You keep an eye on those names and then wait for them to come down before you pull the trigger,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that you should only pile into stocks on a pullback if you believe they will rebound for reasons “unrelated to the broader market.”\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 key stocks Jim Cramer is talking about during his programs these days. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer’s Bullish Stance on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL): Insights from Mike Sievert\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer recently talked to T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and came out very hopeful on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone sales. Talking about the over sentiment after his interview, Cramer said:\n\n“Do you think he doesn’t know more about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and sales than these three stooges who said Apple has already time to go, sell it?” Cramer said.\n\nSievert told Cramer that the “first week was better than last year.”\n\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of his top picks “despite endless sources trying to shake you out of this.”\n\nShipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. “On average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they’re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meet the 3 Supercharged Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth $4 Trillion by 2025, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "One of the clearest secular tailwinds of the past couple of years is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in the field have helped power the ongoing market rally, as these next-generation algorithms promise to increase productivity by handling mundane tasks and streamlining productivity.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that many of the world's most valuable companies are at the forefront of AI development and have embraced the potential of generative AI. One of the biggest debates in tech circles is which of these technology stalwarts will be the first to cross the $4 trillion market cap threshold.\n\nInvestors asking that question may be missing the point, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who argues that 12 months from now, the $4 trillion club might, in fact, have three members. Let's take a look at the candidates and what might drive them there. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWith the world's largest current market cap, coming in at more than $3.4 trillion (as of this writing), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is among the most likely contenders to be a founding member of the $4 trillion club. It would take a stock price increase of less than 17% to put Apple over the finish line, and there are plenty of drivers that could help propel the iPhone maker higher.\n\nThe most obvious potential catalyst is, of course, the recently unveiled iPhone 16. The latest version of the fan-favorite device comes with all the usual upgrades, including an improved camera, speedier processing, and increased battery life. One of the biggest draws, however, is the debut of Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of generative AI-powered tools, which will likely attract technophiles in droves.\n\nThere's more: The rampant inflation of the past couple of years had consumers hanging on to their iPhones a bit longer, and Ives estimates there are 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded for four years or more, resulting in plenty of pent-up demand. He believes this will kick off the next supercycle and estimates Apple could sell as many as 240 million iPhones over the coming year.\n\nGiven improving macroeconomic conditions, I think the analyst is right: Throngs of consumers will pony up for the new AI-driven iPhone, helping push Apple over the $4 trillion mark.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's second-most valuable company. With a market cap of $3.2 trillion, the stock will only need to rise 24% to cross the $4 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company was quick to recognize the game-changing nature of generative AI and positioned itself for success. Microsoft took a stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and developed a suite of AI-driven productivity tools dubbed Copilot. It recently unveiled a line of Copilot-powered personal computers that will help increase Microsoft's already expansive reach.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last month, the company announced that it would restructure the reporting of its business units to give a clearer picture of its success in AI. While investors don't yet have the complete picture, the available evidence is compelling. During Microsoft's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), its Azure Cloud grew 29% year over year, and management noted that eight percentage points of that growth was the result of demand for its AI services. This helps illustrate that Microsoft's AI strategy is paying off.\n\nIves seized on one point from management's commentary, noting that Azure Cloud growth is expected to \"accelerate in the second half.\" He estimates that over the coming three years, 70% of Microsoft's installed base will be using its AI solutions. He goes on to say this opportunity is not yet fully factored into the stock price.\n\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Given Microsoft's extensive reach in both the consumer and enterprise markets, it won't take much in terms of AI adoption to positively impact the company's growth.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the de facto poster child for the AI revolution, sending its market cap to just over $3 trillion. As such, it would only take a stock price increase of 32% to take the chipmaker above $4 trillion.\n\nThe stock currently sits 10% off its peak, as investors contemplate the momentum of AI adoption, yet the evidence is incontrovertible. Nvidia's largest customers -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- have been completely transparent about their plans to increase their capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and into 2025. They have also made it very clear that the vast majority of that spending will be dedicated to the data centers and servers needed to run AI.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for running AI in data centers and controlled 98% of the data center GPU market last year. This illustrates why continued investment in the space stands to benefit Nvidia.\n\nIves cited surging chip demand, clarity on the upcoming release of its Blackwell chip, and robust outlook as proof that Nvidia stock has further to run.\n\nI think the analyst's assessment is spot on. Investors have been concerned that AI adoption could slow, which has weighed on Nvidia stock in recent months. However, while that will certainly happen one day, the available evidence suggests it won't happen any time soon. In fact, some believe Nvidia will eventually be the world's most valuable company.\n\nA word on valuation\n\nExcitement regarding the potential for AI since early last year has driven many stocks higher, resulting in a corresponding increase in their respective valuations. As such, each of these stocks is trading at a premium to the broader market. Microsoft and Apple are currently selling for roughly 33 times forward earnings, compared to a multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. Nvidia is the most egregious example, selling for 43 times forward earnings. That said, looks can be deceiving.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimates for Nvidia's earnings per share for its 2026 fiscal year (which begins in January) is $4.02. On that basis, Nvidia is only trading for 30 times sales, so it isn't as expensive as it might appear, particularly given the ongoing opportunity represented by AI. Using next fiscal year's expectations yields similar results for Apple and Microsoft, which are selling for 30 times and 28 times next year's expected earnings, respectively.\n\nWhen viewed in that light, these tech titans are actually reasonably priced. That's why each of these stocks is a must-own for the AI revolution.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Initial reports that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) latest batch of smartphones were witnessing weaker demand than last year's models weighed on the stock recently. But it looks like those reports may not hold much water after all, as the company's iPhone 16 lineup seems to be receiving a solid response from customers.\n\nMore importantly, a closer look at the potential sales prospects of the latest iPhone models indicates that Apple could witness a nice bump in sales going forward.\n\nA big upgrade cycle could help Apple sell more iPhones\n\nCounterpoint Research estimates that iPhone 16 models are witnessing robust demand in India, with sales reportedly jumping between 15% and 20% on the day the smartphones went on sale in that country. It is worth noting that Apple's sales in India surged an impressive 35% in fiscal 2024 (which ended in March this year), and the strong start that the company's latest devices are enjoying in that market suggests that the momentum is set to continue.\n\nMeanwhile, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert also pointed out that the carrier is selling more iPhone 16 models this year as compared to last year. Though Sievert pointed out that the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence could lead to a longer buying cycle, it is worth noting that the iPhone maker could eventually enjoy strong sales because of an aging installed base of iPhones.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities estimates that out of an installed base of 1.5 billion iPhones, 300 million have not been upgraded in four years. So, with generative artificial intelligence (AI) features set to make their way to the latest Apple iPhones, there is a good chance that a significant chunk of these older iPhones could be upgraded. Given that Apple sold just under 235 million iPhones last year, the stage seems set for a big jump in the company's shipments going forward.\n\nThat's why investors may want to buy shares of Apple, considering that the tech giant's growth is set to improve thanks to the arrival of its AI-enabled smartphones. However, there is another stock that's set to benefit big time from the iPhone 16's potential success, and investors can buy that company at a cheaper valuation right now -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nA shot in the arm for TSMC thanks to the new iPhones\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is the company that manufactures the processors that power Apple's iPhones. The A18 and A18 Pro processors inside the iPhone 16 models are manufactured using TSMC's 3-nanometer (nm) process node.\n\nApple claims that its iPhone Pro models can deliver 15% performance gains while consuming 20% less power than last year's models. Meanwhile, the A18 chip found on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is reportedly 30% faster and consumes 35% less power than last year's phones. The improved processing power and low consumption will play a key role in helping the new iPhones run the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features and help the company tap a fast-growing niche.\n\nApple reportedly began manufacturing its latest iPhones in June this year and ramped up their production subsequently before they hit the market this month. This is one of the reasons why TSMC has witnessed a significant bump in its revenue of late. The Taiwan-based foundry giant's monthly revenue increased 33% year over year in June, followed by a 45% increase in July and a 33% increase in August.\n\nApple is TSMC's largest customer and reportedly accounted for a fourth of the latter's top line in 2023. So it is easy to see why TSMC's revenue has been growing at impressive levels of late. Of course, Nvidia is another key TSMC customer, as the semiconductor giant has been tapping the latter's foundries to manufacture its AI chips. However, Nvidia reportedly accounted for 11% of TSMC's revenue last year, which means that Apple moves the needle in a more significant way for the foundry giant.\n\nIves expects the production of iPhone 16 models to hit 90 million units in 2024, up by 8 million to 10 million units from last year's models. This estimated increase in production by Apple seems to be contributing to TSMC's impressive growth in recent months. More importantly, we saw earlier that there is a huge installed base of users that could move to Apple's AI-enabled iPhones in the future. As a result, TSMC's largest customer could continue to play a central role in driving its growth.\n\nEven better, reports suggest that Apple may have already purchased all of TSMC's manufacturing capacity of 2-nm chips for its 2025 iPhone lineup. It is worth noting that Apple has done a similar thing in the past when it purchased all of TSMC's 3nm manufacturing capacity for a year in 2023 so that it can make enough iPhones.\n\nIn all, TSMC's growth prospects in the AI chip market thanks to customers such as Nvidia, along with its tight relationship with Apple, are the reasons why there has been a significant increase in the company's revenue estimates for the next three years. TSM Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nWhat's more, TSMC is trading at 31 times trailing earnings and 21 times forward earnings right now. It is cheaper than Apple, which is trading at 34 times trailing earnings and 30 times forward earnings. So, TSMC stock gives investors a cheaper and more diversified way to capitalize on the potential growth in iPhone sales, as well as the secular growth of the AI chip market.\n\nThis is why investors should consider buying this semiconductor stock right now before it could fly higher following the 75% gains it has already clocked in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "There's nothing wrong with the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)market index.\n\nIt reflects the overall health of the American stock market, with a quality filter based on market capitalization. Investing in this market tracker through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPDR S&P 500 Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) gives you a ton of diversification and sets you up for robust long-term returns.\n\nIf you invested $1,000 in the SPDR fund 10 years ago and set the position up to reinvest dividend payments in more shares, you would have $3,500 today. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2%, leaving inflation rates far behind. Many investors get started in a popular SPDR 500 fund and let it run for decades, building wealth with zero investor effort.\n\nBut what if I told you that there are ETFs with even better long-term returns? For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) tends to beat the S&P 500's returns in the long haul. It's one of my favorite ETFs. Let me show you how it works. VGT Total Return Price Chart\n\nWhy this Vanguard fund is one of my favorite ETFs for long-term growth\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, the Vanguard IT ETF has been crushing the S&P 500 and its index trackers over the last decade. The total returns work out to a CAGR of 20.9%. Over this period, a hypothetical $1,000 investment would have grown to $6,678.\n\nAnd that's just a simple one-time move with no further cash investments added over time. Let's imagine an automated dollar-cost averaging plan instead, starting with just $100 in the fall of 2014 and adding another $100 to that Vanguard IT ETF position per month. Some investors can do this as a paycheck deduction, others might set up automatic transfers, and a few may prefer doing it by hand.\n\nWhatever method you use, these fairly painless contributions would add up to $12,000 in a decade. The investment returns would be roughly $29,000, working out to a total investment value of $41,118.\n\nDoing the same thing with the SPDR S&P 500 fund instead would have yielded respectable results, too. The same $12,000 investment should be worth $25,174 by now, more than doubling your money in 10 years.\n\nLike I said, there's nothing wrong with that. Still, I'd rather have the stronger returns from the IT market tracker.\n\nThere's no reward without additional risks\n\nOf course, I can't promise market-stomping returns over every conceivable time period. The fund underperformed the S&P 500 in its first five years on the market, ending amid the subprime market meltdown of 2008-2009. The inflation crisis of 2022 was no fun for Vanguard IT ETF investors, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn challenging markets like these hand-picked examples, the ETF's focus on high-growth investment ideas can result in deeply negative returns. I had to search for these unfavorable examples, and this ETF tends to beat the S&P 500 over long time periods.\n\nStill, this might not be the fund for you if you can't afford the occasional price drop along the way. The fund outperforms in most cases, but it can really hurt when growth stocks run into a brick wall.\n\nHow this ETF's portfolio differs from the S&P 500\n\nThe fund follows a market index reflecting all American stocks in the information technology sector, resulting in a list of 317 names at the latest update.\n\nThey are weighted by market cap. Therefore, tech titans Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are the three largest holdings these days. These three stocks add up to roughly 48% of the total portfolio.\n\nThe same three companies also dominate the S&P 500, but their combined weight stops at just 20% right now. The IT index includes many stocks that are too small for the S&P 500.\n\nSo the IT-focused fund places a heavier load on the largest companies, but also lets smaller businesses contribute to the total score. It's a different balancing act that raises market risks but also the potential returns.\n\nIs the Vanguard Information Technology ETF right for you?\n\nYou've seen the long-term returns, and I showed you the potential downsides. I don't mind if you prefer something like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF in the end. It will probably let you sleep better at night, at least in challenging periods like the market crises I highlighted earlier.\n\nI'm just happy to have shown you a more exciting option. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF isn't every investor's cup of tea, and that's OK. I highly recommend taking a sip, though. These thrilling high-growth ideas can be intoxicating over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it’s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well.\n\nIn the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn’t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing.\n\n\"At first, I didn’t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half— a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you’ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.\"\n\nJim Cramer's 1st Investment Lesson: Know What You Own\n\nJim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses.\n\nDuring his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: \"Know what you own.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That’s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.\"\n\nFrom Childhood Curiosity to Financial Empire: The Rise of Jim Cramer\n\nJim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him.\n\nThe business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like \"open,\" \"range,\" and \"close\" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market.\n\nHis dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn’t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn’t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked.\n\nThe Stock Game\n\nNot long after, Jim introduced this \"stock game\" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing.\n\n\"Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this \"stock game\" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That’s how I fell in love with the stock market.\"\n\nJim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article delves into Jim Cramer’s latest Morning Thoughts posts which list the top stocks Cramer's watching before the markets open. After going through his posts, we sorted the picks from his watchlist by hedge fund sentiment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nAccording to the latest Morning Thoughts post, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) analysts are offering mixed opinions on the new AI-ready iPhone 16. JPMorgan pointed to the longer lead times as an indicator of strong demand, while Barclays took a more cautious view, citing less optimistic supply chain checks.\n\n\"Once again, the Apple analysts were all over the place with JPMorgan saying lead times for the new AI-ready iPhone 16 suggest healthy demand while Barclays sees more muted checks.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) presents a strong investment case due to its impressive growth in services, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), and a solid product lineup, despite facing challenges in China. In Q2 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s services segment, which includes the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Music, generated $23.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 14% increase from the previous year. This growth is driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, highlighting a stable, high-margin revenue stream that is a positive sign for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s long-term prospects.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making strides in AI integration, with significant announcements expected at its upcoming WWDC event that could enhance its AI capabilities and provide new growth opportunities. Although iPhone sales fell by 10.5% in Q2 2024 due to tough year-over-year comparisons, demand remains strong in key markets like India and Europe, helping to balance slower sales in China. The launch of upcoming products like the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro is anticipated to further drive growth into 2025.\n\nAdditionally,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is dedicated to returning value to shareholders, distributing $27 billion through dividends and share buybacks in Q2. This is supported by a $110 billion share repurchase program and a 4% increase in dividends.\n\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company’s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A fire at a major Tata Electronics plant manufacturing components for Apple iPhones in southern India halted production on Saturday, the latest in a series of incidents disrupting Apple's facilities in the region.\n\nIt is not yet clear what caused the blaze in Tata's Tamil Nadu plant.\n\nApple has been eyeing a large manufacturing base in India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017.\n\nCurrently, its products are manufactured through contracts with firms including Foxconn and Tata Electronics.\n\nThe extent of the fire's impact on Tata's supplies is still unknown.\n\nOne building where iPhone components are made caught fire, but it is unclear whether a neighbouring building where manufacturing of the complete smartphone was to start by the year-end is affected.\n\nHere's a look at other incidents in recent years that disrupted Apple facilities in India:\n\nFebruary 2024: Hundreds of workers at a manufacturing plant of Apple supplier Flex in India's Tamil Nadu state staged a one-day strike demanding higher wages for the next three years and the recognition of a union.\n\nDecember 2023: Foxconn's operations at its Indian facility near Tamil Nadu's capital, Chennai, halted for a day due to weather disruptions.\n\nSeptember 2023: Pegatron temporarily stopped iPhone assembly at its Chennai facility in the same southern Indian state after a fire at the factory.\n\nFebruary 2023: Foxlink, which manufactures iPhone chargers, suspended production at its assembly facility in Chittoor in the state of Andhra Pradesh after a fire caused part of the building to collapse.\n\nDecember 2021: Operations at a plant belonging Foxconn in Chennai city were halted for more than three weeks after 250 workers fell sick, sparking protests. Apple later found facilities did not meet required standards.\n\nDecember 2020: Workers at a Wistron plant in Karnataka state's Narsapura destroyed property during protests over non-payment of wages, causing millions of dollars in losses and forcing the Taiwanese contract manufacturer to shut the plant for three months.\n\nWistron sold its India business to the Tata Group last year.\n\n(Compiled by Blassy Boben and Krishn Kaushik; editing by Mark Potter and Clelia Oziel)",

        "title": "My Favorite \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Nvidia's Not One)",
        "content": "\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks refers to a phrase coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the cohort leading the market. They are:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nTesla lagged behind the others this year due to a decreased demand for electric vehicles, but the other six have done quite well. However, a few of them have reached points where they are no longer attractive buys, leaving only a few that I'd buy right now.\n\nThere are four stocks I'm not interested in right now\n\nIf you don't have a generative artificial intelligence (AI) product, you don't belong in this group. Although Tesla isn't actively engaged in generative AI, its AI research is focused on full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which is another worthy endeavor, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nHowever, Apple was considerably late to the AI party and couldn't even get its Apple Intelligence product ready to go for the iPhone 16 launch. Couple that with the fact that Apple is extremely expensive (30 times forward earnings) with flattening revenue growth, and it quickly falls off the list of good buys.\n\nAs mentioned, the EV market is going through a downward demand wave, so I'm not interested in Tesla.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft are quite pricey, although they may still be good investments in their own right. However, they just don't have the value of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is on the rise\n\nAmazon makes the list of stocks to buy because of its resurging cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although Amazon is expensive in its own right, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 times, it has the potential to drastically decrease that price tag thanks to AWS.\n\nDespite accounting for 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, AWS accounted for 64% of its operating profit. This means that if AWS grows at a faster pace than the rest of Amazon's business, Amazon's profits will rise at a faster pace than revenue growth. Couple that with several profit-boosting initiatives, and Amazon's case to grow profits rapidly takes form.\n\nAs a result, I'm not concerned with Amazon's price tag, and it presents itself as a very attractive buy.\n\nAlphabet is much cheaper than the market\n\nAlphabet's investment case is fairly simple: It's cheap. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system has a healthy but growing ad business, which helps fund its other endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless its AI tools really take off, Alphabet's growth isn't going to be spectacular, but it will likely be consistently in the low double digits, which is enough to provide market-beating growth. Couple that with an improving operating margin and hefty stock buybacks, and you get a stock that can consistently grow earnings in the 20% range (it grew them by over 30% in Q2).\n\nDespite this, Alphabet's stock trades for 18.6 times forward earnings, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23 times forward earnings. Alphabet has the formula to steadily outperform the S&P 500, yet trades at a discount. This is a huge mismatch, and it makes the stock a screaming buy right now.\n\nMeta is rapidly growing profits and revenue\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms sneakily posted the second-highest year-over-year revenue growth of the group over the past year (behind Nvidia's incredible growth).\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta's business is driven by ads on its social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. This allows Meta to fund its AI endeavors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.\n\nBasically, Meta is doing the same thing as Alphabet -- but at a faster pace. GOOGL Normalized Basic EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAs a result, you'll pay a slightly higher premium for Meta's stock at 23.6 times forward earnings. But I think this is a worthy premium to pay, as Meta is currently executing at a high level.\n\nEven though the Magnificent Seven have had a strong 2024, there are still reasons to buy some of the group, and I suspect that their performance will continue to be strong moving forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Incredibly Cheap Tech Stock That Could Soar 50% Thanks to Apple's Generative AI Move",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently jumped into the fast-growing market for smartphones capable of running generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Even though the latest iPhone models won't get the company's Apple Intelligence suite of features until October, the demand for its latest devices seems to be good.\n\nJPMorgan analysts point out that the delivery time delays of Apple's new iPhones are expanding, which is a sign of healthy demand for these smartphones. Meanwhile, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said he believes that Apple could sell 90 million units of its new smartphones in 2024. That's up 8 million to 10 million units when compared to last year's release.\n\nT-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert goes a step further, saying that the demand for iPhone 16 models is better than it was last year. All of this indicates that Apple could strike gold with its latest smartphones, and that won't be surprising as the market for generative AI smartphones is forecast to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 78% through 2028, according to IDC.\n\nAdditionally, there is a huge installed base of 300 million iPhones that have not been upgraded in at least four years, according to Wedbush, and that could trigger a huge upgrade cycle as customers move to generative AI smartphones.\n\nOne way investors can take advantage of the robust sales of the iPhone 16 is by buying Apple stock. However, another company could ride Apple's coattails and deliver handsome gains thanks to the iPhone 16. Let's take a closer look at it.\n\nThis Apple supplier could get a nice boost to its bottom line\n\nQorvo(NASDAQ: QRVO) is a well-known supplier of radio frequency (RF) chips used in Apple's devices such as iPhones and iPads. The chipmaker is trying to diversify its customer base and supply chips to leading Android smartphone OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), but it still got 46% of its total revenue from Apple in the previous fiscal year.\n\nAs Qorvo's fortunes appear to be intertwined with Apple's, the sunny sales prospects of the latest iPhones bode well. Even better, Qorvo could be supplying more chip content for the new iPhones and thus making more money on each unit that Apple builds.\n\nOn its fiscal 2025 first-quarter earnings conference call a couple of months ago, Qorvo management remarked that the company is investing in several long-term programs with its largest customer to increase its content and grow its business further. What's more, a report by the Chinese newspaper Economic Daily News in April this year pointed out that Apple has changed the design of the antenna module for its latest iPhone generation, thereby incorporating more chips from Qorvo.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, Qorvo's fiscal first-quarter results (for the three months ended June 29) impressed many. The company's Q1 revenue increased 36% year over year to $887 million. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.87 per share as compared to $0.34 per share last year. Qorvo completed the acquisition of Anokiwave in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and that seems to have given the chipmaker's financial performance a nice boost. Investors should note that Apple is reportedly using Anokiwave's offerings in its latest iPhones to improve signal reception.\n\nQorvo, therefore, could benefit from a combination of stronger volume shipments and more revenue per unit from the new iPhone models. As a result, the margin improvement that Qorvo is seeing of late is likely to continue. QRVO Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nThis improvement in the company's margin profile is expected to lead to healthy growth in the company's earnings over the next couple of years. QRVO EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nInvestors can expect Qorvo stock to deliver solid gains\n\nThe chart above indicates that Qorvo's bottom line could increase at an annual rate of 28% in the next two fiscal years. Assuming Qorvo's earnings indeed jump to $10.25 per share after three years and it trades at 15 times forward earnings at that time (in line with its five-year average forward earnings multiple), its stock price could increase to $154. That would be a jump of nearly 50% from current levels.\n\nInterestingly, Qorvo currently trades at 15 times forward earnings, a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average earnings multiple of 45. That's why investors should consider buying this undervalued semiconductor stock hand over fist, as the strong sales of Apple's iPhones are set to improve Qorvo's earnings power and could send its shares soaring over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qorvo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qorvo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qorvo wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tata iPhone component plant disrupted by fire, 10 given medical aid",
        "content": "By Haripriya Suresh and Praveen Paramasivam\n\nHOSUR, India (Reuters) - At least 10 people received medical treatment, with two hospitalised, after a major fire on Saturday disrupted production at a key Tata Electronics plant in southern India which makes Apple iPhone components.\n\nThe incident is the latest to affect Apple's iPhone supply chain just as the company is looking to diversify beyond China and sees India as a key growth market. It is also the latest in a string of incidents to affect Apple suppliers in India over the last few years.\n\nThe fire occurred at the plant in the city of Hosur in Tamil Nadu state which makes some iPhone components. It broke out near another building inside the Tata complex which will in coming months turn out complete iPhones.\n\nThe fire was contained to one building and has been extinguished fully, top district administrative official K.M. Sarayu said. No decision has been made on when manufacturing can restart, she said.\n\n\"Fumes are still coming since it's a chemical hazard. It will take time for the search and rescue team to go inside and do an assessment. We have to wait till tomorrow,\" she added.\n\nSarayu said that 523 workers were on shift when the fire broke out in the early morning and that all workers had been evacuated and accounted for.\n\nSavitri, an eyewitness who lives near the plant and only gave her first name, said she heard \"loud sounds around 5.30 a.m. (midnight GMT) that sounded like crackers going off. After that we just saw plumes of smoke from the building, and there was thick smoke till at least 10 in the morning.\"\n\nEMERGENCY PROTOCOLS\n\nTata Electronics is one of the major contract makers of iPhones in India, along with Foxconn. The company said it was investigating the cause of the fire and would take the necessary steps to safeguard employees and other stakeholders.\n\n\"Our emergency protocols at the plant ensured that all employees are safe,\" a Tata Electronics spokesperson said.\n\nJ. Saravanan, a senior district official charged with handling industrial safety, said it was not yet possible to say when production at the facility will resume, as \"we will need to go in to understand more, depending on the damage.\"\n\nHe said the injuries were all related to smoke inhalation but give no further detail.\n\nProduction was halted and employees sent home for the day following the fire, a person with direct knowledge of the incident said earlier, describing the blaze as chemical-related.\n\nA second industry source said it was not yet clear if a neighbouring building where smartphone manufacturing was due to start by year-end had also been affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the facility inaccessible at the moment, the source said, an assessment of damage from the fire will have to be done later.\n\nApple made no immediate comment on the incident.\n\nThe fire began in an area used to store chemicals, a fire official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nLast year, Apple supplier Foxlink halted production at its assembly facility in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh after a massive fire led part of the building to collapse.\n\n(Additional reporting by Krishn Kaushik, Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and David Holmes)\n\nView comments",

Apple is considering a similar strategy for subsequent releases, including the World War II drama Blitz.\n\nHowever, the streaming business emerged as a battleground led by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), with Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fighting for market share.\n\nNetflix had a market share of 22% in subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) services in the second quarter of 2024. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) streaming service Disney+ followed with a market share of 11% and Apple TV+ at 9%, as per Statista.\n\nNetflix spends $17 billion annually on content and eyes over $600 billion in revenue opportunity.\n\nDisney scored a big win in 2024 with proven franchises Deadpool & Wolverine, grossing $1.32 billion, and Inside Out 2 clocking $1.69 billion globally, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nComcast Corp’s (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Despicable Me 4, another proven franchise, grossed $0.95 billion.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - A federal judge narrowed a lawsuit accusing Apple of violating the privacy of iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users by collecting their personal data through proprietary apps such as the App Store, Apple Music and Apple TV.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California, dismissed nearly all claims based on the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" setting on Apple mobile devices, but let some claims proceed over the \"Share [Device] Analytics\" setting.\n\nMobile device users said Apple violated their user agreements and several privacy and consumer protection laws by assuring that disabling the settings would limit its collection, storage and use of their data - only to then ignore their choices and collect, store and use that data.\n\nThe lawsuit seeking unspecified damages is one of many accusing technology companies such as Apple, Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms' Facebook of allowing the collection of user data without consent.\n\nIn a 39-page decision late Thursday, Davila said Apple made clear to users that the \"Allow Apps to Request to Track\" setting applied to \"other companies' apps and websites.\"\n\nHe said that made it \"implausible\" for reasonable people to believe that by turning the setting off, they were withdrawing consent for Apple to collect their data through its own apps.\n\nBut the judge said users plausibly alleged they withdrew such consent by disabling the \"Share [Device] Analytics\" setting, citing Apple's disclosure that users may \"disable the sharing of Device Analytics altogether.\"\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has said it collects data through that setting to improve its products and services.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe case is In re Apple Data Privacy Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-07069.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Investors Unfazed by Tepid Demand for AI-Powered iPhone",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A tepid response from shoppers to the iPhone 16 has not dented investors’ enthusiasm for Apple Inc. shares, which enjoyed a multi-month rally in anticipation of the launch.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\nThe model went on sale this month, though the highly touted artificial-intelligence tools won’t arrive as software updates until October. Data on pre-orders and lead times have been cautious, analysts say, suggesting the most optimistic expectations for an upgrade cycle may be out of reach at the moment.\n\nEven so, Apple stock has managed to dodge the volatility its Big Tech peers have experienced recently, and much of Wall Street still expects the AI iPhones to trigger an acceleration in growth.\n\nJack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, is among those betting the upgrade cycle will materialize eventually. While acknowledging the iPhone launch was less strong than hoped, “it won’t even be a speed bump in the company’s long-term progress,” he reckons.\n\n“Apple has so many cylinders that support the stock, and if one of them trips up in the short term, others can keep going,” Ablin said. “It is a high-quality company with predictable earnings and massive cash flow, and even if it’s a little expensive, it still scans as a safe haven against a macro backdrop that has some question marks.”\n\nThat confidence has lifted Apple shares nearly 40% off their April lows, adding $911 billion to the company’s market capitalization. The stock price is just 3% under a record high hit in July, while other megacaps such as Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., and Alphabet Inc., are further away from their all-time peaks.\n\nThe view of Apple as a relative haven among equities stems from its track record of steady earnings growth, even during rockier economic periods. It repurchases stock regularly and in large amounts — a buyback announced in May was the largest ever in the US. Finally, it hasn’t engaged in the kind of heavy AI-related capex other megacaps have undertaken; such spending has been increasingly questioned by investors.\n\nApple screens favorably in terms of quality, profitability, buybacks, and momentum, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Meanwhile, the CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for the stock, has been trending lower and is under its 10-year average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe flip side is that it scores poorly on value and growth. Apple trades near 31 times estimated earnings, more than 50% above its 10-year average, and notably above the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 26. Its price-to-sales ratio recently hit the highest since at least 2000.\n\nThe growth issue is particularly significant, given the upgrade cycle isn’t playing out yet. Apple’s revenue has dropped in five of the past seven quarters, and analysts predict it will rise just 1.8% in its 2024 fiscal year, before accelerating to 7.9% the following year.\n\nAll that suggests the stock’s rally could be vulnerable if the hoped-for upgrade cycle doesn’t come through. For such reasons, just two-thirds of analysts recommend buying Apple shares, compared with ratios near or above 90% for Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nAs for the iPhone 16, multiple analysts have flagged early data points, including on pre-orders and lead times, as signs of lower demand.\n\n“In totality, these data points are more negative than positive for the iPhone 16 cycle, though they still have little predictive power over the full cycle,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence, citing a survey it conducted, as well as daily tracking of iPhone lead times, expects “roughly 230 million iPhone units will be sold in fiscal 2025, for growth of 3%,” below a prior expectation of 5% growth. As a result, analyst Anurag Rana wrote, revenue gains may be 200 basis points below consensus.\n\nFor Ed Egilinsky, managing director at Direxion Funds, it’s worth waiting to see how demand for the new handset plays out, especially when the AI tools are added.\n\n“Apple certainly has a great business, and it is one of the premier stocks in the market, but it is priced richly given its growth prospects,” he said. “People need to be aware that just because it’s a bellwether that has been viewed as defensive, it can still face downside.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nMicron Technology Inc. shares soared 15% on Thursday, their biggest one-day percentage gain since December 2011. The rally came after the chipmaker gave a robust forecast, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence products.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nArm Holdings Plc approached Intel Corp. about potentially buying the ailing chipmaker’s product division, only to be told that the business isn’t for sale, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. DirecTV and Dish are in advanced talks to merge in a deal that would create the largest US pay-TV provider, with almost 20 million subscribers, people familiar with the matter said. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., JD.com Inc. and Meituan enjoyed their best trading days in years after the Chinese government announced measures to stimulate the troubled domestic economy. Tokyo Electron Ltd. seeks to build a team of chip engineers in India to better ride the Modi government’s push for more semiconductor manufacturing in the world’s most populous country.\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft The End of the Cheap Burger This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last).

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\n\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\n\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\n\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\n\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\n\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\n\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American technology company headquartered in California, which is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related services. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now, with 184 hedge funds holding a stake in the company at the end of Q2 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database.\n\nThe recently concluded third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was one of the best quarters for the company in a long while, during which it reported a June quarter record revenue of $85.8 billion, up 5% compared to the same period last year. Revenue from products totaled $61.6 billion, representing a 2% year-over-year increase. The growth was aided by the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion during Q3, up 14% from last year. The company reported a gross margin of 46.3%, which fell within the higher range of guidance for the quarter. EPS was measured at $1.40, beating estimates of $1.35 per share.\n\nThe company generated $39.3 billion from the sale of iPhones, which accounted for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue for the quarter. However, the figure was down 1% year-over-year. This was likely due to a 6.5% drop in sales from Greater China, where the iPhone faces fierce competition from local manufacturers like Huawei. Mac revenue reached $7 billion, up 2% from last year. The biggest success story for the quarter came from iPad, which registered a 24% revenue growth to a total of $7.2 billion.\n\nWhile the decline in iPhone sales has created some bearish sentiment around the stock, most investors are bullish on the company in anticipation of the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the new iPhone 16. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nStreet analysts have maintained a consensus Buy rating on the stock and a share price target of $242.41, representing a 5.89% upside from its current trading level.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Are Street Analysts Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL) Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other active stocks.\n\nAre Additional Rate Cuts a Necessity?\n\nThe economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants.\n\nAs stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%.\n\nHe referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses.\n\nFurther discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...”\n\nHowever, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts.\n\nIn a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial.\n\nKantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary.\n\nHe noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support.\n\nLooking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability.\n\nKantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nVolume: 10.573 million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 56.172 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational corporation best known for its consumer electronics, software, and online services. Famous products include the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, renowned for their focus on user experience, innovative design, and ecosystem of services including the App Store and Apple Music.\n\nThe revenue in FQ3 2024 rose by 4.87% year-over-year, with the services division setting a record at $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, despite a slight decline. Moreover, Mac revenue grew by 2% to $7 billion, and iPad revenue by 24% year-over-year.\n\nShipments for the latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to UBS data. Delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are shorter than last year in major markets.\n\nIn the US, wait times for the iPhone 16 are 26 days, down from 40 days last year. In China, they're 18 days compared to 36. Despite upcoming Apple Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nJust a few weeks after launching the new iPhone with Apple Intelligence, the company is likely to unveil new versions of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini in October. These computers will also come pre-loaded with Apple Intelligence and are expected to rival AI workloads of PCs announced by Microsoft. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) debuted Apple Intelligence in June, its first step into the world of GenAI.\n\nDespite potential challenges related to iPhone upgrade cycles and the services business, the company's strong brand recognition, innovative product lineup, and expanding ecosystem position it well for continued growth.\n\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company’s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "The Apple(NasdaqGS:AAPL) is currently navigating a complex environment marked by both growth and challenges. Recent developments include a record June quarter revenue of $85.8 billion and significant investments in AI technology, contrasted by a slight decline in iPhone and Wearables revenue and concerns over valuation. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Apple's financial health, key weaknesses, growth opportunities, and external threats to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\n\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of Apple. NasdaqGS:AAPL Share price vs Value as at Sep 2024\n\nStrengths: Core Advantages Driving Sustained Success For Apple\n\nApple's financial health is highlighted by its impressive revenue growth and profitability. The company reported a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from the previous year. This growth was achieved across multiple markets, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Services revenue reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year, showcasing the strength of Apple's diversified business model. Customer satisfaction remains exceptionally high, with the iPhone 15 family achieving a 98% satisfaction rate in the U.S. Moreover, Apple is trading at 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26, suggesting potential for value appreciation despite a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to industry peers.\r\n\r\nTo gain deeper insights into Apple's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\n\nWeaknesses: Critical Issues Affecting Apple's Performance and Areas For Growth\n\nApple faces several challenges. The company's iPhone revenue decreased by 1% year-over-year to $39.3 billion, and revenue from Wearables, Home, and Accessories fell by 2% to $8.1 billion. Additionally, Apple's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 33.9x is significantly higher than the Global Tech industry average of 21.4x, indicating that it might be overvalued compared to its peers. Gross margin pressure is also a concern, with the products gross margin dropping 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by product mix and partially offset by favorable costs. Furthermore, Apple's earnings growth over the past year (7.6%) did not outperform the Tech industry average of 31.4%.\r\n\r\nTo dive deeper into how Apple's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Apple's Valuation.\n\nOpportunities: Potential Strategies for Leveraging Growth and Competitive Advantage\n\nApple has several opportunities to enhance its market position and capitalize on emerging trends. The company is making significant investments in Apple Intelligence, aiming to unlock the full potential of AI technology. New product launches, such as the all-new 11- and 13-inch iPad Air, demonstrate Apple's commitment to innovation. Expansion into emerging markets, including the opening of its first location in Malaysia, offers growth potential. Increased engagement in services is also notable, with both transacting and paid accounts reaching new all-time highs, growing double digits year-over-year. These strategic moves are expected to bolster Apple's competitive advantage and drive future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThreats: Key Risks and Challenges That Could Impact Apple's Success\n\nApple faces several external threats that could impact its long-term success. Currency fluctuations pose a significant risk, with a negative foreign exchange impact of 230 basis points already affecting revenue growth. The competitive environment, particularly in the global tech market, remains intense. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, such as ongoing foreign exchange headwinds, are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Significant insider selling over the past three months also raises concerns about potential internal challenges. These factors highlight the need for Apple to navigate external pressures carefully to sustain its market leadership.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple's strong financial health, evidenced by its record revenue and high customer satisfaction, underscores its resilience and potential for value appreciation, especially as it trades 5.3% below its estimated fair value of $240.26. However, challenges such as declining iPhone and Wearables revenue, a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio, and gross margin pressures indicate areas needing strategic focus. The company's investments in AI, new product launches, and expansion into emerging markets present significant opportunities for future growth. Nonetheless, external threats like currency fluctuations and intense competition necessitate careful navigation to maintain its market leadership and drive sustained success.\n\nTurning Ideas Into Actions\n\nIs Apple part of your asset mix?

        "title": "Tokyo Electron Prepares India Expansion as Modi Lures Chipmakers",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tokyo Electron Ltd. seeks to build a team of chip engineers in India to better ride the Modi government’s push for more semiconductor manufacturing in the world’s most populous country.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\nJapan’s biggest chip equipment maker plans to hire and train local engineers in or around 2026, with their first task to provide technical services to Tata Electronics Pvt, Chief Executive Officer Toshiki Kawai said. Robotics will play a growing role and local staff will be provided with in-person and remote support from Japan, he added, declining to specify how many people the company would need to hire.\n\nIndia is amping up efforts to attract international electronics companies and chipmakers to set up facilities within its borders, under a plan by the Narendra Modi administration to close the tech gap with advanced economies. Apple Inc. is accelerating its production and sales of iPhones in the country, while Tata Group and others are investing billions of dollars in semiconductor fabrication plants. The government is providing incentives to support those ventures, which will need machinery and knowhow from companies like Tokyo Electron.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company targets 10,000 new hires globally over the next five years, as more countries race to build chips at home. Tokyo Electron supplies gear to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Samsung Electronics Co., SK Hynix Inc. and Intel Corp., and its forecast for the business year to March points to record revenue and operating profit. It also expects overall chip demand to double by 2030, boosted by artificial intelligence, autonomous cars and a push toward energy efficiency and carbon neutrality.\n\nThat’s even as the US pressures Japan to further tighten restrictions on exports of advanced chipmaking gear to China, part of an extended effort to curb its technological progress. US officials have sought to limit Tokyo Electron’s ability to service some of its machines in China and have talked of invoking the foreign direct product rule, or FDPR, which allows Washington to control sales of products made anywhere in the world if they use even a small amount of American technology.\n\nSuch moves won’t affect global appetite for chipmaking machines, 61-year-old Kawai said. “The importance of semiconductors remains unchanged,” he said in an interview. “There will always be investment somewhere.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTokyo Electron said earlier this month it will help train Tata Electronics’ workforce on chipmaking equipment and support its research and development. Modi’s administration has so far approved more than $15 billion worth of semiconductor investments, including US memory maker Micron Technology Inc.’s plan for a $2.75 billion assembly facility. Israel’s Tower Semiconductor Ltd. is also seeking to partner with billionaire Gautam Adani on a $10 billion fabrication plant in western India.\n\nSales to China, which surged to around 50% of Tokyo Electron’s revenue in the June quarter, will likely fall to less than 40% in October-March, and comprise around 25% to 30% in the future as overall sales of equipment rise, Kawai said.\n\n“India won’t replace the Chinese market. It would be growth in addition to China,” he said.\n\nTokyo Electron, which makes machines that develop, pattern and clean silicon, is focusing on expanding its market share against rival Applied Materials Inc. The company’s seeking certification for mass production of cryogenic etching, which can process stacked NAND memory at high speeds and is an area led by US competitor Lam Research Corp. The Japanese firm has also acquired certification to develop conductor etching for DRAM and cleaning equipment for advanced logic chips.\n\nTokyo Electron’s stock price has tumbled since hitting a record high in April, and shares are now up just around 2% this year, partly due to fluctuations in investor sentiment toward AI.\n\n“The market focuses too much on AI,” Kawai said. “There’s so much potential for growth.”\n\n--With assistance from Shery Ahn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft The End of the Cheap Burger This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.62%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.6%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have depreciated by 0.05% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.91% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.71%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.60, marking a 9.59% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $94.52 billion, indicating a 5.61% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $6.70 per share and a revenue of $390.63 billion, indicating changes of +9.3% and +1.92%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

        "title": "Wall Street fears lower-than-anticipated iPhone demand as shipping times shrink",
        "content": "It’s been a week since Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 16 lineup went on sale, and Wall Street isn’t happy with the early results. That’s because shipping times for the company’s latest smartphones are shorter than prior years. And while that might be good for consumers, it could also indicate that demand for Apple’s latest smartphones is lower than it was for their predecessors.\n\nThe thinking is that if customers can easily get their hands on the new iPhones, then there’s a relative glut of phones available to purchase versus last year.\n\n“Typically, at this point in the launch cycle, wait times at the high end have ticked higher sequentially as demand remained somewhat stable,” UBS analyst David Vogt wrote in an investor note Tuesday.\n\n“However, wait times in the US for the high-end 16s (Pro and Pro Max) did not notably tick higher like the wait times for the high-end 14 and 15s.”\n\nMorgan Stanley Research’s Erik Woodring provided a similar observation in his note to investors, writing that as of Tuesday, 11 days after iPhone preorders went live, iPhone 16 lead times continued to track lower than previous iPhone sales cycles.\n\nWoodring said that the average iPhone 16 lead time stood at 15.2 days compared to an average of 25.7 days for all iPhone 15 models last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14 line, based on Morgan Stanley's checks. Models of iPhone 16 are on display at the Apple Store in Regent Street, central London, as the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max go on sale, alongside other Apple Watch products, Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. (James Manning/PA via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nImportantly, Woodring pointed out that the iPhone 16 doesn’t appear to be impacted by the kinds of supply constraints that caused a slowdown in iPhone shipments in recent years but added that Apple generally overbuilds its number of iPhones ahead of launch.\n\nTaken together, the early outlook for Apple’s iPhone 16 sales appears troubling. But there are two other points to take into consideration. The first is that Apple may have simply prepared better for iPhone demand this time around, which means it’s able to ship them out more quickly than in previous years.\n\nThe second point is that iPhone customers could simply be holding off on grabbing an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro because Apple Intelligence isn’t available yet. This year’s flagship feature for the iPhone, Apple Intelligence is set to launch later this fall, with additional capabilities added throughout 2025.\n\nThe first batch of features, coming in October, will include a revamped version of Siri, summarizations for text messages and other notifications, and word options to reword and summarize text documents.\n\nWhile the latest iPhones don’t include Apple Intelligence, they are still excellent smartphones. The updated cameras and improved photo style options are great touches. And the improved battery life and addition of the Action Button to the base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 plus are welcomed upgrades.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with Apple’s promise that Apple Intelligence will fundamentally change what users are able to do with their iPhones, consumers may feel as though upgrading right away isn’t worth the trouble and could instead make the switch when Apple Intelligence launches in October.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that while the first initial weeks of iPhone sales can provide a sense of early demand for Apple’s latest smartphones, the holiday season is typically the most important indicator of how consumers are reacting to the devices. If sales slow during that period, Apple will truly have something to worry about. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman focus on value, and others like Ken Fisher focus on growth, Asness’ fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\n\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock’s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock’s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock’s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\n\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital’s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\n\nThese returns ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\n\nLooking at the returns for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are plotted over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\n\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund’s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return’s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022 according to Bloomberg,\n\nAQR’s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey’s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund’s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as Citadel Wellington, Point72, and Millennium 5.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\n\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness’ top stock picks, it’s also important to see how his firms’ funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed’s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% – 3.50% by 2025 end.\n\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR’s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index’s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark’s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks “considered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe” has been the way to go so far in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital’s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey’s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 184\n\nAQR Funds’ Latest Investment Stake: $1.73 billion\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) dominates the global consumer electronics industry courtesy of the iPhone. SEC filings show that 52% of the firm’s revenue comes from smartphones. Consequently, the iPhone is the central pillar on which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s hypothesis rests as it allows the firm to have a user base of roughly 1.46 billion users. This user base is used by investors to gauge the firm’s future revenue by estimating when these users will upgrade their devices. The iPhone’s strength has also enabled Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to create a $78 billion Services business by providing software service and taking payments from Google to make Google Search the default platform on its devices. Consequently, investors are also evaluating Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its ability to monetize consumer AI services through Apple Intelligence. Furthermore, any iPhone upgrade weakness or government action that stops Google’s payments could spell trouble for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Analysis-Power thirst complicates ESG investors' love affair with tech stocks",
        "content": "By Isla Binnie\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who manage hundreds of billions of dollars are pressing Microsoft, Alphabet and others for more information on the power needed for artificial intelligence and advanced computing, to help decide whether the sector should stay heavily represented in sustainable funds, investors said.\n\nWhile these conversations are at an early stage, six fund industry executives in Europe and the United States said they are looking more closely at the environmental impact of the AI boom, which Goldman Sachs estimates will boost data center power demand 160% by 2030.\n\nNone of the investors contacted by Reuters said they were considering divesting.\n\nSome of the biggest tech companies leading the AI race that requires building and powering data centers have started reporting increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising questions from asset managers who want to show their portfolios do well not only financially but also by the environment. Tech's thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\n\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\n\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union's financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\n\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\n\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\n\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\n\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\n\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\n\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\n\nStory continues\n\nBIG SHIFT\n\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\n\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\n\nNordea's 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\n\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley's Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\n\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\n\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA CHALLENGE\n\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\n\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\n\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert's Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\n\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\n\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\n\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\n\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\n\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\n\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Top 3 Bond ETFs to Buy With Interest Rates Falling",
        "content": "Bond ETFs are an attractive option with interest rates falling. Bond ETFs have generally outperformed equity benchmarks in recent months. Here are three good options to diversify your portfolio with bond ETFs.\n\nThese bond ETFs should benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nBonds have always been a good way to diversify a portfolio, but in the current environment, some bond ETFs have the added benefit of generating returns that beat many stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter, bonds outperformed stocks, as the S&P 500 Bond Index returned 5.9% since July 1, while the S&P 500 has returned 5%. This is due in large part to higher volatility in the stock market caused by high valuations.\n\nBut with interest rates starting to decline, the market for bonds is expected to get even better. That’s because bond prices rise when interest rates fall. So, the best time to generate high returns from a bond ETF is to invest when interest rates are high but coming down — like they are now. This allows you as an investor to lock in high coupon yields and watch the value of bonds increase when rates fall.\n\n“The all-important starting yields are higher than they’ve been for a long time and interest rates are likely ready to come down, starting in the second half of 2024 and continuing into next year. That’s the combination we’ve been waiting for,” David Braun, manager of the PIMCO Active Bond ETF, said in recent commentary from Fidelity Investments. “This is perhaps the most excited and bullish I’ve been on US core bonds in 15 years.”\n\nHere are three of the best bond ETFs to buy now.\n\n1. PIMCO Active Bond ETF\n\nThe PIMCO Active Bond ETF (NYSE:BOND) stands out for its historical performance as well as its active management, which will allow the portfolio management team, led by Braun, to find the most compelling bond investments.\n\nThe ETF focuses on higher-quality, intermediate-term bonds, selected using PIMCO’s top-down and bottom-up investment approach. The top-down strategy looks for forces likely to influence the economy and financial markets over the next three to five years, while the bottom-up approach drives the security selection process.\n\nCurrently, 58% of the portfolio is in securitized bonds, while 24% is in investment-grade credit and 13% is in U.S. government bonds. Around 54% have maturities of 5 to 10 years, while 17% mature in 3 to 5 years, and 15% have maturities of 1 to 3 years.\n\nThe ETF has a one-year return of 8.5%, which beats the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Index one-year return of 7.3%. It has a 10-year average annualized return of 2.01%, beating the benchmark’s return of 1.64%.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Vanguard Long-Term Bond Fund\n\nThe Vanguard Long-Term Bond Fund (NYSE:BLV) is focused on long-term U.S. Treasury and U.S. government bonds, which should serve it well as rates continue to fall.\n\nLonger term bonds typically are more sensitive to rate changes than short-term bonds. When rates rise, they are more negatively impacted, but when rates start to fall, they generate higher returns because they pay the higher locked in rate for longer.\n\nThe ETF is passively managed, tracking the Bloomberg U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index. About 49% of this ETF is in longer-term U.S. government bonds, including Treasury and agency bonds. It also has exposure to investment-grade bonds.\n\nThe fund is up about 1.5% year-to-date, but it has surged over the past three months, returning 6.7%, beating the leading equity benchmarks. That type of performance should continue in this falling-rate environment.\n\n3. iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF\n\nThe iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:IGLB) is a solid choice right now, for many of the same reasons as the Vanguard Long-Term Bond Fund.\n\nBut while that ETF focuses mainly on longer duration U.S. government bonds, the iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF invests in mostly long-term, investment grade corporate debt with maturities of 10 years or more.\n\nInvestment-grade corporate bonds are those issued by large, well-capitalized, often blue-chip companies, so while they are not as safe as U.S. Treasury bonds, they do generally have higher yields than U.S. government bonds because they are a bit riskier.\n\nHowever, they are not as risky as high yield, or junk bonds. Currently, the largest holdings in the portfolio are solid companies like AT&T (NYSE:T), UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Investors should feel fairly confident that these companies won’t default and that returns should rise due to falling interest rates.\n\nThe ETF is up just 1.7% YTD but has gained about 5.1% over the past three months. It has returned 10.2% over the past year and has posted a 2.5% average annualized return over the past 10 years. But with rates falling, it should see higher-than-average returns going forward.\n\nBond ETFs are always a good diversifier, but investors may want to increase their allocations slightly for what appears to be a relatively strong market for bonds right now.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThe Top 3 Bond ETFs to Buy With Interest Rates Falling\n\n3 Stocks That Can Gain From Chinaâ€™s Stimulus Plans\n\nThis Under-the-Radar Sector Is Getting Ready to Take Flight Amid Falling Rates\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Australia Wheat Crop Dealt Another Blow as Cold Snap Hits South",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Severe frosts have threatened fields in Australia’s south and southeast that were expected to account for more than 10% of the major shipper’s wheat production, compounding concerns over dryness in western regions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\nTemperatures this month reached negative 2C (28F) across almost 1.2 million hectares of wheat fields that were mostly located in New South Wales state, according to crop forecaster Digital Agricultural Services. Frost is particularly damaging for mature wheat crops that are in their final growth stage before harvest, which in Australia usually begins in November.\n\nThe area was initially expected to produce 3.2 million tons of wheat, but that could be slashed by between 10% and 60%, according to the Melbourne-based company’s chief data scientist, Sam Atkinson. Quality was also likely to decrease, he said, cautioning that there was no way to be sure until harvest began. The towns of Temora, Wagga Wagga and Young were worst affected, he added.\n\nAlthough Australia recently forecast this season’s wheat crop at 31.8 million tons, dry conditions in the country’s west — combined with the recent frosts — could cut output to less than 29 million tons, according to Atkinson. A reduction in wheat supplies from the nation could add to concerns about global stockpiles, which are expected to fall to the tightest in nine years.\n\nThe wheat crop of grain and pulse farmer Daniel Keam had already been battered by dry weather in recent months, so it was an unwelcome surprise last week when he saw some of the tips of his plants turning white. Since then, the top half of some heads had frozen over, and he was expecting to produce 25% less wheat than he’d originally expected.\n\nDying Stems\n\nSome other farmers near his property in Wallup — a small town about halfway between Adelaide and Melbourne — hadn’t been so lucky, he said.\n\n“They’re having to cut their wheat in hopes to sell it as hay just to break even,” Keam said. In many cases, frost had developed along the whole wheat stem, cutting off the plant’s ability to receive nutrients and ultimately causing it to die, he said.\n\nFurther frosts were forecast for Friday morning in South Australia’s Murraylands district and some southern regions in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory, according the the Bureau of Meteorology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore than 350,000 hectares of barley crops expected to produce 1 million tons, along with 540,000 hectares of canola expected to produce 1.25 million tons, had also been impacted by frosts, Atkinson said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "title": "Australian Banks, Households Resilient to High Rates, RBA Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The share of Australian borrowers in severe financial stress remains small with the vast majority still able to service their debts, the Reserve Bank said in a half-yearly review, while highlighting other areas of threat to the banking system including from China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\n“The risk of widespread financial stress remains limited due to generally strong financial positions of most borrowers,” the RBA said in its Financial Stability Review released in Sydney on Thursday. “Very few mortgage borrowers are in negative equity, limiting the impact on lenders in the event of default and supporting their ability to continue providing credit to the economy.”\n\nThe RBA cautioned that domestic vulnerabilities could increase if households responded to any easing in financial conditions by taking on excessive debt. It noted that periods of low or falling interest rates historically have coincided with borrowers taking on higher levels of debt and in some cases lenders extending credit to risky borrowers.\n\n“International experience has highlighted the danger of boom-bust asset price cycles, particularly those amplified by the widespread use of borrowed money,” the RBA said. “Residential property stands out in this regard.”\n\nAustralian households are under pressure as most are on floating-rate mortgages, meaning the 4.25 percentage points of rate increases between May 2022 and November 2023 rapidly passed through to increases in loan repayments. The RBA has kept its cash rate at a 12-year high of 4.35% this year and has signaled it will remain at that level for the time being.\n\nThe RBA said Thursday that Australian banks are resilient and even though lenders anticipate an increase in loan arrears, their capital and liquidity buffers are well above regulatory requirements.\n\nMany businesses also continue to manage pressure on their cash flows and balance sheets, supported by sturdy finances prior to the inflation breakout of 2021, the review showed. Most businesses that have entered insolvency are small and have little debt, limiting the broader impact on the labor market and thus household incomes, and on the capital position of lenders.\n\n“Financial pressures are expected to ease,” the RBA said, pointing to tax cuts that kicked in on July 1 and slower inflation. “However, the expected easing in labor market conditions and subdued growth in activity are likely to present challenges for some households and businesses.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost mortgagors have experienced an increase in minimum scheduled payments of 30%-60% since May 2022, when the current interest rate tightening campaign began. Even so, less than 1% of all owner-occupier housing loan balances are 90+ days in arrears. Around 0.5% of loans in arrears are estimated to be in negative equity.\n\nThe share of floating-rate owner-occupier borrowers estimated to have had essential expenses and scheduled mortgage repayments exceed their income, leading to an estimated cash flow shortfall, has remained around 5%.\n\nIf inflation was to remain high for longer than forecast, the share of borrowers most at risk of being unable to service their debts would increase only slightly, the review found. A larger-than-expected increase in unemployment would lead to greater financial stress though risks to the broader financial system would likely remain contained, it said.\n\nThe semi-annual review identified Australia’s massive superannuation sector as an area of risk to the financial system, given its rapid growth in recent years and increased exposure to margin calls.\n\nOther areas of risk include:\n\nOperational vulnerabilities from digitization of the financial system Low risk premia in global credit and equity markets leaves them vulnerable to a disorderly adjustment Imbalances in China’s financial sector could spill over to the rest of its economy, and to Australia and the world, through trade and global risk aversion channels\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "content": "Investment firms managing over $100 million in stocks are required to file a form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once quarterly. These filings can be helpful as they provide a glimpse into what the companies' sophisticated investors, such as hedge fund managers, are buying and selling.\n\nOne investor I enjoy following is Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management. Last quarter, Point72 sold about 600,000 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock -- reducing its stake by 16%. At the same time, the hedge fund initiated a position in another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), buying almost 1.6 million shares.\n\nLet's dig into what may have driven these moves and assess whether Apple deserves a spot in your portfolio as well.\n\nWhy sell Amazon stock right now?\n\nAlthough Amazon is known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing enterprise, its ecosystem also spans advertising, streaming and entertainment, subscription services, and so much more. Considering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to upend so many different end markets, it's not surprising to see that Amazon is emerging at the forefront of the AI conversation.\n\nSimply put, the technology has a chance to ignite all sorts of new growth opportunities for one of the world's largest and most diversified businesses -- and Amazon is making a lot of moves. For example, it invested $4 billion in a start-up called Anthropic. A cornerstone of this relationship is that Anthropic will train future versions of its large language models (LLM) on Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia semiconductor chips.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon recently announced an $11 billion infrastructure investment to build its own data centers in Indiana. This investment comes on the heels of Amazon's acquisition of a nuclear-powered data center back in March.\n\nAll told, Amazon is spending a lot of money on various AI initiatives. While I can't say for certain what drove Cohen and his team's calculus to trim the position in Amazon, it could be that the company's aggressive spending across the AI realm has inspired some questions regarding the return on these investments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy buy Apple stock right now?\n\nFor more than a year, Apple has struggled to demonstrate consistent revenue growth across both its line-up of products and in different geographic markets. While this dynamic has caused some to doubt Apple's growth prospects, I'd say the company's financial trends make some sense from a macro standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh levels of inflation and a rising interest rate environment have caused consumers in the U.S. to scale back on spending over the last couple of years. Moreover, a sluggish economy in China -- one of Apple's largest markets -- has been a theme from a global perspective that's impacted the company. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, all hope is not lost for Apple. In fact, the company could be looking at a couple of different catalysts right now.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone 16 launch is currently underway. Recent cuts to interest rates from the Federal Reserve could spark some newfound spending from rejuvenated consumers. In turn, Apple users may choose to upgrade their old iPhones -- leading to a so-called \"supercycle\" event for the company.\n\nMoreover, as Apple continues integrating more features leveraging OpenAI and AI technology into its products, demand for the company's newer hardware could witness a surge.\n\nShould you follow Cohen's moves?\n\nHere's the most important thing to note from Cohen's recent moves: Point72 still owns a lot of Amazon stock. In fact, even after trimming its position, Amazon remains Point72's largest position, comprising about 2% of the total portfolio.\n\nI think Cohen's purchase of Apple stock is a savvy move for a couple of reasons. First, adding Apple to the Point72 portfolio provides additional exposure and diversification among mega cap AI players.\n\nWhile companies such as Amazon have been making moves in the AI realm for some time now, Apple's initiatives have followed a slower pace. For this reason, there's an argument to be made that the AI narrative is less baked into Apple's stock price compared to Amazon's valuation.\n\nMoreover, the iPhone 16 launch and new AI integrations throughout the iOS ecosystem could spark some near-term sales growth, leading to longer-term tailwinds for Apple over time. This could make the timing of Cohen's Apple purchase a particularly smart move.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Cohen is merely hedging his various positions and diversifying his exposure to AI more broadly. Personally, I see both Amazon and Apple as rock-solid choices in a crowded AI landscape. I think Cohen's diversification strategy is a good one to replicate, especially for investors with a long-run time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Breaking down Intel’s wild week",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in its 56-year history. Declining sales, missed opportunities to compete in the AI space, and a massive turnaround effort by CEO Pat Gelsinger looking to return the company to its former glory are putting significant pressure on the chip giant’s bottom line and share price.\n\nAnd things for the company are only getting more interesting.\n\nLast Monday, Intel announced that it signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services, a positive sign for the company’s nascent third-party foundry business.\n\nThen, on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm (QCOM) reached out to Intel about a blockbuster takeover deal that would give Qualcomm a larger foothold in the PC and AI spaces. That’s not all. On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel to keep Gelsinger’s turnaround moving forward. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\nIt’s a lot to follow and even more to make any sense of. Luckily, I’m here to help break it all down for you.\n\nIntel’s slowing sales and AI troubles\n\nIntel is dealing with sliding sales and the unenviable position of having to take on market leader Nvidia in the AI space. For 2023, Intel reported full-year revenue of $54.2 billion, a 14% year-over-year decline from the $63.1 billion the company saw in 2022.\n\nThat included an 8% decline in Intel’s Client Computing Group, which sells chips for PCs; a 20% drop in Data Center and AI revenue; and a 31% decrease in Network and Edge sales. Intel did, however, report a 103% increase in its Intel Foundry Services, but that amounted to just $952 million. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger delivers a speech at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nPart of Intel’s woes have stemmed from the fact that the explosion in PC sales at the onset of the pandemic pulled Client Computing Group revenue forward several quarters, creating a boom and bust. Consumers bought new computers in droves for work and play, sending chip revenue soaring. But millions of consumers don’t usually buy new PCs at the same time. With so many people holding new computers, there were fewer consumers looking for upgrades, and sales entered an extended slump that sent shipments plummeting for eight consecutive quarters.\n\nSales are picking up again, though. In July, IDC said the PC market grew 3% in the second quarter, notching a second consecutive quarter of growth. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\nAt the same time, Intel is facing a new threat from Qualcomm, which began offering its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips in Windows PCs earlier this year as an alternative to Intel’s processors. Those chips provide improved performance and power versus Intel’s older offerings and are meant to compete with Apple’s (AAPL) exceptional M family of chips that power its MacBooks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is fighting back, though. Earlier this month, the company showed off its Core Ultra 200V line of processors that it says can outpace Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nFlagging PC sales also impacted graphics giant Nvidia (NVDA), which saw sales of its video game graphics chips deteriorate after the pandemic boom. But the company, unlike Intel, has managed to exploit its early investments in AI to take advantage of the surge in interest caused by the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThat helped catapult Nvidia to the forefront of the semiconductor industry and sent its stock to extraordinary new heights, rising more than 860% over the last two years and 191% in the last 12 months.\n\nIntel is working to try to catch Nvidia with its own Gaudi line of AI accelerators. On Tuesday, the company debuted its latest Gaudi 3 AI accelerator and announced that IBM will use it as part of its IBM Cloud offering.\n\nBut with Gartner estimating that Nvidia controls more than 70% of AI chip sales, it’s an uphill battle.\n\nIntel’s foundry services\n\nIntel is also battling for position as a chip manufacturer for third-party clients. The plan is for the company’s foundry business to operate as a subsidiary of Intel that builds processors for customers looking for an alternative to TSMC, which is among the world’s largest chipmakers\n\nBut the buildout is costly and Wall Street isn’t completely sold on the idea. Analysts at Citi Research have said Intel should exit the foundry business altogether so that it can improve margins and earnings per share.\n\nIn September, however, Intel announced a multibillion-dollar deal to \"produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced process node.\" The company is also set to build a custom version of its Xeon 6 chip for Amazon.\n\nThe news comes after Intel announced that Microsoft signed on as a manufacturing customer in February. Two big-name companies are certainly a start for Intel, but it’s going to need to sign a slew of customers if it hopes to grow its manufacturing segment to match competing chip fabricators.\n\nQualcomm and Apollo\n\nIntel’s PC and AI woes have left it as a potential takeover target, which is where Qualcomm and Apollo enter the mix. Qualcomm, according to the Wall Street Journal, wants to buy up Intel, though it’s unclear if the company would hold on to all of Intel or sell portions of its business segments. The deal is also sure to generate plenty of antitrust concerns, as the companies are two of the most important chip firms in the US.\n\nApollo, meanwhile, looks to favor Gelsinger’s plans and could invest up to $5 billion in Intel to follow through with the effort, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNow investors will have to wait and see whether Intel moves forward with either company or continues to try to go it alone.

Read them carefully before investing. Interest rate cuts could supercharge the real estate industry. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nVibrant Spending: Consumer E-commerce spending will likely reach a record $240.8 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, Adobe said. This included spending online, discounting, ‘Buy Now, Pay Later,’ mobile shopping and more, it said. The forecast would mean an 8.4% year-over-year increase from the $221.8 billion spent in 2023, which saw a more modest 4.9% growth.\n\nElectronics, apparel and furniture/home goods will account for the bulk of the spending. The firm’s analytics show spending on Black Friday – the Friday that follows the Thanksgiving Thursday, and Thanksgiving day will grow 9.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Cyber Monday online spending is expected to be up a more modest 6.1%.\n\nAdobe expects discounts to peak at 30% this season, and drive over $2 billion in incremental online spending for retailers. The firm also said consumers will likely trade up to more expensive goods this season as opposed to the trend seen in recent months. Expensive goods will likely make up 19% of the share of the total online spending. In electronics, the share will likely be a steeper 58%.\n\nMobile shopping could make up 53.2% of total online spending and spending through BNPL could see another record this time. BNPL sales are expected to rise 11.4% to $18.5 billion, over 75% of this driven by mobile purchases.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest Time To Buy: This time around, discounts would be more spread out, with deals starting in October itself, Adobe said, adding that goods could trade up to 16% off the listed price in October. The discount could go up to 18% in November before the Cyber Week.\n\nHot Sellers: Among the most sought-after items are:\n\nBluey Ultimate Lights Sounds Playhouse​ Slime Kits Sony Group Corp.’s (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 5 Madden NFL 25 Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 ice cream maker Ninja Creami\n\nStock Implications: With most spending likely happening online, those retailers having a strong online presence could be the ones to benefit the most. Pureplay electronics retailers such as Best Buy, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBY), Apple and Sony, e-commerce giant Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and retailers such as Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NYSE:COST) could also be preferred destination for buying consumer electronics goods.\n\nMadden NFL 25 is an American football video game developed by Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) Orlando and published by EA Sports. It could be bought on EA’s website, Amazon, or any other video game retailer.\n\nBNPL stocks such as Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could reap the benefit of rising interest in purchases via the BNPL route.\n\nThe Commerce Department’s retail sales report for August released earlier this month showed an unexpected increase as weak auto & auto parts sales were more than offset by strength in online sales, underlining the underlying strength.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) ended Tuesday’s session up 0.80% at $77.13 but it has lost about 0.8% for the year even as the broader market hovers at a record high.

        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off some impressive upgrades to the company's hit Ray-Ban Meta Glasses during the company's Meta Connect event on Wednesday, including the ability to translate live conversations, offer continuous talking features, and recognize the world around you.\n\nThe updates make the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, which start at $299, a far more intelligent piece of technology — and give them similar features to smartphone-based AI apps like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Circle to Search and Gemini and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming improved Siri and visual intelligence.\n\nAccording to Meta, you'll now be able to do things like ask the glasses to remember where you parked. Or, if you want to know about landmarks in a city you're visiting, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses can tell you more about a statue, building, or location when asked. At the grocery store and want to know what to make for dinner? Meta says the glasses can suggest what you should make based on what you're looking at while walking the aisles. Meta is updating its Ray-Ban Meta Glasses with new AI capabilities. (Meta) (Meta)\n\nThe company also says it's adding real-time translation to the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses. Zuckerberg showed off the feature during a live demo. And while there was a small delay between when a person stopped talking and the glasses began translating, it certainly appeared to work well. In fact, live-translating a conversation with the glasses looks far more natural than doing the same thing while holding up a smartphone.\n\nFinally, Meta showed off a new limited-edition transparent design for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses that lets you see the device's internal components. It gives the glasses a late-90s/early-2000s look that more tech companies should adopt. (Says the guy who grew up during that time.)\n\nIn addition to updates for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, the company also announced its first AI vision models. The new open-source models, called Llama 3.2 11B and 90B, are designed to be able to understand images like charts and graphs.\n\nThe idea is to give developers the ability to create apps using the new models that can, for example, provide a hiker with information about when a particular hike gets steeper by having the AI read over a map of the route.\n\nMeta's AI work has quickly made it one of the top open-source AI companies around. And if it can keep on innovating, it could stand among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Google Challenges Microsoft's Cloud Dominance, Files Antitrust Complaint in Europe: Report\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) with the European Union’s top antitrust regulator Tuesday for allegedly abusing its influence to lock customers into Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure.\n\nGoogle Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery said that Microsoft customers had to pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators.\n\nFor nearly twenty years, Google became a target of EU antitrust action, partly stemming from complaints supported by Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nGoogle has long trailed Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services in the cloud business.\n\nGoogle’s complaint comes after Microsoft’s settlement of a complaint from a trade group representing European cloud services providers.\n\nGoogle argues that Windows Server customers are unfairly penalized if they want to use competing cloud services.\n\nGoogle has also made similar arguments to those of the U.K.’s competition regulator.\n\nEarlier this week, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria noted Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud are gaining traction in cloud and code generation businesses at the cost of Microsoft Azure.\n\nBig Tech companies have been drawing global regulatory scrutiny for their alleged anticompetitive practices, which have boosted their toplines and bottomlines. The companies allegedly created “walled gardens” under their products and services, preventing users from resorting to rival services.\n\nGoogle drew flak for paying companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to keep its search engine as the default for its devices. Apple also drew scrutiny for preventing users from using rival operating systems for its devices.\n\nReports claimed Amazon’s alleged antitrust practices of preferential treatment to its products on its platforms could lead to the company’s breakup. Google also faced similar concerns. However, Wedbush’s Dan Ives snubbed worries over the breakup of Big Techs for alleged violation of antitrust norms.\n\nPrice Actions: MSFT stock is up 0.55% at $431.54 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Which Big Tech Giant Offers The Best Stock Opportunity – AAPL, GOOGL, or MSFT?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are well-known among the big tech giants that have leading roles across various technology sectors beyond semiconductors. I wanted to perform a comparison of these 3 stocks, and I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to assist me in evaluating which of these titans offers the best stock opportunity right now. While I view all three companies as long-term winners and maintain a bullish outlook on each, I believe that Alphabet is currently best positioned for the most significant upside, making it the top stock at this time.\n\nCore Business Overviews for these Three Tech Titans\n\nWhile I maintain a bullish stance on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft for the long term, it’s essential to establish the core differences in their businesses. First, Apple’s strength lies in its hardware, including the iPhone, Mac, and wearables; products which account for over 70% of revenue and reinforce its brand power. Moreover, Apple’s growing services segment (comprising the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay) now contributes nearly 30% of revenue, adding to its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet, the leader in digital advertising, generates the majority of its revenue through Google Search and YouTube, commanding a dominant share of the global search engine market. Furthermore, the company is adding to its investments in cloud computing via Google Cloud, which is growing rapidly but still trails behind industry leaders Azure (Microsoft) and AWS.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft excels in enterprise and cloud computing. Azure is the second-largest cloud platform globally, driving substantial growth for MSFT. Additionally, Microsoft’s software suite, including Windows and Microsoft 365, maintains a strong foothold in the productivity and enterprise space, solidifying the company’s market position.\n\nComparison of Valuation Metrics\n\nDespite trading at premium valuation multiples relative to their industry averages, my positive outlooks on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft remain supported by strong business fundamentals.\n\nApple stock trades at a forward P/E of 33.8x, roughly 40% higher than the technology hardware industry average and 23% above its five-year historical average. Alphabet stock, meanwhile, trades at a forward P/E of 21.2x, almost 60% above the interactive media industry average but about 17% below its GOOGL stock’s own historical average. Microsoft stock trades at a forward P/E of 32.9x, approximately 36% above the system software industry average and just 4.7% above its historical average.\n\nHowever, when factoring in long-term EPS growth estimates over the next 3-5 years, the picture changes. On the basis of PEG (Price to Earnings to Growth ratio), Apple trades at a stretched forward PEG ratio of 3.9x, while Alphabet and Microsoft are more attractively valued with forward PEG ratios of 1.3x and 2.5x, respectively.\n\nAlthough Alphabet has the most de-risked valuation, one could argue that Apple and Microsoft’s diversified business models—dominating hardware, software, and subscription services—offer more stable, recurring revenue despite more limited growth prospects. AAPL stock and MSFT stock are supported by broad revenue bases that reduce reliance on a single income stream. GOOGL stock, meanwhile, carries a heavy dependence on cyclical advertising. That difference may justify Alphabet’s discounted valuation relative to Apple and Microsoft.\n\nCapital Return Programs\n\nAll three companies (Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft) are strong investment holdings due to their robust capital return programs. While their dividend yields of below 1% are modest at best, these companies reward shareholders through substantial share buyback programs.\n\nApple recently authorized a record-breaking $110 billion stock buyback; the largest in corporate history. Over the past twelve months, Apple has repurchased approximately $96.34 billion in common shares, translating to a buyback yield of 2.68% based on a $3.48 trillion market capitalization. Similarly, Alphabet, after announcing its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share this year, unveiled a $70 billion share repurchase program. Over the past twelve months, Alphabet has repurchased $63.3 billion worth of shares, resulting in a buyback yield of 3.2% on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nMicrosoft’s share buyback efforts are a little less competitive, with a newly authorized $60 billion share repurchase program. Over the past twelve months, Microsoft repurchased $17.2 billion in shares, translating to a buyback yield of 0.5% based on its recent $3.21 trillion market capitalization.\n\nAI and Cloud Potential\n\nAs one of the most significant topics in the tech world, the way Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft have approached AI is a key pillar of my bullish outlook for their stocks.\n\nAlphabet has embedded AI and machine learning across its products, from Google Search to YouTube, and is well-positioned to drive growth through Google Cloud. Analysts project 11% revenue growth for Alphabet over the next two fiscal years. Microsoft, meanwhile, has solidified its AI leadership through its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, as well as through Azure’s AI services. Competing closely with AWS for cloud dominance, Microsoft is forecast to grow revenue by 14.6% over two years.\n\nApple’s AI presence is a bit more limited. While the company is rumored to be working on advanced AI projects, possibly integrating AI deeper into Siri and its ecosystem, its AI efforts remain less prominent compared to peers. This may explain Apple’s more modest revenue growth forecast, with analysts predicting only a 2.1% top-line increase over the next two fiscal years.\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nMy bullish views on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft align with the majority of Wall Street analysts. Apple, for example, has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 33 analysts, with 23 rating it a Buy, nine a Hold, and only one a Sell. The average AAPL price target of $248.89 suggests about 10% potential upside.\n\nAlphabet is viewed even more favorably, carrying a Strong Buy rating from 36 analysts, 27 of whom recommend a Buy, while nine recommend a Hold. Its average price target of $201.94 implies a ~25% potential upside.\n\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy rating according to the consensus, with 28 of 30 analysts rating it a Buy, and the remaining two rating it a Hold. The average price target of $501.15 points to more than 15% potential upside.\n\nIn Conclusion, Alphabet Looks Like The Best Name\n\nIn conclusion, while Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all strong long-term investments with dominant positions in their respective sectors, if I had to favor one investment right now it would be GOOGL stock. Alphabet’s strong growth, robust capital returns, and more attractive relative valuation give it a slight edge at this juncture.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta debuts $299 Quest 3S mixed-reality headset",
        "content": "Meta (META) is rolling out a new, less expensive version of its pricey Meta Quest 3 mixed-reality headset. Unveiled during the company's annual Meta Connect event, the Meta Quest 3S offers the same functionality as the Meta Quest 3 with a starting price of $299. Meta is also dropping the price of the Quest 3 from a whopping $649 to $499.\n\nThe Quest 3S sports the same full-color mixed-reality capabilities as the Quest 3, albeit with a narrower field of view and a different overall design. Meta says the Quest 3S also runs on the same Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon XR2 gen. 2 chip found in the Quest 3.\n\nAs the company rolls out the Quest 3S, it's also doing away with its older Quest 2 and pricier Quest Pro headsets.\n\nMeta is positioning the Quest 3S as its entry-level headset for consumers who are just getting into mixed-reality apps and those looking to upgrade from older Quest models. The Quest 3, then, is geared toward consumers who are already mixed-reality fans and are willing to shell out the cash for Meta's top-of-the-line features. Meta debuted its $299 Meta Quest 3S headset. (Image: Meta) (Meta)\n\nMeta says the Quest 3S is compatible with the company's entire library of apps and games and will support upcoming titles like \"Batman: Arkham Shadow.\"\n\nMeta, however, isn't the only name in the headset business. Apple (AAPL) also sells its Vision Pro mixed-reality device, though, at $3,499, it's far more expensive than Meta's offerings. Apple hasn't provided insights into the device's sales performance.\n\nMixed-reality headset sales have faced a tough road as of late. According to IDC, worldwide shipments of augmented and virtual reality headsets fell as much as 28% year over year in the second quarter to 1.1 million units.\n\n\"In recent quarters, mixed reality (MR) headsets took a leap forward in fidelity, first with the launch of the Quest 3 and later the Vision Pro,\" Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, wrote in a release.\n\n\"However, the lack of affordable options has meant that few consumers have experienced this new technology.\"\n\nBut the Meta Quest 3S could start to turn the tide thanks to its relatively low price point. IDC said headset shipments are expected to increase from 6.7 million units in 2024 to 22.9 million in 2028.\n\nWhile that's a solid improvement for the headset business, it's still a far cry from the hundreds of millions of smartphones sold each year. Headsets also have to contend with strong competition from the gaming industry, including from console makers like Nintendo (NTDOY), which is expected to launch its next-generation console in 2025, and Sony (SONY), which is preparing to ship a high-powered version of its PlayStation 5 this fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta is also struggling to make a profit from its vast augmented reality investments. The company recorded a $16 billion loss in the segment for 2023, up from $13.7 billion in 2022, and expects that to increase in 2024.\n\nStill, as the leader in the mixed-reality space, Meta could be the company to truly push the industry forward.

Like many peers, it may also admit that other staple areas of demand such as PCs and smartphones remain in the doldrums.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad NY’s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\n\nThe company is due to report after market close, and analysts expect strong growth related to its high-bandwidth memory chips, used in artificial intelligence data processing. Positive commentary on AI demand could reinvigorate the AI chip trade, which stalled after mixed reports from Broadcom Inc. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nTheir forecasts disappointed demanding investors, similar to the reaction to Micron’s last update three months ago. Revenue growth exceeded 80%, but the outlook underwhelmed a market looking for a bigger boost from AI. After dropping nearly 40% from a June peak and underperforming other chipmakers this year, Micron’s shares now scan as potentially among the biggest bargains in the sector.\n\n“Micron was a victim of high expectations last quarter, but the stock has come down quite a bit since then, which means it could be a beneficiary of low expectations by now,” said Christian Fromhertz, chief executive officer of Tribeca Trade Group. “It will have to say something positive to break above its overhead resistance, but it seems like people think it’s worth a shot at these levels.”\n\nFromhertz said a positive report could take the stock, which last closed at $94, past $100 again, possibly toward its 200-day moving average above $105. However, falling below recent support near $86 would be a bearish signal, he said.\n\nShares rose 1% on Wednesday.\n\nThere are signs of growing bullishness around Micron in the options market. The ratio of Micron put to call open interest is half of what it was a year ago. Near-term bullish positions, especially, dwarf bearish ones, with large holdings in $100 calls expiring two days after earnings, and even larger positions in $95 and $155 calls.\n\nOctober-expiry options are the most bullish since late July, before volatility shocks early the following month hastened a rotation away from tech stocks.\n\nCitigroup Inc. predicts Micron shares will remain weak until pricing trends for DRAM memory chips reverse, something it expects will happen within three to six months. While it has a buy rating — as do more than 90% of analysts overall — analyst Christopher Danely noted the weakness in near-term sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Based on many conversations with investors this week, it appeared roughly 80% were bearish on Micron with every hedge fund we spoke with being bearish but a few mutual funds being bullish.”\n\nThe longer-term picture suggests room for optimism. Based on the average analyst price target, Micron is seen rising more than 50% over the coming 12 months, by far the highest projected return among chipmakers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFurthermore, Micron trades around 10 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest component of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index by this metric. Nvidia, in contrast, trades at above 34. ARM Holdings Plc tops the scale at 81.\n\nSector Catalyst\n\nStill, many investors remain skeptical. While AI is seen as a tailwind for growth, Micron’s other markets — including personal computers and smartphones, where it is a supplier to Apple Inc. — continue to recover from a slump last year. Broadcom’s results also showcased weakness in non-AI businesses. In addition, Micron has faced challenges in increasing production of its new memory chips.\n\nBNP Paribas Exane recently downgraded the stock by two notches, to underperform from outperform, becoming the only firm tracked by Bloomberg to recommend selling the shares.\n\n“While some investors correctly anticipate downside risk to near-term results, we think Micron will underperform AI peers through ’25,” wrote analyst Karl Ackerman, whose $67 price target is the lowest on Wall Street.\n\nThe key question is to what degree any headwinds confronting the company are already reflected in the valuation. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, is optimistic on this front, suggesting Micron’s results could be a sector-wide catalyst.\n\n“The worst is behind it, and the AI theme creates the potential for outperformance over the next several quarters,” Morgan said. “If Micron can confirm there’s something tangible behind the excitement, that will lift the whole AI space. It’s something the market is thirsting for.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for shares of Apple Inc., has been trending lower of late, recently closing at its lowest since June. The index is down more than 45% off a recent peak. Shares of Apple have risen 17% this year.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nGerman software developer SAP SE, product reseller Carahsoft Technology Corp. and other companies are being probed by US officials for potentially conspiring to overcharge government agencies over the course of a decade. OpenAI has pitched the Biden administration on the need for massive data centers that could each use as much power as entire cities, framing the unprecedented expansion as necessary to develop more advanced artificial intelligence models and compete with China. DoorDash Inc., GrubHub Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc.‘s Uber Eats convinced a federal judge to hold unconstitutional a New York City law requiring food delivery apps to share customer data with restaurants. Internet investing firm Prosus NV has fully cut its stake in Chinese online travel agency company Trip.com in a $743 million block trade, according to people familiar with the matter, becoming the latest international investor to exit a Chinese tech company.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nMicron\n\n--With assistance from David Marino and Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to afternoon trading.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "title": "Apple Tax Boon to Go Toward Housing, Energy, Irish Premier Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ireland will dedicate the nearly €14 billion ($15.6 billion) tax bill it’s receiving from a recent Apple Inc. court ruling for housing, energy and water infrastructure, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad NY’s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\n\nHarris said that he will use his upcoming budget plan to outline his plans for the unexpected windfall, which is the equivalent of 14% of government spending this year, or some €2,700 for every man, woman and child.\n\n“There is no doubt housing and housing supply is the most serious economic and social issue in Ireland,” Harris said in a interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. “I think it’s appropriate in our budget that we provide clarity as to the principles we’ll apply, as to how to invest it.”\n\nHarris is days away from delivering a budget proposal that has been boosted by anticipated record corporate tax receipts from the outsize number of multinationals based in Ireland — and that doesn’t even count the Apple windfall. Despite that, the revenue has yet to be meaningfully translated into fixes for Ireland’s major infrastructure challenges, as it faces a chronic housing shortage, water constraints and a stretched electricity grid.\n\n“We need in Europe to not be in any way complacent about our competitiveness,” he said, adding he expects to see an ambitious agenda from the incoming European Commission on that topic. “We have a lot of work to do in relation to that.”\n\nThe Apple windfall, which is the result of an order by the European Union’s top court for Apple to pay the bill, isn’t something the Irish government sought. Indeed, Ireland has always maintained that it didn’t think Apple owed these taxes.\n\nBut the EU’s Court of Justice backed a landmark 2016 decision that Ireland broke state-aid laws by giving the company tax benefits that resulted in an unfair advantage.\n\nThe windfall does give Harris a significant political tool as he faces a March 2025 deadline to call a new election. Speculation has mounted that he could decide to call a snap vote sooner, particularly after he received a bounce in the polls since becoming leader of the Fine Gael party earlier this year.\n\nHarris said in the interview that he isn’t planning an election for November, adding, “It’s more about deciding and arriving at the best and most appropriate time when you can honestly say, ‘This government has done its work, and now is the time to have the election.’”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "title": "Analyst Says Initial Wait Times for Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 are ‘Uninspiring’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)  ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nInvestors are still digesting the Fed’s aggressive rate cut and charting the path forward. Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not “behind the curve” but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns.\n\nAsked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is “resilient” and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960.\n\n“If the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,” Altman said.\n\nWhile the analyst believes currently it’s a “near perfect” overall environment for the market, he did point to “storm clouds” gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia’s war on Ukraine and America’s overall fiscal situation.\n\nFor this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Buzzing AI Stock on Latest News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nWall Street has started to feel that the high expectations they had with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone might not materialize after all.\n\nShipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\n“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. “On average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they’re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon. However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\n\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\n\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

Latest reports suggest that the company has given more people a chance to test a new AI software update that is going to automate features through the virtual assistant Siri. The new update was made available earlier this week and will soon be released to all iPhone owners. The new iPhones, touted as AI-capable, are powered by new chips and software, which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) claims sets them apart from competitor products in the smartphone space. The AI software features are being dubbed Apple Intelligence and concerns have been raised over the soft demands for these phones given the slow rollout of the new AI software.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI news you probably missed.

Based on the average analyst price target, Micron is seen rising more than 50% over the coming 12 months, by far the highest projected return among chipmakers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFurthermore, Micron trades around 10 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest component of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index by this metric. Nvidia, in contrast, trades at above 32. ARM Holdings Plc tops the scale at nearly 80.\n\nSector Catalyst\n\nStill, many investors remain skeptical. While AI is seen as a tailwind for growth, Micron’s other markets — including personal computers and smartphones, where it is a supplier to Apple Inc. — continue to recover from a slump last year. Broadcom’s results also showcased weakness in non-AI businesses. In addition, Micron has faced challenges in increasing production of its new memory chips.\n\nBNP Paribas Exane recently downgraded the stock by two notches, to underperform from outperform, becoming the only firm tracked by Bloomberg to recommend selling the shares.\n\n“While some investors correctly anticipate downside risk to near-term results, we think Micron will underperform AI peers through ’25,” wrote analyst Karl Ackerman, whose $67 price target is the lowest on Wall Street.\n\nThe key question is to what degree any headwinds confronting the company are already reflected in the valuation. Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, is optimistic on this front, suggesting Micron’s results could be a sector-wide catalyst.\n\n“The worst is behind it, and the AI theme creates the potential for outperformance over the next several quarters,” Morgan said. “If Micron can confirm there’s something tangible behind the excitement, that will lift the whole AI space. It’s something the market is thirsting for.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe CBOE Apple VIX, which tracks a market estimate of future volatility for shares of Apple Inc., has been trending lower of late, recently closing at its lowest since June. The index is down more than 45% off a recent peak. Shares of Apple have risen 18% this year.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nGerman software developer SAP SE, product reseller Carahsoft Technology Corp. and other companies are being probed by US officials for potentially conspiring to overcharge government agencies over the course of a decade. OpenAI has pitched the Biden administration on the need for massive data centers that could each use as much power as entire cities, framing the unprecedented expansion as necessary to develop more advanced artificial intelligence models and compete with China. DoorDash Inc., GrubHub Inc., and Uber Technologies Inc.‘s Uber Eats convinced a federal judge to hold unconstitutional a New York City law requiring food delivery apps to share customer data with restaurants. Internet investing firm Prosus NV has fully cut its stake in Chinese online travel agency company Trip.com in a $743 million block trade, according to people familiar with the matter, becoming the latest international investor to exit a Chinese tech company.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nMicron\n\n--With assistance from David Marino and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Threats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

This was the second consecutive quarter that Huawei led this market.\n\nChina significantly outpaced the global wrist-worn device market last quarter with 15.5 million units shipped, a 10.9 per cent year-on-year increase. That growth was on the back of the country's smartwatch shipments of 11.1 million units, which rose 18.7 per cent year on year.\n\nHuawei has \"made substantial progress in regions such as the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, and Central and Eastern Europe\", the IDC report said. \"In addition, Huawei has been leading China's wrist-worn device market since 2021.\"\n\nAfter Huawei, the other top-ranked global wrist-worn device vendors last quarter were Xiaomi, Apple and Samsung Electronics, IDC data show. It pointed out that Apple, which does not have wristband devices, still ranked first in the global smartwatch market.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei Technologies' new titanium-body Watch GT 5 Pro in black and white models.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Bought $345 Million of His Favorite Stock (Hint: Not Apple)",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the most revered investors on Wall Street. That's partly because he has amassed a personal fortune of $140 billion, but also because Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has grown at a phenomenal pace under his leadership.\n\nThe company's Class A stock has returned 20% annually since Buffett took control in 1965. Meanwhile, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has returned about 10% annually. Berkshire's outperformance boils down to prudent capital allocation decisions, and Buffett deserves much of the credit.\n\nHe has architected dozens of savvy acquisitions, made many prudent investments, and repurchased company stock in a manner that has undoubtedly created shareholder value. But two recent capital allocation decisions are worth exploring. In the June quarter, Buffett sold 389 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and he bought $345 million worth of his favorite stock.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire first took a stake in Apple during the first quarter of 2016, and it became the biggest position in the company's portfolio by the fourth quarter of 2017. Many investors were initially surprised because Warren Buffett had famously avoided technology stocks for most of his career. But he has praised Apple CEO Tim Cook for his extraordinary management on several occasions, and Buffett recently said the iPhone \"may be the greatest product of all time.\"\n\nApple still ranks as Berkshire's largest holding, and Buffett does not expect that to change this year. But his decision to sell 49% of the position in the June quarter raises questions, especially because he had already trimmed the position by 13% in the March quarter. Why would Buffett sell so much Apple stock when he clearly admires the company?\n\nEarlier this year, Buffett was asked that question at Berkshire's annual meeting, and he attributed the decision to a probable increase in the corporate tax rate in the future. The U.S. federal government has run a historic deficit in recent years, and Buffett believes higher taxes will be used to remedy the situation at some point. In that scenario, Berkshire would pay more taxes on its earnings, and GAAP earnings include investment gains.\n\nIn other words, Buffett has been selling Apple stock this year so that Berkshire will not have to pay a higher tax rate on the investment gains in the future. That makes sense, but it raises another question: Why focus on Apple? If corporate taxes increase, Berkshire would owe the federal government a large slice of its investment gains on every stock. So, why is Buffett selling Apple so aggressively? The logical answer is valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a wonderful business with enviable brand authority and a strong presence in many markets, including its position as the largest smartphone manufacturer in the U.S. However, Wall Street expects its earnings to increase at 8.6% annually over the next three years, which makes its current valuation of 34.4 times earnings look expensive. Those figure give a PEG ratio of 4, a substantial premium to the three-year average of 2.7.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway amended its stock buyback program in 2018, such that Warren Buffett can repurchase shares whenever he believes they are discounted compared to their intrinsic value. Buffett allocated $345 million to stock buybacks in the June quarter, bringing the total to $2.6 billion year to date and nearly $78 billion since 2018.\n\nConsistent share repurchases indicate Berkshire stock has regularly been undervalued in Buffett's estimation. It also suggests that Berkshire is his favorite stock. As my colleague Sean Williams explains, Buffett could have purchased any of 379 companies in the S&P 500 with $78 billion. Alternatively, he could have bought stock in the other 121 companies. Instead, he spent the money on buybacks.\n\nWhat sets Berkshire apart is the scope of its insurance businesss, coupled with prudent investment decisions made by Buffett and his understudies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. To elaborate, Berkshire is the world leader in insurance float -- a terms that refers to premiums collected by the company that have not yet been paid out in claims. Moreover, Berkshire has paid \"less than nothing\" to accumulate float due to disciplined underwriting, according to Buffett.\n\nHe once defined float as \"funds that do not belong to us, but are nevertheless ours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills.\" That's why Buffett loves the insurance business. With disciplined underwriting, it generates large sums of investable capital, and Buffett has used those funds to create substantial value for shareholders.\n\nBerkshire's book value per share -- a good proxy for changes in intrinsic value -- increased 194% during the 10-year period that ended in the June quarter. The S&P 500 returned 179% over the same interval. That tells me Buffett and his understudies have invested Berkshire's float very effectively.\n\nWall Street expects Berkshire's operating earnings (which exclude investment gains and losses) to increase at 17% annually through 2027. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 23.3 times operating earnings look reasonable. Patient investors should feel confident in buying a small position in Berkshire today, especially because Buffett is probably repurchasing shares in the current quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘Bernstein Said Apple’s Launch Of The iPhone 16 Base and Pro This Year Should Be Relatively Strong Or Normal But Could Be Skewed By The Delayed Rollout Of Apple Intelligence’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\n\nJim Cramer: Tech Companies Flourish Despite Economic Concerns\n\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut—believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\n\nBut how about the tech economy, the one based out here where we are right now? When you're talking to companies in Silicon Valley, it almost feels like the people who run these companies are like inmates who escaped from the asylum of interest rates years ago. What they do is exploit opportunities that allow them to become integral to the enterprise. They don't really care about the consumer; they're selling to businesses that then sell to you. So their total addressable market doesn't hinge on interest rates; it hinges on how innovative they are. That's a story you've heard from all the companies we've interviewed. These are companies about innovation.\"\n\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic—things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\n\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness—a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\n\nRising Stars: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Boosts Profits Even as Sales Slow\n\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer reported that Bernstein believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s launch of the iPhone 16, both the base and Pro models, will be “relatively strong” this year. However, the rollout could be affected by delays in Apple Intelligence, the new system that will incorporate generative AI. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi maintained an \"outperform\" rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and set a price target of $240.\n\n\"Bernstein said Apple ’s launch of the iPhone 16 base and Pro this year should be “relatively strong/normal” but could be skewed by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence, the system that will use generative AI. Analyst Toni Sacconaghi kept his outperform rating and a price target of $240.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s strong outlook is backed by impressive Q2 2024 earnings, with total revenue of $95 billion, an 11% increase from last year, and a net income of about $23 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth is largely driven by robust iPhone sales, which rose 15% thanks to new model releases and upgrades. The iPhone remains central to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s revenue, with high demand for the iPhone 15 series due to its appealing features for both new and existing customers.\n\nIn addition, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s services segment, which includes iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, grew by 20%, reflecting successful ecosystem expansion and higher profit margins. Wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods are also becoming popular, driven by increased consumer interest in health and fitness.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s planned entry into augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets with a new headset is expected to create new revenue opportunities and strengthen its presence in emerging technologies. Strong brand loyalty and an integrated ecosystem help retain users and encourage repeat purchases. Recent product launches and sustainability efforts, such as aiming for carbon neutrality in its supply chain by 2030, further attract environmentally conscious consumers.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "UK stocks that have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index",
        "content": "UK stocks have been unloved for some time with investors favouring the likes of the US, but data shows there are a number of British companies that have delivered market-beating returns over the past decade.\n\n“The US market has acted like a magnet in recent years and pulled investors away from the UK with the lure of fast-growth technology companies,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), are part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks that account for a third of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) market value.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft's (MSFT) market capitalisation of $3.2tn (£2.4tn) is bigger than that of the entire FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which stands at £2.1tn, according to the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAs such, these companies have helped drive US market returns, with the S&P 500 up 32% over one year and 91% over five years.\n\nHowever, Coatsworth said: \"A gloomier US economic outlook and rich equity valuations that side of the Atlantic suggests it might be time to add a stronger British flavour to an ISA or pension as the London market is full of stocks on attractive valuations\".\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced a bigger-than-expected 50 basis point interest rate cut last week, its first in four years, signalling to some on Wall Street that the central bank was playing catch up. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank didn't think it was \"behind\" on cutting rates but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did say in its commentary alongside the rate decision that the \"economic outlook is uncertain\".\n\nLooking at the UK market, the FTSE All-Share (^FTAS) — which is made up of the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 (^FTMC) and FTSE SmallCap (^FTSC) indices and totals 561 companies — has generated a 12% over one year and 33% over five years, according to data provided by AJ Bell.\n\nWhile the UK market more broadly hasn't quite managed to match US performance, Coatsworth said that \"clever stock pickers could have easily smashed\" the FTSE All-Share's returns. He pointed out that just under half of the stocks in the FTSE 350 — comprised of the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 — have \"trounced\" their records.\n\n“One third of these UK market-beating stocks haven’t simply had a lucky year,\" he said. Analysis by AJ Bell showed 51 individual companies in the FTSE 350 index had beaten the broader UK market in each of the past one, five and 10 years.\n\nMarket-beating UK stocks Bakery chain Greggs is a 'well-oiled machine that’s created a recipe for success', according to AJ Bell analyst Dan Coatsworth. (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nFood-on-the-go retailer Greggs, is up 32% over one-year and 69% over five years.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Greggs is a well-oiled machine that’s created a recipe for success,\" said Coatsworth.\n\nHe said that not only does it sells food and drink at an affordable price and in an efficient manner but it also continues to \"innovate and launch new products, keeping existing customers interested and enticing new ones into its stores\".\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\n\"Greggs is earning more from existing stores by having them open for longer, while at the same time it continues to open new sites,\" Coatsworth said. \"Behind the scenes, it is reinvesting cash flow into manufacturing, distribution and logistics to support its growth.\"\n\nIn its interim results released in July, Greggs posted nearly a 14% increase in sales for the period to £961m and a 16% rise in underlying pre-tax profit to £74m.\n\nTesco (TSCO.L)\n\nSupermarket chain Tesco's stock rose 38% over the last year and 54% over five years.\n\n“Despite operating in a competitive market, Tesco has held onto the top spot in the UK grocery sector thanks to hard work and determination,\" said Coatsworth. \"Discounters Aldi and Lidl have kept Tesco on its toes and ensured it has never been complacent.\"\n\nRead more: London closes gap on New York as top global financial centre\n\nThe supermarket's use of data via transactions using its Clubcard loyalty scheme allows it to gain insights into shoppers tastes and tailor promotions or push products accordingly.\n\nFirst-quarter results in June, showed sales in the UK and the Republic of Ireland were up nearly 4% like-for-like to £14.3bn.\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\nMr Kipling-maker Premier Foods saw shares climb 51% over one year and 470% over five years.\n\nCoatsworth said the company was once a \"zombie\" company due to its debt pile but it has since resolved this issue, enabling it to reap the \"benefits of investment in the business to make it more competitive and innovative\".\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\n\"Shoppers continue to fill their baskets each week with its brands including Oxo, Bisto, Mr Kipling, Homepride and Paxo,\" he said. \"Trends come and go, but these brands are true classics and that gives Premier Foods a big advantage over its rivals.”\n\nPremier Foods' first-quarter results showed group sales of branded products were up 7% on the previous year to nearly £214m.\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nShares in Bloomsbury Publishing have surged 78% over the past year and 203% over five years.\n\nCoatsworth said that the company is \"proof that the public still loves a book, despite it feeling as if everyone is always staring at their phones\".\n\nBloomsbury has benefitted from publishing the likes of the Harry Potter franchise and Sarah J Maas' big titles, showing it is a \"dab hand at spotting talent\".\n\n\"It is good at making money from new and old titles, reworking books via new editions and capturing new generations of readers,\" said Coatsworth. \"It has also done well in the education market, diversifying revenue streams and making the business less reliant on a handful of authors.”\n\nBack in May, the publisher reported that it had achieved its highest revenue and profit in its 37-year history for the year ended 29 February. The company recorded 30% revenue growth at £343m.\n\nBAE Systems (BA.L)\n\nDefence company BAE Systems has been another strong performer on the UK market, with shares up 28% over one year and 142% over five years.\n\n“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made governments around the world sit up and think more seriously about defence capabilities,\" said Coatsworth.\n\n\"That has led to greater spending across the defence spectrum, creating a tailwind for companies like BAE Systems,\" which produces defence, aerospace and security solutions.\n\n\"Greater cybersecurity spending has also been a tailwind for the UK defence champion as it has the strength to flex both its physical and digital muscles.\"\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nBAE Systems posted 13% growth in first-half sales last month, at £13.4bn, along with a 13% increase in underlying earnings before interest and tax, at £1.4bn.\n\nCoatsworth said that these star performers on the London market demonstrated that investors \"don’t have to choose between the US and UK markets as having a blend of both would help to spread risks.\"\n\nHe said: \"History suggests a portfolio where all the components don’t move in unison can provide a lower-risk experience for investors. Having certain things go up when others are going down means the investor isn’t risking all of their money on one area.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "TikTok will shut down its music streaming service beginning Nov. 28, just two years after parent company ByteDance aimed to compete with the likes of Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music (AAPL).\n\nThe company is encouraging its users to utilize the “Add To Music App” feature, which lets users save the songs they discover on TikTok to the music streaming services of their choice. Users were told to transfer playlists to other services no later than Oct. 28.\n\n\"We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry,\" Ole Obermann, global head of music business development at TikTok, said in a statement.\n\nThe move represents a shift in strategy for the company, which now no longer wants to compete with third party streaming services. Rather, it wants to continue to partner with them.\n\nSpotify shares ticked higher in early trading following the news, up more than 1%.\n\nByteDance first initiated talks with music labels to expand the music streaming service, originally dubbed Resso, in 2022. At the time, the goal was to utilize TikTok's ability to discover new music and make songs go viral.\n\nThe new platform, which signed licensing deals with major record labels including Sony Music Entertainment (SONY), Warner Music Group (WMG) and Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), launched in July 2023 with a new name: TikTok Music. It was initially rolled out in Indonesia and Brazil before quickly entering markets including Australia, Mexico and Singapore.\n\nBut the company has recently found itself in hot water with those labels over a variety of issues, from appropriate compensation for artists and songwriters to protections from artificial intelligence.\n\nEarlier this year, TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) faced a months-long dispute that eliminated the songs of top artists, including Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, among others, from the platform.\n\nThe dispute was eventually resolved in May with the two sides signing an updated agreement that addressed some of the concerns.\n\nTikTok is currently at the center of a bipartisan political battle after President Biden signed new legislation that will ban the app in the US unless ByteDance divests its ownership stake.\n\nAfter filing a lawsuit to block the new legislation, TikTok argued its case in front of a federal appeals court last week. But if that fails, a ban could come as early as January 2025.\n\nStory continues ARCHIVE - TikTok will shut down its music streaming service beginning Nov. 28 (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, Archive) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Roku Remains ‘Very Committed’ to Set-Top Boxes Even as Smart TVs Spread",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Roku Inc. said the company remains “very committed” to its namesake set-top boxes, even as the electronics industry shifts to smart televisions with built-in streaming technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad Eric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nMustafa Ozgen, president of devices at the company, said he sees a “ton of opportunities” for the technology, describing the category as a long-term play. Ozgen made the remarks as the company unveiled a faster version of its $99 Roku Ultra box with an upgraded remote control.\n\nRoku built its brand around set-top boxes — devices that plug into existing TVs and add the company’s interface and apps — but the industry has shifted to TVs that run the software directly. Roku itself has been part of this transition: The company sells its own TVs, and its technology is integrated into other models.\n\nOzgen acknowledged that TVs are now “slightly higher” unit sellers than the external devices, known as players. But the latter category is still a “particularly strong seller” in the US, he said.\n\nRoku generated $491 million last year from devices — including TVs and players — but does not break out specific numbers for each category. The company’s biggest revenue driver is its platform and programming content, which generated almost $3 billion in 2023.\n\nOzgen said Roku players are still important for people with older TVs who want to add a newer experience, and they outsell competitors’ devices. Still, the company’s content business, which includes revenue sharing from streaming services and advertising sales, is its real moneymaker.\n\nThe devices’ segment has a negative gross margin, contributing to losses at the San Jose, California-based company. A disappointing financial outlook pummeled Roku’s stock in February, though the shares have begun to rebound in recent months. They remain down 19% in 2024.\n\nThe new Roku Ultra player adds the Wi-Fi 6 standard for better connectivity, an upgrade over Wi-Fi 5. Ozgen said that other improvements are coming to its players in the future, though support for 8K resolution is still “several years away,” given the limited amount of programming available. And while some users have begun watching TV in virtual reality, Ozgen said Roku has no current plans to get into that space.\n\nCompetitors are making their own moves. In August, Alphabet Inc.’s Google introduced a new TV Streamer, a revamped set-top box built around AI. Apple Inc., meanwhile, hasn’t updated its device since 2022, when it cut the price and added a faster processor. But Apple recently updated the software on its box, adding improvements to FaceTime and other features.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Threats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Stock That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuable company in the world right now with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. But a closer look at the company's recent financial performance indicates that it is finding it difficult to put its growth into a higher gear.\n\nFor instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29), Apple's revenue increased just 5% year over year to $85.8 billion. Analysts are expecting this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to finish the year with a 9% increase in revenue to $390 billion. Additionally, its revenue is expected to increase by just 8% in the next fiscal year.\n\nThis lukewarm growth at Apple can be attributed to the company's already massive revenue base. Moreover, Apple's bread-and-butter end market of smartphones is already quite huge, and its growth has stagnated. Market research firm IDC estimates that the global smartphone market could reach an annual growth rate of just 2.3% through 2028.\n\nConsidering that Apple is reliant on the iPhone for 52% of its revenue, it is not surprising to see that it's not expected to grow at a blistering pace anymore. This is precisely the reason Apple could lose its crown as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a company that is sitting on lucrative and fast-growing end markets that could help it deliver impressive growth over the next decade.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why Nvidia could be worth more than Apple after a decade.\n\nNvidia is set to benefit from massive growth opportunities in multiple end markets\n\nNvidia is currently the third-most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $2.85 trillion, which means that it is not very far from catching Apple. The terrific pace at which Nvidia has been growing tells us that it can indeed catch the iPhone maker over the next decade.\n\nThe company, which is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), reported phenomenal revenue growth of 122% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to $30 billion. Nvidia has been riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave, with its chips being deployed for training popular AI models such as ChatGPT. And now, Nvidia is diversifying into areas beyond AI training so that it can sustain its handsome growth for a long time to come.\n\nFor instance, on its August earnings conference call, Nvidia management pointed out that AI inference applications have accounted for more than 40% of its data center revenue. This is an important trend to note as inference is the process of using a trained AI model to generate results from a fresh set of data. So, Nvidia has moved beyond AI training and is now getting a nice chunk of revenue from the AI inferencing space as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's good news for the company's long-term prospects as its presence in both these markets should allow it to remain a dominant force in AI chips. Investors should note that the market for AI chips is expected to generate $300 billion in revenue in 2034, growing at an annual rate of 22% over the next decade.\n\nNvidia reportedly controls 70% to 95% of the AI chip market, according various estimates, leaving very little for rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. It won't be surprising to see that trend continue over the next decade as well, as a result of which Nvidia could sustain its elevated levels of growth for a long time to come.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is diversifying into lucrative markets such as AI enterprise software, where it has started witnessing impressive growth. This could unlock another lucrative growth opportunity for the company as the AI software market is expected to generate a whopping $1 trillion in revenue by 2032, according to Precedence Research.\n\nThen again, Nvidia has other solid growth drivers in the form of the nascent but potentially massive cloud gaming space where it has already established a solid position for itself. All this explains why the company is forecast to grow at a much faster pace than Apple.\n\nFaster growth could help the chipmaker overtake Apple's market cap\n\nAnalysts are expecting Apple's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% over the next five years. There is a chance that the iPhone maker's earnings growth could accelerate in the long run thanks to the growing contribution of the company's high-margin services business, but it is likely to be hamstrung by the slow pace of growth in smartphone sales over the next decade.\n\nPrecedence Research estimates that the global smartphone market could see 7% annual growth through 2034. While that's rosier than IDC's forecast, Precedence believes that the adoption of technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality are likely to help the smartphone market achieve faster growth. But it is worth noting that these technologies have been around for some time and they haven't been enough to inject life into the smartphone market.\n\nOn the other hand, the advent of AI turned out to be a massive catalyst for Nvidia. Analysts are forecasting the company's earnings to increase at a CAGR of 52% over the next five years, a much faster pace than what Apple is expected to report. Moreover, Nvidia's end markets are set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple's, and the good part is that the company is the dominant player in most of those markets.\n\nSo, there is a good chance that Nvidia could outperform Apple's growth by a big margin over the next decade, and the market could reward the former with more upside as a result and help it become a more valuable company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple's Mammoth $700 Billion Investment Since 2013 Can't Fix Its Biggest Problem",
        "content": "For much of the past decade, tech goliathApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has sat atop Wall Street's pedestal as its largest and most-influential business. It became the first public company to reach a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018, and was the first to top $3 trillion in June 2023.\n\nWhile a key investment that's the envy of pretty much every other public company has played a vital role in its ascent, this mammoth investment isn't able to fix what's currently Apple's biggest problem. Image source: Apple.\n\nApple's $700 billion investment has been a godsend for its shareholders\n\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett made Apple his company's top holding for a good reason. Namely, its veritable sea of catalysts and competitive advantages.\n\nFor instance, it's one of the world's strongest and most easily recognized brands. Kantar's annual \"BrandZ Most Valuable Global Brands Report\" for 2024 listed Apple as the top brand for a third consecutive year. It was the only company to receive a brand value north of $1 trillion, and was commended for having products that justify a premium price.\n\nApple's iPhone is also unmistakably dominant in the U.S. Since introducing a 5G-capable version of the iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, it's maintained a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market and has seen its share of global shipments surge from 12% in 2020 to 16% by 2023. There's historically been plenty of excitement surrounding Apple's annual iPhone update/reveal.\n\nInvestors buy Apple stock for its innovative capacity, too, which includes innovations that extend beyond the physical products that initially endeared the company to consumers. CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a multiyear endeavor that has his company focused on growing its Services segment. Subscription services should bolster the company's operating margin over the long run, keep customers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services, and minimize the revenue ebbs-and-flows associated with iPhone replacement cycles.\n\nBut the unmistakable investment that's played the biggest role in Apple's success is the roughly $700 billion it's apportioned to share repurchases since the start of 2013. Here's a breakdown of Apple's buyback activity over the last 11 years:\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion Through nine months of fiscal 2024: $69.866 billion\n\nStory continues\n\nCollectively, Apple has repurchased $700.61 billion worth of its common stock since the beginning of 2013 and has reduced its outstanding share count by 42.24% since peaking.\n\nAside from incrementally increasing the ownership stake of shareholders and promoting a long-term mindset, buying back stock is having a positive impact on earnings per share (EPS). Businesses with steady or growing net income and a declining share count tend to enjoy an EPS boost, which ultimately makes their stock more fundamentally attractive to value-focused investors, like Warren Buffett.\n\nIf Apple hadn't spent a cent on share repurchases over the last 11 years, its trailing-12-month EPS, which is currently north of $6.50, would be just $3.87. These buybacks have been that vital to the success of its stock.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple's $700 billion investment can't fix its biggest problem. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's growth engine has stalled -- and that's a big problem\n\nWhile buying back copious amounts of stock has, at times, helped Apple maintain some semblance of value in the eye of investors, the company's growth engine has completely stalled out over the last few years. This is a massive problem that buybacks simply won't fix.\n\nDespite record Services revenue in the fiscal third quarter (ended June 29) and double-digit sales growth from this segment through the first nine months of the current fiscal year, Apple's physical product segments are struggling.\n\niPhone, which is Apple's top segment by revenue (52.3% of net sales), has endured a sales slump of roughly 1% from the comparable period last year. Consumers haven't been impressed with the lack of major changes Apple has made to its newest models, and they continue to wait on artificial intelligence (AI) to be incorporated into next-gen iPhone models. Though Mac sales are up about 2% year-over-year, they fell by a double-digit percentage last year. The return to the office for working Americans following the COVID-19 pandemic has put a serious damper on demand for personal computers/laptops. Sales of iPad are down nearly 10% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to $19.7 billion. Apple's Wearables, Home and Accessories segment, which includes Apple Watch, has navigated a greater-than 8% sales slump, thus far, in fiscal 2024.\n\nEven with Services now accounting for 24% of net sales and growing by double digits, Apple's revenue is up by (drum roll) just 1% from the comparable period last year. AAPL Net Income (Annual) Chart\n\nAlthough Services will lead to a higher operating margin over time, it alone hasn't been packing enough punch to meaningfully grow Apple's net income. Here's a breakdown of Apple's net income through the first nine months of its last four fiscal years:\n\nThrough Q3 2021: $74.129 billion Through Q3 2022: $79.082 billion Through Q3 2023: $74.039 billion Through Q3 2024: $79 billion (on the nose)\n\nApple's net income has gone nowhere in two years and is up by just 6.6% over the last three years. However, this operating weakness has been well-masked by the company's ramped-up buyback program. All the while, Apple's stock has gained 61% since the end of its fiscal third quarter in 2022, despite a nominal decline in its net income.\n\nWhat makes this lack of growth even more egregious is that it occurred during a period of historically high inflation in the U.S. A record-breaking increase in U.S. money supply sent the prevailing rate of inflation soaring at a pace not witnessed since the early 1980s. Even with an exceptionally strong brand and pricing power in its sails, Apple's revenue and profit growth have completely stalled.\n\nThis is a particularly big problem for Apple because it's currently valued at 31 times forecast earnings for the upcoming year. This represents a 17% premium to its average forward-year price-to-earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nIn other words, Apple is historically pricey at a time when its operating performance is misfiring. No amount of share repurchases fixes this.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Friday was supposed to be a good day for the shares of Apple Inc., with the iPhone maker set to be a big winner from the quarterly adjustment of major stock indexes. And for most of the session, that’s how it played out — until about 10 minutes before the closing bell.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads AOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nBy the time it rang, Apple had sunk more than 2% from its intraday high to close in the red, a surprise reversal that has left market watchers guessing who or what could have triggered it.\n\nMarket-on-close orders — those instructing a broker to buy or sell a stock at the closing price of a trading day — showed an unusually large imbalance at the time, indicating net disposals of 30 million shares. That’s more than half of Apple’s average full-day volume in the prior three months, all offloaded in the dying minutes of the Wall Street week.\n\nThe huge selling pressure was a surprise because funds tracking major equity benchmarks were expected to be big buyers of the stock on Friday after Warren Buffett sold a significant stake in Apple during the second quarter. That meant the company’s weighting was due to be significantly increased in many gauges.\n\nOne theory is that some actively managed funds may have capitalized on this predictable liquidity to trim their holdings.\n\n“Maybe some investors wanted to take advantage of the rebalance to sell a sizable chunk of stock,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “They knew that a big piece of buying power was about to hit the market, so they knew it would be a great time for them to sell a chunk of stock without knocking down the stock very much.”\n\nWhile Apple closed Friday down 0.3%, it was still 2.6% higher for the week overall. The shares slipped as much as 1% on Monday before paring the loss by half as of 12:45 p.m. in New York.\n\nAnother possibility is that arbitrage players may have snapped up Apple shares in advance of the rebalance event, which Piper Sandler & Co. estimated was set to create $35 billion of demand from passive funds. The stock rose for three straight sessions before Friday, jumping almost 6% in that time.\n\nWhile it’s getting crowded, buying stocks whose representations in major indexes are rising and selling those with falling influence has been a reliable strategy for many in the hedge fund world.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Arbitragers try to preposition themselves ahead of various index events because they think there is going to be movement at the close during rebalance days,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. “Although it is getting tougher to do, it still does happen.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Threats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Designer Jony Ive, who gave many of Apple’s most iconic products their distinct look, is working with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to design and build an AI product. And the company’s funding raise could reach $1 billion before the end of the year.\n\nThe project was confirmed in a feature about Ive that appears in The New York Times but did not give details about what, exactly, the project is. Industrial designer Marc Newson, who is working with Ive on the project, indicated the teams are still determining exactly what the project will be.\n\nThat’s not stopping investors from jumping in. The project could reach unicorn status before the end of December, with investors including Emerson Collective, which is run by Laurene Powell Jobs. Ive’s LoveDesign will be in charge of designing the product.\n\nIve and Altman first met last year, when Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, arranged a dinner between the two. Ive and Altman discussed how generative AI could make new computing devices possible, among other things. That led to more dinners and eventually an agreement to work together. In February, the startup found offices and hired 10 employees, including the person who succeeded Ive at Apple as well as the product development lead for the iPhone.\n\nIve left Apple in 2019 to start his own company. It has turned some heads with its creations thus far, including a new typeface and a new sort of button on coats, but to date LoveDesign has not played a part in any significant hardware designs, something that has baffled some onlookers, given Ive’s storied history in that field.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Talking to CNBC in a latest program, Belsk said the “resiliency” of this bull market is “undoubted.”\n\nThe analyst said that the stock market is going higher through the end of this year.\n\n“We do believe that the Fed is doing a great job. We believe the Fed that we are not hitting into a recession. We believe the Fed that we are heading into more of a soft landing,” the analyst said.\n\nBelsk thinks we are in the “1995-1996 environment” where we can “handle” the 24x earnings multiple.\n\nThe analyst added that the Mag. 7 stocks underperformed the market in the third quarter and yet the broader market grew, which shows the market rally is broad.\n\nFor this article we chose 10 AI stocks trending on the back of latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Buzzing AI Stock Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJoanna Stern, Wall Street Journal personal technology columnist, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, said that while there is “some good” in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence, the software is still in beta and it’s still early to say anything concrete about it. She said that Apple Intelligence’s writing and summary tools were strong but its image editing tool was “not the best.”\n\nStern said that practically speaking, the new iPhone is an S model because its hardware does not show a significant bump. She also thinks AI would not be a huge motivator for people to upgrade to the new iPhone.\n\n“I do not think that many people are running out to buy these phones for AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Institutional investors are Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) biggest bettors and were rewarded after last week's US$181b market cap gain",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Apple's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 40% ownership Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nLast week’s 5.5% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 30%.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Apple.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Apple?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Apple. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Apple's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Apple. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 3.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Apple\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that Apple Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$2.1b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 37% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Apple. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Apple .\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has recently seen its shares trade off from $193 to $158, representing a more than an 18% drop, as investors have arguably been discounting both competitive and regulatory pressures the company is currently facing.\n\nWe think this recent decline is largely exaggerated and that the stock is starting to get cheap again, both fundamentally and relative to industry peers. In addition, we also think investors may be discounting and overlooking the Google parent's moat relative to other big tech players, which are trading at significantly higher valuations. Finally, we look at the risks to our thesis and what investors should be aware of when looking at the stock. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nGoogle's moat is underrated\n\nOne thing we think is often overlooked when analyzing Alphabet is the qualitative aspect of how much moat the company actually has. While it is easy to judge Apple's iPhone moat and ecosystem, Google has done a pretty good job of being a stronghold for consumers in multiple domains, with some services seen as very essential.\n\nIn fact, we believe consumers would find it difficult to see a world without Alphabet's ecosystem, which ranges from Gmail, Android, Google Cloud, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, Google Maps and Google News, to name a few. In addition, after all these years, we think the company has created a very strong brand loyalty among its users, most of whom choose Google Chrome as their default web browser even when presented with another choice.\n\nEarlier this year, in March, new rules went into effect in the European Union, allowing users to choose which default browser to use, but this did not seem to have a substantial impact on Google's market share, which is another sign of its strong brand loyalty. We believe that even if Google is ordered to stop making payments to other companies, such as $20 billion to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for using Google Search as the default Web browser, it probably would not hurt Alphabet as much as it would hurt the other companies in question.\n\nIn general, just the data advantage Alphabet currently has over competitors, as well as the perceived accuracy advantage they seemingly have with Google Search, seems to be a dealbreaker for many users. Regardless, Google Search remains Alphabet's bread and butter, with the segment accounting for more than 57% of total revenue. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nAnother reason we think the company's moat is undervalued is the fact some of Google's business units, such as YouTube, could be worth more than publicly traded top-tier competitors. For example, YouTube ads alone pulled in $7.67 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter, compared with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which earned $9.56 billion in revenue last quarter. YouTube, on the other hand, has 2.7 billion active users versus Netflix, which has 277.65 million active subscribers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, we think YouTube is just at the beginning of monetizing its user base with YouTube Premium. In general, it would be quite conservative to give YouTube a rating similar to Netflix's, even though the number of minutes watched annually on YouTube is significantly higher than Netflix. Netflix, on the other hand, is currently trading with a market cap of $292 billion. And while many pointed out that YouTube's revenue this quarter fell short of expectations by $8.67 billion, or 13.02% year over year, revenue from Google Subscriptions, which includes the strong growth of YouTube Premium, rose 14.37% year over year to $9.31 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also gaining momentum, with operating income up $395 million to $1.17 billion, while margins increased from 9.40% last quarter to 11.30% this quarter. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nValuation headed for cheap territory\n\nOne of the most attractive features of Alphabet among big tech players, more specifically the Magnificent Seven, is the fact it is the cheapest of them all at certain valuations. On an enterprise value/Ebit basis, for example, the stock trades at only a ratio of 18.37, compared to other Magnificent Seven companies that typically trade at a multiple of at least 20 to 35 times. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nOverall, also looking at forward-looking estimates, Alphabet is trading at a mere 15.82 times 2026 forward price-earnings, against an expected $10.01 earnings per share. Moreover, the company has a massive $100.73 billion buffer of cash on its balance sheet. However, we noticed quite a difference between the figures in the income statement and free cash flow.\n\nFor example, if we look at operating income on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow usually follows operating income pretty closely. In this case, we looked at free cash flow net of stock-based compensation. As you can see, as of the third quarter of 2023, adjusted free cash flow is significantly lower than normal compared to operating income. This difference is mainly due to higher investments due to spending on hardware for AI infrastructure, as well as changes in accounting from 2023, extending the life of their servers and hardware from four to five years to six years. With respect to the significant investments in AI infrastructure, it also remains to be seen whether this will translate into future flows of free cash flow. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nAnother key benefit for Alphabet investors is the fact it has used almost all of its free cash flow and sometimes some of its cash reserves to return capital to investors in the form of share repurchases. On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has repurchased $63.36 billion worth of shares while generating $60.79 billion in free cash flow. Outside of innovation in AI models, Alphabet is still going strong with initiatives such as Waymo, expanding its autonomous car fleet and recently partnering with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to integrate with existing Uber customers.\n\nThe bearish thesis\n\nHowever, there are risks to our bullish thesis as there are some macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds to keep in mind. First, in terms of legislative risks, Google is under scrutiny from several angles, both in the EU and in the United States, mainly regarding antitrust issues. In the United States, a judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, with the current lawsuit, with the plaintiff's request to have the company at least sell Google Ad Manager, ongoing, according to a report.\n\nIn the EU, the company just lost its appeal against a $2.42 billion fine over its comparison shopping service. Alphabet is also fighting two other fines around Google's practices with Android and the Google AdSense platform. The way we see these issues is that most of these rulings are likely to take several years to resolve, especially if it appeals. Moreover, by the time there is a ruling, Google may have enough competition from AI, for example with OpenAI's SearchGPT over ads. The company should also be able to easily pay these fines with the huge amounts of free cash flow it generates, as highlighted earlier.\n\nThe biggest problems we believe Alphabet may face in the short to medium term are at the macroeconomic level. First, the yield curve, more specifically the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields, is back in positive territory after being deeply inverted for about two years, which is a strong indicator that a recession is likely near. The Sahm Rule, which indicates the change in unemployment, also recently crossed the 0.50 threshold and currently stands at 0.57. At 0.57, a recession is usually imminent. Previous times when this value reached 0.57, there was always a recession. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nWhile many investors will view the recent announcement of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve positively, we want to remind people that interest rate cuts are reactive and not preventive. Usually, when interest rates are cut, unemployment has already risen dramatically and the United States is already in recession, with stock indexes down significantly. In addition, we would also be wary of insider trading in recent years with Alphabet, given that there have been almost no insider purchases and quite a few insider sales by management and directors.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn conclusion, we think Alphabet is getting cheap on both a fundamental, historical and relative basis, with the stock likely trading at a discount to other big tech companies due to what we see as overblown competitive and regulatory pressures. We also think investors are discounting or overlooking Google's moat in several areas.\n\nIn reality, Alphabet is not just another search engine, but a company that has a huge data advantage over its competitors and is able to provide a far superior service, as evidenced by the fact it did not lose material market share in the EU following a decision to let consumers decide which browser to use. The main downside that we think investors should consider at this time is on the macroeconomic front, where we think a recession is very near and could negatively impact Alphabet in the short to medium term. Finally, we would also pay attention to the widening gap between free cash flow and operating income in upcoming earnings reports.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman is teaming up with former Apple (AAPL) design executive Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, to start a new artificial intelligence device company.\n\nIve confirmed the project Tin in an interview with the New York Timespublished Saturday. According to the former Apple executive, it all started when Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky — a close friend of Altman’s and client of Ive’s design company, LoveFrom — arranged for the pair to meet for dinner last year.\n\nFrom there, Altman and Ive continued to meet, and decided that they would build a new device, with Ive responsible for the design. Ive and Emerson Collective, a firm founded by Powell Jobs, have already contributed, according to the Times. By the end of this year, the startup could reach $1 billion in funding.\n\nThe secret project already has a physical office space and 10 employees. Key staffers include Tang Tan, who headed product design teams for the iPhone and Apple Watch, and Evans Hankey, who succeeded Ive as Apple’s design chief.\n\nIve left Apple in July 2019 after nearly three decades with the iPhone maker, and founded his own design studio, LoveFrom, shortly after.\n\nThe Information first reported talks between Altman and Ive over an AI hardware project a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Altman’s OpenAI, the company behind popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, is in talks with several investors to raise billions of dollars in new funding, which would value the company at more than $100 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe funding round is reportedly drawing big names, including Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — which is in talks to potentially contribute $100 million. The latter owns a 49% share of OpenAI’s profits after contributing approximately $13 billion to startup, including $10 billion in backing in January 2023.\n\nOver the past two years, OpenAI has become the most influential generative AI company on the market. ChatGPT hit 100 million weekly users earlier this year, and kicked off the genAI and chatbot boom with the success of its flagship model.\n\nWith that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball. A deal allowing employees to sell stakes in the company valued OpenAI at $86 billion late last year, nearly triple what it was earlier in 2023.With that growth, OpenAI’s influence — and value — has continued to snowball.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's best stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer observes that many on Wall Street enjoy going against the crowd, which is why some analysts downplay the significance of a half-point rate cut. He disagrees, asserting that common sense often gets overlooked by those who think they know better.\n\n\"Everybody on Wall Street loves to be a contrarian, which is why so many commentators keep trying to minimize the impact of a half-point rate cut. Not me! No matter what, common sense dictates that there are always people who think they know better than common sense, and they don’t. There are so few advantages to age, I have to tell you.\"\n\nMarket Roars Back: Bears Get Played as Dow Surges 522 Points Amid Rate Cut Frenzy!\n\nJim Cramer points out the irony that, despite critics spreading negativity, the stock market soared today, with the Dow jumping 522 points, the S&P rising 1.7%, and the NASDAQ climbing 2.5%. He found it remarkable. Initially, bearish sentiment swayed the markets right after the announcement yesterday, causing many to panic and sell, particularly in tech stocks, which often face unwarranted hits from rate cuts.\n\nCritics fueled this panic, echoing a negative narrative without questioning it, which led to a rush for the exits. Cramer emphasizes that this reaction to a rate cut, rather than a hike, creates a misleading panic, demonstrating how easily people can be misled into thinking a 50 basis point easing is bad news, which he believes is simply foolish.\n\n\"Funny thing: while these critics were polluting your minds, the stock market exploded today, with the Dow gaining 522 points, the S&P surging 1.7%, and the NASDAQ pole vaulting 2.5%. I’ve got to tell you, it was a thing of beauty. The Bears initially had their way with the markets, distorting a view immediately after the announcement at 2 p.m. yesterday. They fooled enough people to start blowing out of stocks in their frenzy, especially tech stocks, as if those are the ones that always get hit on a rate cut.\n\nThat’s just not true. There were also people who panicked, thinking the Fed was panicking. Commentator after commentator came on air, echoing this negative narrative out of nowhere. After all, who wants to go against the tide and question why sellers are streaming for the exits? You don’t want to be in the way of that. That’s how the aftermath of a rate cut—not a hike, but a cut—snowballs into a giant avalanche of people who have been instantly brainwashed into thinking that a 50 basis point easing is somehow bad news. That’s what we saw yesterday after 2:00. That analysis was absurd, just pure foolishness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n50 Basis Point Cut Boosts Stocks and Housing\n\nJim Cramer notes that during a period of rate cuts, the potential winners are diverse and promising, while the losers are clear and should be avoided. He highlights that once the Wall Street Journal announced the possibility of a 50 basis point cut, the range of stocks that could benefit significantly widened. A smaller 25 basis point cut would have helped homebuilders if they increased construction, but they’ve been hesitant due to still-high rates. However, a 50 basis point cut will lead to lower mortgage rates, making homes more affordable and likely boosting the housing market.\n\n\"The winners in an easing cycle are varied and exciting, while the losers are obvious and must be avoided. From the moment the Journal reported that there could be a 50 basis point cut, the swatch of what can go higher expanded dogmatically. A 25-point cut would have been truly beneficial for homebuilders if they would just start building a lot more homes, that's something they've been reluctant to do because rates are still too high. But a 50 basis point cut means lower mortgages for certain and, therefore, more affordable homes.\"\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn this article, we review the latest episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money where he discussed several stocks. We have ranked the companies according to their popularity among hedge funds, starting with the least owned and progressing to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer remains a staunch advocate for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), suggesting that investors should hold the stock for the long term rather than engage in frequent trading. This recommendation is further solidified by recent comments from T-Mobile (\n\nNASDAQ:TMUS)'s CEO, who confirmed strong sales of the new iPhone model. Contrary to the bearish sentiment expressed by some analysts, the CEO indicated that sales have exceeded expectations, even surpassing those of the previous year.\n\n\"A Cramer favorite: Apple. I always say to own it, don’t trade it, and I’m even more adamant about that position after what we heard from T-Mobile's CEO yesterday. Contrary to what the bears have been telling you, he says sales of the new iPhone are going great.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to demonstrate exceptional financial performance, with Q2 2024 revenue reaching approximately $94 billion. This significant year-over-year growth, driven by robust iPhone sales and the company's expanding services segment, solidifies Apple's position as a global technology leader.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s diverse ecosystem, which includes hardware, software, and services, continues to thrive. The services segment—covering Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, iCloud, and the App Store—shows consistent growth and significantly contributes to overall revenue. Upcoming product launches, such as the iPhone 15 and advancements in AR/VR technology, are expected to maintain consumer interest and boost future sales, reinforcing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s commitment to innovation.\n\nAdditionally, strong brand loyalty fosters recurring revenue as customers tend to stick with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s products, enhancing customer lifetime value. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also expanding into emerging markets and increasing its focus on health technology, potentially creating new revenue streams.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's best stocks to buy after Fed rate cut. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - China's Xiaomi has asked India's antitrust body to recall its report that found the company and Walmart's Flipkart breached competition laws, arguing it contains commercial secrets, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nAny recall of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) report could delay its antitrust investigation, which began in 2021. In a rare move in August, the commission recalled an antitrust report on Apple after the company similarly complained commercial secrets were disclosed.\n\nXiaomi has told the commission in an application the investigation report on Flipkart contains sensitive business data on the smartphone company which was supposed to be redacted when the document was shared with parties in the case, said the two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nOne of Xiaomi's concerns with the Flipkart report is that it contains its model-wise sales which is sensitive information, one of the sources said.\n\nXiaomi, Flipkart and the competition watchdog did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.\n\nThe commission does not make investigation reports public and they are only shared with parties to the case. A recall requires parties to return the report which then undergoes further review for redactions.\n\nThe watchdog has found that e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart gave preference to select sellers and prioritised certain listings, and also colluded with companies like Xiaomi to launch phones exclusively on their websites, Reuters reported this month citing the August reports on Flipkart and Amazon.\n\nCounterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.\n\nXiaomi is not concerned with data in the report made on Amazon, in which the investigators also said the two companies colluded on online sales in breach of antitrust laws, said both the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is confidential.\n\nIt wants the commission to ask parties to return the report and destroy any copies, allowing the watchdog to further redact the sensitive information and reshare the reports, said the first source.\n\nThe watchdog took a similar step with its Apple report, which found the U.S. company exploited its dominant position in the market for app stores on its iOS operating system. The company denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe commission's Flipkart report said the Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Lenovo and Realme indulged in the practice of exclusive product launches on Flipkart's shopping website, saying this was \"against free and fair competition\" and \"against the interest of consumers\".\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "New Apple Inc. (AAPL) Event Planned for October to Unveil AI-Enhanced Macs",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design​. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets – over 20% – to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Just a few weeks after launching the new iPhone with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features heavily marketed by the tech giant, a new Apple event is likely to take place in October that would unveil the newest versions of the MacBook Pro, iMac, and the Mac Mini. The new computers would also come pre-loaded with Apple Intelligence and are expected to rival AI workloads of PCs announced by Apple rival Microsoft in the last few months. Apple had debuted Apple Intelligence back in June, the first step of the tech giant into the world of generative AI.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a $273 price target. In an investor note, the advisory noted that Apple iPhone 16 lead times were improving but were still tracking lower year-over-year. However, lead times as a proxy for demand this early had little predictive power, contended the analysts at Morgan Stanley, who argued that the trajectory of lead times in the next 10 days was more important. First two-week lead times were directionally predictive of next 12 month shipments at the model level, but not for December quarter iPhone build revisions or total iPhone shipments, added the analysts.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Fed's preferred inflation gauge and second quarter GDP: What to know this week",
        "content": "The rate cut that everyone was waiting for finally arrived. Markets offered a resoundingly positive response to the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign. But the euphoria was only fleeting. Friday's trading brought fresh concerns over corporate earnings and economic growth.\n\nStocks, however, still posted overall wins for the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week up about 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 1.5%. While Friday brought down the S&P, the index notched an all-time high earlier in the week and the Dow closed with a record.\n\nThe biggest question for investors this upcoming week is whether a new batch of data supports Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assertion that the US economy remains strong.  A second quarter GDP reading due Thursday will help test that contention.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell was also careful not to declare a victory over inflation as pricing pressures continue to come down. Friday's scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will offer another progress report on that front.\n\nQuarterly earnings reports from Costco (COST), Micron (MU), and Accenture (ACN) are also on deck.\n\nWhat's next for the Fed?\n\nThe quiet period is over and so is the tightening. The public is set to receive fresh commentary from Fed officials in the days after the momentous shift away from a restrictive monetary policy. Perhaps the biggest question for policymakers is, where do we go from here?\n\nAt least eight central bank officials, including Powell, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr, and New York Fed chief John Williams, are scheduled to offer speeches or participate in conferences in the days ahead, likely giving color to the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Fed members see two more 25 basis point cuts this year, followed by four more in 2025.\n\nPowell has said the central bank was not playing catch-up in opting for a larger rate cut, addressing criticism that the Fed should have eased rates at their last policy huddle in July. He's also stated that cuts of 50 basis points shouldn't be thought of as the new norm. But a greater slowdown in the labor market could challenge both of his contentions.\n\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThe new risks and the old\n\nInflation was so high and the job market so tight that curbing price increases was the Fed's sole focus over the last two years. But now that inflation is cooling and the job market showing signs of slowing, the Fed has to advance its mandate on both fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday Powell noted the upside risks to inflation have diminished while the downside risks to employment have increased. \"We know it is time to recalibrate our policy,\" he said, confirming that the balance of risks is \"now even.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Friday's PCE reading to come in at 2.3% year over year, down from the prior month's 2.5% annual increase, according to Bloomberg data. Such a favorable metric would continue a downward climb and affirm the Fed's decision making.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut even as more eyes are on the labor market, the Fed still hasn't met its inflation goal of 2%. And as central bankers have reiterated, stepping off the brakes too early could allow heightened inflation to pick back up.\n\nAs Bank of America Global Research analysts put it in a note on Friday, \"With above-potential growth, a strong consumer, and a record-breaking stock market, such a bold start to an easing cycle is hard to justify if a recession isn't imminent.\"\n\n\"Unless the Fed is seeing something that we are missing, a more aggressive easing cycle could make reaching the 2% target harder considering uncertainty ahead, including the aftermath of US elections,\" they wrote.\n\nTech stock reset\n\nTech investors have been on the hunt for their next catalyst, and the Fed may have just handed it to them. After a mixed earnings season where Wall Street largely soured on massive AI spending and flashed impatience for less-than-perfect quarters, the rate-sensitive sector could revert back to growth mode.\n\nAll but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks posted gains last week, with Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) all outpacing the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA), the sole loser, shed more than 2% last week as it grapples with volatility after a stunning spring and summer rise. Still, some analysts see a more nuanced picture. As Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned, the upside of even the most high-flying tech stocks is limited as the ability to match their prior growth becomes more difficult.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Posts 24% Return Over 12 Months Amid Rising Hedge Fund Investment",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Innovative Stocks that Pay Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other best innovative stocks that pay dividends.\n\nInnovation plays a crucial role in today’s market. With the significant attention tech stocks have gained over the past year, it’s clear where investors are directing their funds. Tech firms are leveraging disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence to process vast, complex datasets. In the healthcare sector, advancements in research and development (R&D) have led to life-saving drug therapies and treatments. Meanwhile, the growing impact of climate change is pushing energy and utility companies to prioritize renewable energy sources. Therefore, innovation lies at the heart of every industry today.\n\nBusinesses in the US and globally swiftly recognized the influence of innovation on their growth and operations, and they are gradually shaping their activities around it. A recent McKinsey survey of over 1,000 executives revealed that companies with a strong culture of innovation are twice as successful as some of their peers in scaling digital transformations. These innovative firms focus on technologies and changes to their operating models that promote rapid learning and adaptation—essential components of innovation. The report also highlighted that 14 of the top 20 global companies have leveraged innovation to either expand existing markets or create entirely new ones.\n\nRead also: Top 18 Automotive Industry Innovations and Trends\n\nA key component of innovation is R&D, which focuses on systematic and scientific investigation to create new products, technologies, or processes. Through R&D investments, companies can strengthen their abilities, explore fresh ideas, and discover innovative solutions to address customer demands. Businesses worldwide, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, have boosted their R&D investments to develop new products that meet the demands of their customers. Financial Times reported that R&D in the US has grown in recent decades, increasing from 2.2% of GDP in the 1980s to 3.4% in 2021. This rise is mainly due to the private sector’s contribution, which doubled to 2.5% of GDP. Moreover, the percentage of the population involved in patent creation almost doubled during this time.\n\nIt’s not just established companies that are embracing innovation in their operations; the rise of US startups also reflects this trend, as they introduce groundbreaking business ideas previously unheard of. Economist John Haltiwanger found that Americans were starting new businesses at an unprecedented rate. And he’s not mistaken. In 2020, more new businesses were launched than in any previous year, with 2021 following closely behind. According to the Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship, the one-year survival rate for these startups exceeded 80% in 2021, marking the highest rate since 1999. Haltiwanger noted that a surge in new businesses is a strong indicator of job creation, innovation, and productivity growth within the economy. He further said that startup booms not only reflect technological innovation but also significantly drive it. Startups explore how to leverage new technologies, experiment with them, and create new products, pushing competitors to adapt and innovate in response. Research from Texas McCombs, which examined 6,116 patents from the mid-1970s to 2016, highlighted the impact of startups on innovation. The study found that patents from startups were cited 8.5% more each year and 21% more over a nine-year period compared to patents from established companies.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024 and picked companies that actively prioritize and promote the development of new and groundbreaking ideas, products, services, or business processes. From that list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked them in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment towards them. These companies belong to different sectors, including healthcare, technology, aerospace, and defense.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has played a key role in creating revolutionary devices and services that have transformed the consumer electronics market, including the iPhone, iPad, iTunes, and the App Store, among others. The stock has surged by nearly 19% since the start of 2024 and in the past 12 months, it has delivered a 24% return. The company is delivering strong returns this year, even with some fluctuations in iPhone sales. In fiscal Q3 2024, it reported a 14.5% quarter-over-quarter decrease in iPhone sales, totaling over $39.2 billion.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue for the quarter came in at $85.8 billion, which grew by 5% from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company also unveiled significant updates to its software platforms at the Worldwide Developers Conference. This included Apple Intelligence, a groundbreaking personal intelligence system that integrates advanced, private generative AI models into the core of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Baron Funds highlighted the strengths in the company’s business in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say about AAPL:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nBeing a dividend payer, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a strong cash position. In the most recent quarter, the company reported an operating cash flow of $29 billion. It returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company holds a 12-year streak of consistent dividend growth, which makes it one of the best innovative stocks that pay dividends. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.45%, as of September 18.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a popular stock among elite funds during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database. The hedge fund positions in the company jumped to 184 in Q2, from 150 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of more than $124 billion.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best innovative stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization of almost $3.3 trillion. The popularity of the company's iPhones played a central role in helping the tech giant reach this position. So it was not surprising to see Apple stock drop in price after TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo pointed out that the demand for the company's latest iPhones is not as strong as expected.\n\nKuo estimates that pre-orders of Apple's latest iPhone 16 models are down nearly 13% year over year, with the first weekend's sales estimated to come in at 37 million units. Apple touted this latest model as a significant change over previous iPhones because it's the first to be artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled. But some doubters wonder if it was introduced too late. Samsung leads the generative AI smartphone market with a share of 36%, according to industry estimates, while Chinese manufacturers Xiaomi and Huawei control 22% and 13% share of this market, respectively.\n\nKuo's report of lower pre-orders offers potential evidence that the doubters are right and it's a cause for concern. However, a closer look at the reasons behind the reportedly poor start of the iPhone 16 lineup indicates that investors shouldn't panic. It won't be surprising to see Apple's AI-enabled iPhones gradually gain sales momentum and help the stock deliver healthy gains over the next three years.\n\nApple investors need to be patient\n\nThe generative AI smartphone is in its early phases of growth, which is why investors shouldn't start panicking based on just one weekend of sales data of Apple's latest iPhones. According to market research firm IDC, shipments of generative AI smartphones are expected to hit 234 million units in 2024, an increase of a whopping 364% from last year.\n\nEven then, generative AI smartphones are forecast to account for 19% of the global smartphone market this year, suggesting that their sales could keep growing at a tremendous pace in the coming years. IDC predicts that the generative AI smartphone market could clock a compound annual growth rate of 78% between 2024 and 2028, with shipments hitting 912 million units at the end of the forecast period. So it isn't too late for Apple yet to make a dent in the generative AI smartphone market and witness an acceleration in growth in the future.\n\nAnother reason why the new iPhones are likely to get off to a slow start is that they won't be running Apple Intelligence right out of the box. Apple's suite of generative AI features will be first made available in U.S. English by way of a software update next month. Other English-speaking countries such as the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa will join the list in December, while other languages such as French, Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese are likely to get Apple Intelligence next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, it is not surprising to see why customers may not be rushing to purchase the latest iPhone models at launch. However, the long-term opportunity for the company within the generative AI smartphone market remains intact, especially considering a sizable installed base of users in an upgrade window.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, there are 50 million iPhone 12 models that are currently in an upgrade window in the U.S. alone. Meanwhile, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush estimates that around 300 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over four years. So, Apple could be sitting on a massive upgrade cycle that could help drive sales of the iPhone 16 and subsequent AI-enabled models.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to look at the bigger picture instead of relying on one week of sales data. This is also the reason why analysts expect Apple's growth to accelerate over the next couple of fiscal years. AAPL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nApple is expected to generate just over $390 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year, which would be an improvement of less than 2% from its top line in fiscal 2023. However, the estimate for fiscal 2025, which will begin next month, suggests that the company's revenue is on track to increase by almost 8%. The estimate for fiscal 2026 suggests that Apple is on track to maintain its revenue growth momentum.\n\nStronger earnings growth could send the stock higher over the next three years\n\nThe improvement in Apple's top line is set to filter down to its bottom line as well. The company reported $6.13 per share in earnings in fiscal 2023, and the chart shows that its bottom line is on track to improve by 9% in fiscal 2024. However, the growth rate is set to improve over the next couple of years. AAPL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAssuming Apple's earnings indeed jump to $8.39 per share after three years, and it trades at 33 times earnings at that time (in line with its current earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $277. That would be a 28% increase from current levels.\n\nHowever, Apple stock could deliver stronger gains if the market decides to reward the company's AI-powered growth with a richer earnings multiple, especially considering that it is currently trading at a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average earnings multiple of 44.\n\nSo, Apple investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees, as the generative AI smartphone has a lot of room for growth, and the company already has a huge installed base of users that should help it start capitalizing on this lucrative opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Fed Delivers Large Rate Cut In Bid To Sustain Labor Market; Stocks, Gold Set New Record highs: This Week In The Markets\n\nIn its September meeting, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points, lowering the target range to 4.75%-5%. This bold move defied most economists’ predictions, who had anticipated a more modest 25-basis-point reduction.\n\nThe Fed also hinted at the potential for additional cuts in the coming months, with the updated dot plot revealing a more aggressive rate-cutting trajectory than forecasted in June.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the labor market as a key focus, stressing the importance of acting preemptively to sustain robust employment. “The time to support the labor market is when it's strong, not when you begin to see layoffs,” Powell unequivocally said.\n\nHowever, Powell also called for caution, framing the rate cut as part of a “recalibration” rather than a signal of a broader policy shift. He reiterated that future decisions would remain data-dependent, underscoring the Fed's flexibility in responding to economic conditions.\n\nWall Street analysts reacted by adjusting their rate cut forecasts more aggressively, reflecting expectations of a looser policy trajectory ahead.\n\nBoth gold prices and major U.S. stock indices, including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones, surged to record highs following the Fed’s decision.\n\nFed Fuels Growth\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Benzinga, a Lazard’s small-cap expert highlights the Federal Reserve’s shift to a pro-growth stance, which is expected to boost Russell 2000's performance. This policy pivot could create favorable conditions for investors in smaller companies, which trade relatively cheaper compared to large-cap counterparts.\n\nMortgage Demand Rises\n\nMortgage rates fell to near 6% last week, spurring a surge in demand for both refinancing and home purchases. As homeowners and buyers capitalize on these lower rates, market activity in the real estate sector is picking up momentum, with increased interest in locking in favorable mortgage terms.\n\niPhone Demand Lags\n\nEarly pre-order data for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone 16 suggests weaker-than-expected demand, raising concerns about the device’s market performance. However, some analysts believe Apple could still exceed expectations with potential surprises in upcoming earnings reports.\n\nGM Expands Charging\n\nGeneral Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) has enhanced electric vehicle charging access, opening 17,800 Tesla chargers to all GM drivers. This move broadens charging options for GM’s EV customers, potentially boosting EV adoption and aligning with the company’s electrification goals.\n\nRead now:\n\nPalantir, Dell To Join S&P 500 Friday: Here’s How Tesla Stock Has Performed Since Its Addition In 2020\n\nStory continues\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Former Snap design engineer on new AR glasses: 'Obviously bad'",
        "content": "One of Snap’s (SNAP) own former employees thinks its augmented reality glasses are \"bad.\"\n\nSterling Crispin, an engineer who worked on designing the glasses in the past, slammed the product in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, this week.\n\n“I worked on these for about a year at Snap, and I have a million negative things to say about the experience and the device,” Crispin wrote of Snap’s AR Spectacles, “but I think the product speaks for itself and is obviously bad.”\n\nSnap did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance’s request for comment.\n\n“I don’t want to get into the specifics because I might inadvertently break an NDA and would probably hurt some people’s feelings who worked on it, but it’s really a disaster,” Crispin continued.\n\nCrispin was laid off from Snap in 2022, according to a LinkedIn post he shared at the time.\n\nSnap's newest AR Spectacles represent a bid to expand in a struggling market. Meta (META) has lost nearly $50 billion in the more than four years its Reality Labs division has spent developing its AR and VR products. Apple’s (AAPL) attempt to best the market with its uber-expensive Vision Pro headsets has disappointed consumers and investors alike. Not to mention the failures of Google Glass (GOOG) and Microsoft’s HoloLens (MSFT), among others. A participant at the Snap Partner Summit event tries out the new generation of Snapchat glasses, \"Spectacles.\" (Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped Meta, Apple, and now Snap from trying. Meta and Ray Ban-parent EssilorLuxottica (ESLOY) recently expanded their partnership as they continue to work on creating AI-enabled Ray Ban smart glasses. Apple opened up Vision Pro sales abroad this summer, and the product was heavily highlighted during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June. And Google, Qualcomm (QCOM), and Samsung (005930.KS) are reportedly working on smart glasses too.\n\nSnap isn’t exactly new to the space. The company first launched its Spectacles in 2016 and added augmented reality features to the glasses in 2021, though those features were only available to about 200 creators. Its fifth-generation Spectacles debuted this week — this time as an AR product for a wider audience. The product will be available as part of the company’s developer kit for $99 a month.\n\n“Spectacles are the result of a decade of research and development to introduce hardware that breaks the bounds of screens and brings people together in the real world,” the company said in its announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe glasses have gotten mostly positive feedback. MIT Tech Review said the Spectacles “could finally deliver on the promises devices like Magic Leap, or HoloLens, or even Google Glass, made many years ago.” A CNET review said, “Snap is getting a foot in the door a little ahead of competitors.” The Verge said Snap is getting closer to creating “compelling AR.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThose glowing reviews are a good sign for the social platform as it looks to emerge from two years of financial hardship. Snap's stock has fallen nearly 37% over the past three months and its current $10 share price is far below highs in the $70 range in 2021. The company has yet to turn a profit since launching over a decade ago. Shares of Snap edged down 0.55% in Friday trading.\n\nSnap’s CEO has insisted that the company is turning things around. Indeed, the company’s loss shrunk 34% in the second quarter ended Aug. 1 compared to 2023. Its revenue grew 16% year over year to $1.2 billion but fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The platform’s new feature, “Simple Snapchat,” also launched this week as part of its efforts to attract more users and improve monetization.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is set to be hit by another attack from European Union watchdogs, paving the way for a hefty fine and an order to change its business model unless the US giant takes rapid action to give more prominence to rivals across its sprawling search empire.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nEU officials are preparing a formal chargesheet against the Alphabet Inc. unit under the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, targeting how the company displays rival product results across its different search services, such as Google Flights and Google Hotels. The company could face hefty penalties of up to 10% of global annual revenue if its fails to step into line with the rules.\n\nThe EU’s preliminary findings could be issued before the end of October, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke under condition of anonymity. The people added that the timing could slip with the upcoming changeover of top level officials at the European Commission, and Google still has some time to offset the EU authority’s concerns. A final decision in the case is due to come before the end of March next year.\n\nGoogle’s lawyers met with EU commission officials behind closed doors this week in a bid to ease the watchdog’s concerns over compliance with the rules. One proposal floated by the firm includes introducing a new design into Google’s search tabs, that would give users the option of navigating to alternative search platforms or direct suppliers such as hotel websites and airlines, according to other people familiar with the matter.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the firm has tried to balance the needs of different types of websites, while still respecting users’ choice. The commission in Brussels declined to comment.\n\nThe EU’s landmark DMA lays out a series of dos and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms. The upcoming warning comes on the heels of a major court win for the commission against abusive behavior on Google Search. Last week, the Mountain View, California company lost its court bid to topple a once-record €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) fine over EU allegations that it had abused its monopoly power to crush rival shopping services. This week, the company had better success, managing to overturn a €1.5 billion EU fine for thwarting competition for online ads, in a dispute over behavior that the firm says finished in 2016.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shopping case was one of four that have marked the centerpiece of EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager’s efforts to crack down on the growing power of big tech companies. She’s fined Google more than €8 billion to date and has also echoed the US Department of Justice’s suggestion that Google’s advertising technology business should be broken up. Vestager is coming to the end of her decade-long stint at the EU and is soon to be replaced by Spain’s Teresa Ribera.\n\nGoogle is set to join Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. in facing formal DMA complaints. The bloc first hit out at Apple’s app stores rules in June, and then issued a warning about Meta’s subscription model for ad-free services on Instagram and Facebook. Just this week, Apple was pressed to make changes to its iPhone operating system in order to step into line with the rules.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

There’s a new camera button, improved camera performance, bigger screens on the Pro models, and better battery life all around.\n\nI’ve spent some time using both the iPhone 16, starting at $799, and the iPhone 16 Pro, starting at $999. If you’re coming from an outdated iPhone, you’ll appreciate the new phones’ refinements. But the biggest upgrade to Apple’s newest iPhones is the company’s Apple Intelligence platform.\n\nAvailable as a software update in October — no, it’s not launching alongside the phones — Apple Intelligence will bring a series of AI-powered features to the iPhone including a smarter Siri, AI-based writing tools for summarizing and rewriting your messages to fit a specific tone, and the option to summarize your notifications so you don’t have to read through 57 unrelated texts to find out what time you and your friends are getting dinner tonight.\n\nTo use Apple Intelligence, however, you’ll need to have either an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, or iPhone 16 Pro. If you’ve got an iPhone 15, you’re out of luck. Apple says the base 15 simply isn’t powerful enough to run the Apple Intelligence software. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro.

And while it’s too early to say whether that’s true or not, after using a beta version of the software, I can say its new capabilities are certainly welcome additions to the iPhone.\n\nI can’t say Apple Intelligence is the kind of thing that’s worth upgrading your iPhone for just yet, but taken as a whole, the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro lines provide the right kind of improvements that make them solid updates.\n\nCamera Control and new cameras\n\nLet’s talk about what’s new to the iPhone 16 lineup. First is the new Camera Control button. A new way to launch and, well, control the camera, the Camera Control button is found on the lower right side of both iPhone 16s and iPhone 16 Pros.\n\nPress the button and you’ll instantly launch the iPhone’s Camera app. Gently double-press the button and it’ll pull up the app’s camera exposure, depth, zoom, cameras, styles, and tone options. Lightly tap the button again to dive deeper into each setting. Sure, you can already launch the camera app by swiping right or tapping the camera button from the iPhone’s lock screen, but Camera Control makes it feel like you’re using an old-school point-and-shoot camera. Man, referring to it like that makes me feel old.\n\nStory continues The Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 Pro. (howley)\n\nStill, it’s true. Being able to take photos and shoot videos by pressing or pressing and holding the Camera Control button does make capturing your subjects as easy as using an old, dedicated camera. You don’t have to move your finger around the screen to change the zoom level or adjust the exposure, losing your framing and risking dropping your iPhone. Is it the sole reason to upgrade? No, but it’s a helpful addition to the iPhone.\n\nOn the camera front, Apple’s new styles feature allows you to adjust the look of your shot from stark black and white to luminous, adjusting various sections of the photo rather than simply blanketing it with a filter. The result is a camera option that genuinely makes your shots look far more interesting and lively than they otherwise would. It’s an excellent enhancement to the camera app, and one you’ll want to try out as soon as you get the chance.\n\nApple has also added a new Audio Mix editing mode for your videos that is meant to improve the voice of the person in your shot versus the ambient sound around you. There’s a standard mode that leaves all of the audio levels the same, an in-frame option that focuses more on the subject in the shot and reduces the background levels, as well as studio and cinematic modes.\n\nIt’s downright impressive how much of a difference the modes make to your video, and swapping between each while editing your piece lets you see which is better for your project. If you’re in a crowded place and want to get a video of your friends and family, the in-frame mode is the choice for you. And because you adjust the audio style while editing rather than while shooting your video, you don’t have to worry that you recorded it in the wrong mode and risk ruining your video when you take it. The iPhone 16 Pro gets new, improved cameras. (howley)\n\nAll four iPhones also get new cameras. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now feature 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras that can capture macro photography images and provide better low-light shots. Apple also says the phones offer the equivalent of a 2x optical zoom thanks to their 48-megapixel Fusion cameras.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro now comes with a 5x telephoto camera to make the 5x camera on the Pro Max, and both Pro phones get new 48-megapixel Fusion cameras and 48-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. All of that works out to some incremental changes for the iPhones' cameras. Overall, the ability to take macro photos using the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus and the addition of 5x telephoto zoom to the iPhone 16 Pro are the best upgrades of the lot.\n\nIn the future, Apple will also add a feature called visual intelligence to the iPhone that will allow users to point their phones' cameras at real-world objects and get information on them. One example Apple has offered is snapping a shot of a restaurant and quickly getting its hours and user reviews. But that won’t land until later this year.\n\nDisplays and performance\n\nIn addition to updated cameras, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max get new larger displays. The iPhone 16 Pro’s screen goes from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches, while the Pro Max’s goes from 6.7 to 6.9 inches. Apple did this by slightly increasing the size of the phones and slimming down their bezels, making them look more like a single piece of glass up front. The Action Button is now available on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. (howley)\n\nIt’s not an enormous increase in screen size, but when you’re streaming movies or scrolling Reddit, any extra space is an improvement. Apple’s always-on display also makes a comeback on the Pro and Pro Max, but it’s still not available on the 16 or 16 Plus, which is a bummer.\n\nApple did, however, bring the Action Button over to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Previously only available on the Pros, the Action Button is a customizable button on the left side of the iPhone that you can set to do things like launch the voice recorder, magnifier, or, my favorite, the flashlight.\n\nIn terms of power, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus get Apple’s new A18 chip, while the Pro and Pro Max get the A18 Pro processor. You won’t run into any slowdown with either chip whether you’re playing games or just browsing TikTok or Instagram, and they’re both designed to run Apple Intelligence.\n\nAs for battery life, I got through my entire work day with the iPhone 16, then streamed the Mets game, and the battery still had a 19% charge at about 10:30 at night. As for the Pro, I used it for email and Slack, perusing social media apps, and ordering from Dunkin, and still had 71% battery life after about 7 hours of use. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro bring speedier chips, bigger screens, and the new Camera Control button. (howley)\n\nShould you get it?\n\nThe latest iPhones bring speedier chips, larger displays on the Pros, improved cameras, and a new camera button. If, however, you just bought an iPhone 15 or 15 Pro or even have an iPhone 14, you can still hold off.\n\nI can’t say whether Apple Intelligence is worth upgrading to a new phone because it’s not ready for prime time yet. And since it’s still in beta, Apple could change or add or remove features before it releases the software.\n\nAll other things considered, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro are what you’d expect from Apple. Great phones that are incrementally better than their predecessors. We’ll have to wait until Apple Intelligence comes out to know if it pushes the phones beyond that.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘QUALCOMM  Incorporated (QCOM) Is About To Lose Modem Revenue’ According to Analysts",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Don’t Miss Out: Jim Cramer’s 10 Key Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against Jim Cramer's other key stocks to watch.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce, to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what’s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There’s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That’s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\"\n\nUnlocking Profit Potential with Lower Rates and AI\n\nJim Cramer stated that today's market movements show it's possible to navigate unpredictable conditions. He emphasized that we don't need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to decrease, which is essential for maintaining a bull market. He advised against overthinking the situation and suggested focusing on profitable opportunities, particularly the growing importance of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don’t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that’s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I’d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that while AI is generating excitement in the stock market, its impact on the broader economy has been limited. There are some practical applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. This is why many analysts are starting to label the hype around AI as a bubble.\n\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We’ve heard so much about this technology and how it’s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn’t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings—nothing flashy. That’s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI, especially when combined with advanced computing from chipmakers, significantly speeds up processes and enables machines to act intelligently, similar to capable humans. He noted that businesses aim to create quality products for consumers, but a shortage of workers has become a major issue, particularly highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This has led to sales associates being too busy to engage effectively with customers, resulting in rushed and confusing interactions.\n\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Business wants to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes—that’s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\n\nThat became apparent during COVID. We can’t interact effectively because our sales associates are too busy to be anything but brisk or confused. They’re harried from the moment they come in to the moment they leave. It’s a late-stage capitalist directive. What can I say? What doctor has time to talk to you? What nurse practitioner can give you the time of day?\"\n\nTransforming Customer Service with Superior AI Agents\n\nCramer pointed out that companies are pushing their employees hard to boost profits, which can create a stressful environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, he recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage with customers politely, and efficiently answering common questions by using personalized data.\n\nCramer argued that AI is an ideal solution for customer service, as it can provide clear and friendly assistance without the frustrations that often come from human employees who are overwhelmed and eager to leave. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries on their own.\n\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond your data. It knows your preferences.\n\nThis is the perfect way to handle customer interactions instead of relying on humans who can be unclear, impatient, or exhausted. Humans are, well, human, harried and ready to go home. But machines infused with AI are delightful, smart, and engaging. They don’t mind going to work, and that’s where these AI agents come in. The machines can listen, reason, and either direct you to the right place or handle everything themselves.\"\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI offers a better experience than what we currently have. For instance, in retail, AI knows customer preferences, helps with returns, and suggests alternatives based on previous purchases, reducing the need to deal with human salespeople who might be stressed or impatient. If customers are still unhappy, they can opt to talk to a human, but they might prefer the friendly interaction with the AI agent.\n\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It’s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you’re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to—but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\n\nRevolutionizing Everyday Life: How AI Outperforms Humans in Healthcare, Driving, and Beyond\n\nCramer added that AI's potential extends beyond retail. He believes that in ten years, we might wonder why we relied on doctors when AI agents could provide kinder, more empathetic care. These AI systems could analyze millions of test results, quickly identifying serious health issues like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer, making it easier to spot dangerous patterns before they become serious problems. AI's ability to compile and analyze data effectively is key to this advancement.\n\n\"It’s not just retail. In ten years, I think we’ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor’s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic—like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It’s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer pointed out that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He noted that AI can also handle tasks like proofreading and correcting errors without making mistakes. This efficiency allows law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They’re much safer than human drivers. They don’t drink and drive—they don’t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\n\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents often perform better than humans in most situations. For repetitive tasks, he believes it's preferable to interact with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed or frustrated human who may not want to engage.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you’d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn’t want to deal with you.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, highlighting ten key stocks he reviewed. We ranked them by hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA technician testing the latest 5G device, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation.\n\nQUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 100\n\nJim Cramer reported that JPMorgan has lowered its price target for QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) from $230 to $210 per share but maintained its buy rating. Analysts noted that QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is likely to lose modem revenue as Apple continues to develop and source its mobile components.\n\n\"JPMorgan cut its Qualcomm price target to $210 per share from $230 but kept its buy rating. The analysts said, however, that Qualcomm is about to lose modem revenue as Club name Apple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL) continues efforts to make and source mobile components in-house.\"\n\nQUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is backed by strong earnings, its leadership in 5G technology, and growing opportunities in the automotive and IoT markets. In its latest quarterly report, QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)  reported revenues of $8.45 billion for Q3 2023, fueled by high demand for smartphone chips and increased royalty income.\n\nAs a major player in the 5G market, QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)  stands to benefit from the rapid global adoption of 5G technology, which is essential for smartphones and many connected devices. QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is also expanding into the automotive sector with its Snapdragon platform for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected vehicles, presenting significant growth opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is forming strategic partnerships with leading tech companies to enhance its market position and drive innovation. Recent announcements about new automotive partnerships and advancements in 5G technology underscore  QUALCOMM  Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)'s commitment to future growth, supporting a strong bullish outlook on its prospects.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading wireless communications technology company, was the largest contributor for the quarter. After a period of weaker global demand for smartphones (driven by a slowdown in China) and elevated channel inventory, demand from Chinese handset manufacturers accelerated 40% year‐over‐year. More importantly, in our opinion, Qualcomm continues to execute on a previously identified catalyst of shifting its business mix beyond smartphones.\n\nThe company announced increased progress for its automotive and Internet of Things (IoT)solutions. Within auto, the increase in vehicle content has resulted in 35% year‐over‐year revenue growth, with a design win pipeline of ~$45 billion, keeping the company on track to achieving ~$4 billion in auto‐related revenues by 2026. In recent years, despite persistent threats of insourcing from large clients (most notably Apple), Qualcomm has been able to retain its high market share in handsets while simultaneously expanding in non‐smartphone devices.\n\nWe believe this progress is a testament to Qualcomm’s history of high (and productive) R&D spending, resulting in technological superiority. We believe Qualcomm’s technologies will continue to benefit as the world stays on a path toward a proliferation of connectivity between varying devices and as AI applications extend from the cloud to on‐device.”\n\nOverall QCOM ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's key stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QCOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pre-order demand in Russia for the new iPhone is 15% higher than for its predecessor, one reseller told Reuters on Friday, even though it is at least 50% more expensive than in the West.\n\nRussia legalised so-called \"grey\" or \"parallel\" imports to allow goods to enter the country without the brands' permission after Western companies such as iPhone maker Apple imposed export bans in 2022 in response to the war in Ukraine.\n\nLyudmila Semushina, a spokesperson for electronics retailer restore:, said the iPhones going on sale this month had arrived in Russia from \"all over\", without naming specific countries.\n\nCountries that have not imposed sanctions against Moscow, such as Turkey, China, India, Kazakhstan and other former Soviet states, have seen sharp increases in trade with Russia since the conflict began.\n\n\"Comparing with last year's pre-order, (demand) is 15% higher than pre-orders were for the iPhone 15,\" Semushina said.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on sales and pricing of the new model in Russia.\n\nPre-orders were launched on Sept. 10 and physical sales are expected to start next week, retailers said, though Russians will have to stomach higher prices.\n\nElectronics retailer M.Video said prices would start at 112,999 roubles ($1,225) for the 128GB iPhone 16, over $400 more expensive than the U.S. price of $799. The 1TB iPhone Pro Max was available for pre-order in Russia for 249,999 roubles ($2,710), compared to the U.S. price of $1,599.\n\nWhen big brands left Russia and the switch was made to parallel imports, Semushina said her company stopped making official calculations on the premium Russian consumers pay.\n\n\"There is an official retailer's price, there are prices of grey sellers - those who bring their hardware in suitcases - so prices may vary,\" she said.\n\nShe said the company had not had any contact with Apple since the conflict began. Apart from suspending all product sales in Russia in March 2022, the tech giant has also halted services like ApplePay.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +1.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AAPL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.52 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.63 billion and $424.09 billion estimates indicate +1.9% and +8.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nike CEO changeup has investors optimistic as it returns to its product roots",
        "content": "Nike (NKE) investors are running with the idea of 32-year insider Elliott Hill returning the sneaker giant to glory as CEO, and cleaning up the messes of its outgoing tech-focused c-suite chief.\n\nShares of Nike are up over 7% in pre-market trading on Friday, following the announcement late Thursday that current CEO John Donahoe plans to retire, effective Oct. 13. He will stay on as an advisor until January 2025.\n\nThis comes as Nike's board — which includes founder Phil Knight, former long-time CEO Mark Parker and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook — sees it fit to refocus on improved product and re-establishing relationships cast aside by Donahoe (like Foot Locker (FL)).\n\nThe move also arrives ahead of a key Nov. 19 investor day for Nike, where many on the Street now expect reset financial guidance as Hill assesses operations.\n\nHill, 61, will have one month in the role before that gathering.\n\n\"The Board concluded it was clear Elliott’s global expertise, leadership style, and deep understanding of our industry and partners, paired with his passion for sport, our brands, products, consumers, athletes, and employees, make him the right person to lead Nike’s next stage of growth,\" Parker said in a press release.\n\nA stronger stock price for Nike wouldn't hurt, either.\n\nShares have fallen 20% between January 13, 2020 — when Donahoe joined as CEO — and September 19's market close, per Yahoo Finance data.\n\nIn Hill, Nike gets a true insider who could use his intimate knowledge of the company to move quickly to enact change.\n\nHe started as an intern and apparel sales representative in 1988 in Memphis, the year the iconic 'Just Do It' slogan was created. Nike's revenue was roughly $1 billion at the time.\n\nHill has said the competitive Nike culture is the reason he stuck with the global sneaker giant, and even moved with the company to 7 different cities, including Amsterdam. The journey saw him work closely on the Jordan brand, among others.\n\nHe ultimately retired in 2020 after leading Nike's consumer and marketplace business as president. Some believed Hill was poised to take over as CEO from Parker, but Knight interjected and was able to push through his long-time friend, board member, and former EBay (EBAY) CEO Donahoe as its next leader.\n\nDonahoe managed the business through the COVID-19 pandemic, but cast aside important relationships with key vendors such as Foot Locker. His consulting centric management style — honed at Bain — also rubbed folks inside Nike the wrong way.\n\nHill is the right pick at the right time for Nike, says Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"He's a product guy, he's ran retail in EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa], in North America, he knows the company and the product very well,\" Sherman told Yahoo Finance (video above), plus \"he's also very liked at Nike.\"\n\nSherman rates Nike's stock at Out-perform.\n\nThat expands beyond internal connections, per BMO Capital Markets' Simeon Siegel. Hill is \"known-and-liked internally and with retail partners, potentially driving an immediate morale boost,\" Siegel told clients in a note.\n\nSiegel has an Out-perform rating on Nike as well. Sep 11, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; The Nike shoes worn by Seattle Storm center Mercedes Russell in the first half against the LA Sparks at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images (USA TODAY Sports via Reuters Connect / Reuters)\n\nNike is up against it so to speak in jump-starting Nike financials.\n\nThe company's net profits dropped to $6.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year, down from $6.9 billion two years ago. Operating profit margins during this time decreased to 12.7% from 14.7%.\n\nWall Street pros point to the proliferation of On Holding (ONON), Skechers (SKX), and Hoka (DECK) sneakers as a key reason for Nike's stumbles. Donahoe's focus on expanding Nike's own stores at the expense of long-held distribution agreements has also weighed on performance.\n\nFour items Hill needs to tackle on day one include regaining investor optimism after the company lost focus of its product and marketing roots, streamline product innovation, rebuild relationships with its distribution partners, and claw back lost market share.\n\n\"After four years away, Hill will face the challenge of adapting to significant changes in the market, including heightened competition, evolving distribution and brand-building channels, and most critically, shifts in product innovation. While his deep understanding of the company is an asset, his ability to navigate these shifts will help determine Nike's future success,\" Jefferies analyst Randy Konik wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAll of which makes the Nov. 19 investor day a must-watch for beleaguered Nike investors.\n\nHe needs to \"set some targets, give investors a sense of where this company is headed and what kind of numbers to expect, what kind of algorithm to expect for growth and earnings growth. That will set the course of of investor expectations and probably stabilize the stock a little bit and then he needs to do more work,\" Sherman says.\n\nAdds Sherman, \"If the targets sound reasonable, the goals sound reasonable and will give him a pass for the next six months to a year to fix the ship before it starts working again.\"\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple's iPhone 16 is in stores now — but it's missing a key selling point",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) latest lineup of iPhones hit stores on Friday, but it’s notably missing one of its key selling points that the tech giant is hoping will convince users to upgrade their older models.\n\nThe iPhone 16, which is now stocked on Apple store shelves in some 60 countries, will come equipped with iOS 18, making it the company’s first artificial intelligence-capable iPhone. But its suite of AI features, which it has dubbed Apple Intelligence, will only become available as a software update next month.\n\nPre-order demand for the smartphones has already appeared weaker than expected.\n\nIn the first weekend since its debut, Apple sold about 37 million iPhone 16 smartphones — down almost 13% from iPhone 15 first-weekend sales a year ago, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Monday. Pre-orders were dragged down by lower interest in the Pro models, largely because of the staggered release of Apple Intelligence, Kuo said.\n\n“One of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release,” he said.\n\nApple Intelligence will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro models or higher, a fact that analysts have said would drive an upgrade “super cycle,” and mark a new era of growth for the tech giant.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) chief Mike Sievert has pushed back against claims of weak demand for the newest slate of iPhones, calling them “nonsense” in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. He said sales of the iPhone 16 were “‘not only good, but better than last year.”\n\n“People are buying Pros, they’re buying Maxes, so they’re buying up the food chain, and they’re buying at a greater rate than last year,” Sievert said.\n\nAn analysis of pre-orders by Jefferies (JEF) released Wednesday found that demand for the new iPhone lineup is slowly beginning to improve in the U.S., with delivery times for the iPhone 16 Pro reaching two to three weeks in seven major cities analyzed by the investment bank. But that’s still below last year’s levels.\n\nRecent research into the reasons why people upgrade their smartphones found that a just 18% of consumers buy a new iPhone because of new features. A majority only opt to upgrade their smartphones once they become obsolete, or are stolen or damaged.\n\nIt’s not just iPhones coming on to the scene Friday. Other products making their debut on store shelves worldwide include the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and new AirPods models.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\n\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\n\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\n\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\n\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\n\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\n\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\n\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\n\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors. We analyzed the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, focusing on high-quality US stocks with strong competitive advantages. We ranked the top 10 based on market cap and hedge fund holdings.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 184\n\nMarket Cap as of September 18, 2024: $3.30 Trillion\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the go-to company for any investor eyeing exposure to developing and selling high-profile devices at the heart of the digital revolution. One of the reasons it remains one of the best forever stocks to buy now has to do with the iPhone product line. While the iPhone business has come under pressure in recent years, it has found a new lease of growth with the integration of AI in the iPhone 16, which is expected to fuel demand and drive sales.\n\nWhile the focus has always been on the hardware business, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term prospects remain intact as the services business is increasingly becoming an important part of underlying growth. The segment grew by 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% growth last year.\n\nWith more than 2.2 billion active Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices in circulation, Apple is well positioned to generate significant revenues by selling various services through App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more.\n\nThe company remains in a solid financial position, having exited the first quarter with $39.895 billion in operating cash flow and a free cash flow of about $37.5 billion. With a market cap of over $3 trillion, a debt portfolio of $101 billion is insignificant for a company that generates a free cash flow of upwards of $30 billion. Likewise, the company returns value to shareholders with a dividend yield of 0.46% while offering buybacks.\n\nBy June 2024 end, 184 out of the 912 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm’s investors. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a stake valued at $84.25 billion, making it the biggest holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.\n\nHere is what Mar Vista Focus strategy said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An action-packed week on Wall Street ends with a bang as index-tracking funds are set to reshuffle $250 billion of shares, just as a “triple witching” trading event hits.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density\n\nEquity gauges from S&P Dow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell will be revamped Friday, with this quarterly activity forecast to be the busiest in almost four years thanks to tech-driven market gyrations.\n\nApple Inc.’s weighting will be increased in key benchmarks after Warren Buffett’s recent share sale. At the same time, new S&P index-capping rules, which govern allocations for the largest companies, are scheduled to kick in.\n\nWith fresh demand among benchmark trackers for the likes of Apple and new additions to the S&P 500 — Palantir Technologies Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. — computer and software shares will buck the broad trend of net outflows for other industries, Piper Sandler & Co. estimates show.\n\nAll told, tech names are expected to see $40 billion of net buying, with Apple making up the bulk, Piper data shows.\n\n“Tech will be the only sector net to buy,” said Michael Kantrowitz, Piper’s chief investment strategist.\n\nThe rebalance is set to round out a big week, between the Federal Reserve’s first interest-rate cut in four years and a quarterly episode known as triple witching. With $5.1 trillion of derivatives tied to stocks and indexes scheduled to mature Friday, that can spur market turbulence as traders roll over their existing positions or start new ones.\n\nStill, the index-related reshuffle is by no means an ominous event. Given money managers tend to trade stocks near the session’s close in order to avoid unnecessary deviation from benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000, that spurt of concentrated volume can provide a window of robust liquidity for the broader market.\n\nThe iPhone maker’s index representation is set to increase after Buffett’s sale fully unleashed the amount of stock available for trading. In turn, index-tracking funds will need to purchase the shares to mimic its growing heft.\n\nAdditionally, S&P rejigged the rules that determine the influence wielded by the largest firms in its select sector indexes.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg declares Meta ‘the opposite’ of Apple in comments reigniting Tim Cook feud",
        "content": "If Mark Zuckerberg’s new laid-back look—complete with shaggy hair and chunky gold chain—is any indication, he’s much different from the straightlaced, crew-cutted Apple CEO Tim Cook. It’s no wonder, then, that the business philosophies of Zuckerberg’s Meta and Apple are as different as their two leaders. Zuckerberg has been eager to point out those differences and prod at a decades-long feud between the two tech giants and their chief executives.\n\nWhile Meta has prioritized acting fast and engaging users, such as through its open-sourcing of its Llama AI model, Zuckerberg said in the Acquired podcast episode released Tuesday, Apple prefers maintaining a closed ecosystem of polished, exclusive products.\n\n\"I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,\" he said. \"Clearly, their stuff has worked really well too. They take this approach that's like, 'We're going to take a long time, we're going to polish it, we're going to put it out,' and maybe for the stuff that they're doing that works, maybe that just fits with their culture.\"\n\nSince Tim Cook took the helm of the tech behemoth, Apple has prided itself on being the best, rather than the first. For the most part, it’s worked out for the company, demonstrated by its superlative of the world's largest smartphone provider. Apple has long tended to its walled garden of in-house products, which has resulted in a uniform line of apps and accessories bespoke to its tech—and a whopping antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice.\n\nBut Zuckerberg touted Meta’s own spaghetti-at-the-wall approach to its products, which he believes has elicited helpful critiques and enabled the company to grow in spite of its failures.\n\n\"You want to really have a culture that values shipping and getting things out and getting feedback more than needing always to get great positive accolades from people when you put stuff out,\" he said.\n\nThere’s certainly been no shortage of feedback toward Meta, exemplified by social media platform Thread’s meteoric rise to 100 million users, only for the number of accounts to atrophy weeks later. Its flagship Metaverse was a $46.5 billion failure, but that still hasn’t stopped Zuckerberg from adding $58 billion to his net worth this year.\n\nApple’s perfectionism has been at its own expense, Zuckerberg said, arguing the company prioritizes praise above constructive feedback from users.\n\n\"If you want to wait until you get praised all the time,” he said, “you're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s requests for comment.\n\nBillionaires butting heads\n\nZuckerberg’s commentary on Apple’s ways of doing business is not the first time he’s shared his thoughts on Cook’s company. For over a decade, he and Cook have differed on their philosophies not only on how to roll out products, but on the future of the internet more broadly.\n\nEarlier this month Meta and Apple’s feud reached a fever pitch after Meta urged greater government regulation of social media platforms, suggesting Apple and Google set age restrictions and requirements for parental consent. But Apple disagreed, arguing the onus for restrictions should be placed on the platform themselves.\n\nTensions between the two companies have been tightening since 2014, when Cook suggested Facebook made its money through the collection of personal data. The following year, Apple unveiled its motto, “Privacy is a fundamental human right.” Cook also lambasted Facebook as a hotbed for Russian misinformation used to mislead American voters ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nZuckerberg seems keen on fanning the flames of the tech rivalry today, calling Apple Meta’s “primary competitor” on Tuesday’s podcast. Cook historically has not agreed.\n\n\"Oh, I think that we compete in some things,\" Cook said in 2021. \"But no, if I may ask who our biggest competitors are, they would not be listed. We're not in the social networking business.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Strategic Reduction in Bank of America Holdings",
        "content": "On September 19, 2024, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm made a notable adjustment in its investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). This transaction involved the sale of 22,272,071 shares at a price of $40.23 each. Following this move, the firm still holds a substantial number of shares, totaling 835,908,435, which represents a 10.77% ownership in the company. This adjustment has led to a slight decrease in the portfolio's exposure to Bank of America, now accounting for 12.05% of the total holdings.\n\nProfile of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a towering figure in the investment world. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has transformed a modest textile company into a major conglomerate, primarily focusing on insurance and other diverse investments. Buffett's investment philosophy, deeply influenced by Benjamin Graham, emphasizes understanding a business's fundamentals, long-term prospects, and management quality, while insisting on a significant margin of safety. Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings include major names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), reflecting a strong inclination towards financially sound companies. Warren Buffett's Strategic Reduction in Bank of America Holdings\n\nDetails of the Trade\n\nThe recent transaction marks a reduction of 2.60% in Buffett's holdings of Bank of America shares, impacting the portfolio by -0.32%. Despite this sale, Bank of America remains a significant component of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, underscoring the firm's ongoing confidence in the bank's value and stability.\n\nBank of America at a Glance\n\nBank of America is one of the leading financial institutions in the United States, with operations spanning across consumer banking, global wealth management, and investment banking. As of the latest data, the company boasts a market capitalization of $317.13 billion and a stock price of $40.87, slightly above the GF Value of $38.45, indicating the stock is fairly valued. The bank's diverse business operations and substantial market presence make it a significant player in the financial sector. Warren Buffett's Strategic Reduction in Bank of America Holdings\n\nFinancial Performance and Market Position\n\nBank of America's stock has shown a year-to-date increase of 20.56%, with a substantial growth of 818.43% since its IPO in 1973. The bank maintains a GF Score of 82/100, indicating good potential for future performance. The stock's profitability and growth ranks are commendable, reflecting its solid market standing and business model efficacy.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Industry Analysis\n\nWithin the banking industry, Bank of America stands out due to its comprehensive service range and substantial asset base.

Each brings a unique investment strategy to the table, although like Buffett, they all recognize the intrinsic value and stability offered by Bank of America.\n\nConclusion\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent reduction in Bank of America shares reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a shift in long-term confidence. For value investors and market watchers, this move highlights the importance of portfolio rebalancing and risk management, even when dealing with large, stable entities like Bank of America.

        "title": "Apple iPhone 16 Reaches Stores Without Its Highly Awaited AI Features",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is facing an unprecedented challenge: persuading customers to buy its latest iPhones without their biggest new feature.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density\n\nOn Friday, Apple is launching the iPhone 16 lineup in almost 60 countries, including the US, China, India, Australia and South Korea. But the device won’t come installed with Apple Intelligence — the much-anticipated AI software that the company has been touting since June. That means users will have to download the software features over time as they become available during the coming weeks and months.\n\nThat’s put Apple in a tricky spot. It’s already marketing the AI features heavily, but some consumers may hold off on buying the new phones if they can’t enjoy the benefits right away. The new iPhone hardware, meanwhile, has only modest upgrades from prior models. A touch-sensitive Camera Control button that makes it easier to take pictures and video is the most notable change.\n\nEven so, Wall Street remains bullish that Apple can accelerate growth during the all-important holiday season. Analysts estimate that revenue will increase 8% in the December quarter — the best showing for that period since the end of calendar 2021.\n\nThe new lineup includes two standard models — the 16 and 16 Plus — as well as the higher-end Pro and Pro Max. Preorders of the devices began last week, with shipments to stores and customers getting underway Friday.\n\nIt’s rare to see huge crowds of iPhone shoppers at Apple stores these days, but some diehard fans have lined up at locations around the world. The big question will be whether ordinary consumers snap up the new model as well.\n\nThe initial units going on sale will run iOS 18 operating system, but Apple Intelligence will require an over-the-air update to the iOS 18.1 software, which is launching in October.\n\nApple Intelligence was announced in June at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference and has been available in a limited beta test for developers for the past several weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, Apple released a public beta version of Apple Intelligence — one aimed at a wider audience — though most customers won’t access it until the suite of features is released in its final form next month. Additional capabilities won’t be ready until later, part of a staggered launch that will stretch into next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen the technology titan introduced the iPhone 16 line, it said that the devices were the first to be built “from the ground up” for Apple Intelligence. But some iPhones from last year — the 15 Pro and Pro Max — will be able to support the features as well.\n\nThe look of the new phones is little changed from the iPhone 12 design from 2020. But they feature noticeable battery-life improvements and camera advancements — beyond the new button. Prices start at $799 for the standard iPhone, ranging up to $1,199 for the Pro Max.\n\nIn past years, consumers ordering phones from Apple’s online store have seen major shipping delays — a sign that supply wasn’t meeting demand. That’s been less of an issue this year, either because orders are slower or Apple just has more phones on hand.\n\nNew orders of the regular iPhone 16 models will be delivered by early October, while the Pro versions will arrive around the middle of the month.\n\nApple also unveiled lower-end AirPods this month and updated watches. The new earbuds — dubbed AirPods 4 — are available in a $129 and $179 versions, with the latter model including noise cancellation. That feature had previously been reserved for the upscale AirPods Pro, which cost $249.\n\nApple’s latest smartwatches, meanwhile, don’t offer a major reason to upgrade. The new Series 10 has a larger display and thinner design, but otherwise looks similar to the Series 9. The company’s only change to the higher-end Ultra model, meanwhile, is a black color option. Still, the products could attract customers who have older Apple Watches or are new to the category.\n\nThe iPhone, watches and AirPods won’t be the last new Apple products of 2024. The company also is planning a major Mac computer overhaul later this year.\n\nApple will bring its AI-focused M4 processor from the iPad to the MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop. It’s also preparing the most significant overhaul to the Mac mini in the product’s two-decade history, complete with a smaller design and new chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success How a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "content": "Apple is accelerating the rollout of a software update that will implant artificial intelligence into its virtual assistant Siri and automate a variety of tedious tasks to coincide with the release of its latest iPhone.\n\nThe free update enabling the first set of features in Apple's suite of artificial intelligence became available Thursday — about two weeks ahead of the October release that Apple projected earlier this month when it unveiled the iPhone 16.\n\nApple didn’t say why its artificial intelligence software is coming out ahead of its original schedule, but the technology is a marquee attraction in the four iPhone 16 models arriving in stores Friday.\n\nAll iPhone 16 models, with starting prices ranging from $800 to $1,200, are equipped with a special processor required for the new technology, which the company is marketing as “Apple Intelligence.” That branding is part of an effort to distinguish the iPhone’s AI from similar technology already available in smartphones released earlier this year by Samsung and Google.\n\nThe AI technology is coming out in U.S. English only for now, but will expand into localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December. Apple plans to expand into other languages and countries next year.\n\nOnce the iOS 18.1 upgrade is installed, the often bumbling Siri is supposed to become more conversational, versatile and colorful, with a glowing light that will rotate around the iPhone's screen as it responds to requests. While Apple is promising Siri will be able to perform more tasks and be less prone to becoming confused, it won't be able to interact with other apps installed on the iPhone until another software update comes out at a still-unspecified date.\n\nOther AI features in the software update will handle a variety of writing and proofreading tasks, summarize the content of emails and other documents. The AI also will provide a variety of editing tools to alter the appearance of photos and make it easier to find old pictures.\n\nBut the update doesn't include other AI tricks still to come, such as the ability to create customized emojis on the fly or conjure other fanciful imagery upon request. Apple also plans to eventually enable its AI suite to get a helping hand from OpenAI's ChatGPT when users want it.\n\nBesides the new iPhone model, Apple's AI features also will work in two premium versions of the iPhone 15 after the software update to the recently released iOS 18 is installed. That's because both the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also came with the computer chip needed to power the new AI. The update will also bring the ability to record spatial video on those two iPhone 15 models that can be watched on Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the AI won't work on hundreds of millions of other iPhones, a drawback that investors are betting will juice Apple's recently slumping sales of the ubiquitous device.\n\nThat expectation is the main reason that Apple's stock price has climbed by more than 15% since the company previewed its AI strategy in June, creating $500 billion in shareholder wealth. Some analysts believe the demand for new iPhones could propel Apple's market value above $4 trillion for the first time within the next year.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "T-Mobile CEO talks Sprint merger, iPhone 16 demand, what's next",
        "content": "High-octane T-Mobile (TMUS) CEO Mike Sievert is back with more big promises to investors four years after his company's last capital markets day with Wall Street.\n\nThe company is targeting a compound annual services revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 5% through 2027, up from its current pace of about 4%, execs outlined at an analyst event on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nT-Mobile is also aiming for $10 billion more in adjusted operating profits through 2027 compared to 2023, with a projected range of $38 billion to $39 billion.\n\nWall Street was modeling for $37.8 billion in 2027 adjusted operating profits ahead of the event.\n\nThe company promised $50 billion in dividends and stock buybacks through 2027, as well.\n\n\"We said we would combine these two companies [Sprint and T-Mobile] and complete the most successful merger of scaled telecoms in the history of the industry, and we did that, and we unlocked the value in excess of what we promised. And now it's time for the next chapter,\" Sievert said on Yahoo Finance moments after the event concluded.\n\nAdded Sievert, \"We wanted to unveil these plans because investors want to know, after that historically successful run of the last few years, what's next.\"\n\nT-Mobile stock is up 69% in the past four years, compared to a 27% drop for Verizon (VZ) and a 1% decline for AT&T (T). T-Mobile Sievert lays out some big growth targets for Wall Street to digest at an analyst day on Wednesday. (T-Mobile)\n\nBarring an economic collapse or recession, there's good reason to believe T-Mobile could hit its new guidance.\n\nFor one, the company beat all its guidance for 2020 as adjusted operating profits rose 32% and free cash flow improved by 400%.\n\nConsumers are continuing to upgrade to 5G cellphones and higher-speed home broadband, and the company has recently made a host of key deals.\n\nRead more: Cell phones, furniture, used cars: Here's where prices are easing up as inflation cooldown continues\n\nT-Mobile's $1.35 billion Mint Mobile deal closed in May, giving the company access to more value-conscious phone plan shoppers.\n\nThe company is also looking to close on deals for fiber-optic plays Metronet ($4.9 billion), US Cellular ($4.4 billion), and Lumos ($950 million).\n\n\"The company [US Cellular] has always been great at smaller markets in rural areas, and that's a big growth strategy for us,\" said Sievert.\n\nIf there is a wildcard on how T-Mobile's analyst day will be digested, it will be the cost to build out the fiber-optic network. Sievert acknowledged the company is still assessing if they need to go after the opportunity even further.\n\n\"While there’s comfort in management’s long track record of beat-and-raises from an operational and financial lens, investors remain somewhat unsettled on the fiber strategy for now,\" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nJayant rates T-Mobile shares at an Outperform rating.\n\nT-Mobile's second quarter showed a telecom business still in growth mode.\n\nTotal sales rose 4% from the prior year to $16.4 billion. The company notched 1.3 million net customer additions, pushing it past 100 million postpaid customers for the first time.\n\nAdjusted operating profits increased 9%, while diluted earnings per share improved 34% year over year.\n\nFor the full year, T-Mobile expects net customer additions of 5.4 million to 5.7 million. Previously it projected 5.2 million to 5.6 million.\n\nHitting guidance in 2024 will be partially dependent on Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 16 demand, which has reportedly come out of the gate slow in terms of preorders.\n\n\"It [the outlook] might mean that the demand cycle will be a little bit more stretched out as word of mouth builds after people actually get the AI features later. But already our sales are higher than last year. Last year was a good year. Good iPhone launch. This year, they're higher. We're seeing preference for the Pro versus the regular edition,\" Sievert said.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Dow’s Lack of AI Stocks Puts Blue-Chip Index ‘Behind the Curve’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The rise of artificial intelligence has reordered the American stock market, pushing the likes of Nvidia Corp. and other chipmakers into the upper echelons. There’s one storied corner, though, where the changes wrought by AI haven’t shown up: the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads\n\nThe 128-year-old blue-chip index doesn’t include Nvidia or Broadcom Inc. Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also missing. Much of that owes to how the Dow is constituted — a committee selects the 30 components and weights them by price rather than market capitalization.\n\nThe overseers try to balance membership across sectors, so tech is represented, but to some degree by yesteryear’s titans: Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. The trio are all long-term underperformers among large-cap tech.\n\nThe omission of any true AI play after the technology has dominated market returns for nearly two years is again raising questions about the utility of the Dow average while also revitalizing the age-old parlor game of trying to guess when the committee will shuffle membership and how.\n\n“With AI, the economy is really going through a shift like the 90s with the Internet. I think the Dow is missing that theme,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. That’s left the index “behind the curve,” she said. While Nvidia and Broadcom would be the most obvious AI-focused additions, the latter may be a better pick because it tends to be less volatile, Tengler said.\n\nThe lack of some high-flying tech stocks — and a lower allocation to the sector overall compared with the S&P 500 Index — helps explain why the Dow has lagged other gauges for years. Since the start of 2010, it has returned more than 470%, including dividends, compared with the S&P 500’s about 580% gain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is up more than 1,100%.\n\nTo be sure, The Dow isn’t intended to mirror the overall equity market, but rather act as a cross-section of American-based companies. Its methodology states that stock selection “is not governed by quantitative rules,” with names typically added “if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHamish Preston, head of US Equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that the Dow’s eligibility criteria have evolved and are frequently reviewed. “They may well be adjusted over time depending on what the committee deems relevant to ensure that the indices remain relevant,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe Dow’s method for stock selection is unusual compared with other indexes. While the S&P 500 has a quarterly review process — and recently added two more AI-related stocks — the Dow’s committee has no set schedule to make adjustments. The last change occurred in February when Amazon and Uber Technologies replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance and JetBlue Airways. In adding Amazon, S&P Dow Jones Indices cited the “evolving nature of the American economy.”\n\nTo be sure, the index does have some exposure to AI already. Microsoft Corp. is integrating ChatGPT technology into its software products and has been a Dow component for almost 25 years. Apple Inc., which is making AI services a cornerstone of its newest iPhones, was added in 2015, a few years after it became the world’s most valuable company.\n\nBut with the biggest names in the burgeoning industry missing, some say changes are overdue.\n\n“It’s clear that the Dow is going to do something that reflects AI,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “They’re almost compelled to.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple is set to be warned by the European Union to open up its highly guarded iPhone operating system to rival technologies, or eventually risk significant fines. Ampere Computing LLC, the semiconductor startup backed by Larry Ellison’s Oracle Corp., is exploring a potential sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Elon Musk’s X skirted a ban of the social media network in Brazil though an automatic update of its software, an association of Brazilian internet providers said Wednesday. Japan’s Icom Inc., whose brand appears on walkie-talkies that exploded in Lebanon, said it halted production a decade ago of the model allegedly used in the attacks and is still investigating the situation. Nintendo Co. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Tokyo-based Pocketpair Inc., the maker of hit game Palworld, seeking an injunction and compensation for damages.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nEndava\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Man Who Made Nike Uncool Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "content": "S&P 500, Dow Jones Hit Record Highs: Magnificent 7 Add $400 Billion After Fed's Historic Interest Rate Cut\n\nBulls are stampeding across Wall Street on Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates for the first time in over four years.\n\nThe central bank’s bold move, a 50-basis-point cut, caught analysts off guard and sent the U.S. stock market to fresh record highs at the opening of Thursday’s session.\n\nThe S&P 500 soared to a new all-time high, reaching 5,700 points. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to an unprecedented 42,000 points.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose by 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.5%, although the Russell 2000, representing small-cap stocks, outperformed with a surge of over 2%.\n\nThe market rally was primarily driven by the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of the Magnificent Seven are recording daily gains ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, solidly in positive territory.\n\nChart: S&P 500 Hits Record Highs\n\nImage: Benzinga Pro\n\nStrong Labor Market Eases Slowdown Fears, Analysts Boost Rate-Cut Wagers\n\nThursday’s economic data further boosted investor confidence. Weekly jobless claims came in well below expectations, suggesting a lower-than-expected trend of rising unemployment.\n\nContinuing jobless claims also dropped more than expected, hinting at a potential absorption of long-term unemployed individuals into the job market.\n\nThis data alleviated concerns about rising unemployment and provided a more optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nWall Street analysts quickly adjusted their expectations following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. There is now growing anticipation of additional rate cuts, diverging from the cautious tone expressed in the Fed’s September “dot plot” and Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks during the press conference.\n\nNotably, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius revised his forecast from expecting a 25-basis-point cut at every other meeting to predicting a rate cut at every meeting. He even left the door open for a back-to-back 50-basis-point reduction in November.\n\nThursday’s 5 Top-Performing S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAmong the S&P 500, the top five performers as of 10 a.m. ET were:\n\nName 1-day Return Darden Restaurants, Inc.

        "title": "Resellers are hiking prices on Huawei's 'trifold' smartphone before it's even out",
        "content": "Huawei is preparing to release its new ‘trifold’ smartphone on Friday — the same day as Apple’s (AAPL) latest iPhone comes out — but it’s already being listed in China for up to three times its price.\n\nThe Chinese tech giant’s new Mate XT smartphone starts at 19,999 yuan, or $2,800, but scalpers are listing the smartphone on resale sites for between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan, or about $8,500 to $9,900, amid high demand, Lin Shen, a second-hand smartphone dealer, told the South China Morning Post (BABA).\n\n“The prices at Huaqiangbei [, a Shenzhen-based electronics wholesale marketplace,] are still very unstable,” Lin told the SCMP. “Most of the interest is from scalpers who are looking to resell [the Mate XT] and make a profit from the price difference.”\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHuawei’s trifold smartphone received over 3 million preorders before its debut just hours after Apple’s iPhone 16 unveiling. Pre-orders for the smartphone started on September 7, and did not require a deposit. And as Apple touted artificial intelligence features for its upcoming iPhone models, Huawei said its Mate XT, which uses the company’s Kylin chip, features an AI-powered assistant for text summarization, translation, and editing.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a note that a recent supply chain survey shows 2024 shipments for the tri-fold smartphone have been revised up to 1 million units from 500,000, but noted previous instances of a drop in demand for Huawei’s flagship products after release.\n\nSince releasing its Mate 60 Pro smartphone series last August, Huawei has outpaced Apple in the Chinese smartphone market. In April, the company reported a rise in profit for the fourth consecutive quarter, also showing resilience against U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing China’s advanced chip efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s iPhone sales fell 19% over the same period — its worst performance in China since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Apple’s share of China’s smartphone market also fell year-over-year in the first quarter of 2024 from 19.7%to 15.7%. The company has had to cut prices on some iPhone models in the Chinese market as competition grows with Huawei and other homegrown smartphone-makers.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese online retailers are cutting prices of the iPhone 16 ahead of its official release in the country, as they wait for Apple’s AI features to roll out, the SCMP reported.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union said Thursday it will outline steps to compel Apple to open up its iPhone and iPad operating systems to competing technologies under the bloc's tough new digital rulebook, which threatens hefty fines for breaches.\n\nThe EU's executive branch, the European Commission, said it has opened two “specification proceedings” that will spell out what Apple needs to do under the 27-nation bloc's Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe DMA is designed to prevent Big Tech “gatekeepers” from dominating digital markets, including by breaking up closed tech ecosystems. It requires tech companies to make their systems operate with rivals, allowing consumers to switch more easily between platforms.\n\nOne proceeding will focus on how connected devices like smartwatches and headphones will have “effective interoperability” with Apple's operating system. The other will look at how Apple deals with interoperability requests from software developers for iOS and IPadOS, which should be done in a \"transparent, timely and fair\" way, the commission said.\n\nDuring this process, which will take up to six months, the commission will send its findings to Apple. It’s the first time the commission has used this process since the DMA took effect earlier this year. The bloc is already investigating Apple over its App Store rules for developers.\n\nThe commission's executive vice president in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said in a press release that the process will “provide clarity” for developers and Apple.\n\nApple said it has “created ways for apps in the European Union to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS while protecting our users.”\n\n“Undermining the protections we’ve built over time would put European consumers at risk,\" the company said, adding it will continue to “work constructively” with commission.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\n\nShould Investors Be Overly Cautious?\n\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\n\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\n\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\n“...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.”\n\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\n\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\n\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\n\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $3383.75 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's largest technology companies by revenue, known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.\n\nThe revenue in FQ3 2024 was up 4.87% year-over-year and reached $85.78 billion. The services division set a record at $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, despite a slight decline. Moreover, Mac revenue grew 2% to $7 billion, and iPad revenue surged 24% year-over-year.\n\nThe company also launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event in September unfolded as anticipated, with attention shifting to pre-order data and sales figures for the new iPhone. A survey by US AlphaWise indicated that about 60% of customers planning to upgrade are doing so because of Apple Intelligence. Even more advanced AI features will further roll out in 2025.\n\nOn August 29, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is considering a significant investment in OpenAI, alongside NVIDIA, as part of a funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value OpenAI at $100 billion.\n\nCurrently, 184 hedge funds are long AAPL. Berkshire Hathaway has the highest stake in the company, with a position of $84,248,000,000.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian retailers have launched pre-sales of Apple's latest iPhone, circumventing the company's export ban to Russia and giving consumers the chance to pre-order devices hundreds of dollars more expensive than in the United States.\n\nRussia's leading electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado and mobile network operator MTS both claimed on Thursday to be the first in Russia to unveil Apple's new iPhone 16.\n\nM.Video said phone deliveries would begin from next week. MTS said it expected physical sales to begin very soon.\n\nApple paused all its product sales in Russia in March 2022 and halted services like ApplePay in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine while Western-imposed sanctions sought to curb technology exports to Russia.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside U.S. business hours.\n\nRussians will have to fork out several hundred dollars more than U.S. consumers for the iPhone 16.\n\nForeign brands that halted exports to Russia now take circuitous routes to reach consumers, typically through countries that have not imposed sanctions on Russia, such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, China, India and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nReuters could not determine which route into the country the new iPhones would be taking.\n\nThe parallel, or grey, imports scheme, endorsed by the Russian government for brands that exited Russia since the invasion, keeps the goods of companies that sought to leave Russia available and shows the challenge firms face in controlling supply chains when exiting a market.\n\nM.Video said prices would start at 112,999 roubles ($1,225) for the 128GB iPhone 16, over $400 more expensive than the U.S. price of $799. The 1TB iPhone Pro Max was available for pre-order in Russia for 249,999 roubles ($2,710), compared to the U.S. price of $1,599.\n\nMTS prices were marginally higher than M.Video's and said it required a 25,000-rouble deposit for pre-orders.\n\nWestern goods and technology remain popular in Russia, a potential vulnerability that Moscow wants to reduce with domestic production.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Kremlin has told officials to stop using iPhones, saying that Western intelligence agencies have compromised them using surveillance software. Apple has denied those claims.\n\n($1 = 92.2500 roubles)\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘The Weekend’s Pre-orders For The New iPhone 16 Were Anemic’ According to Firms",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Stock Picks You Can’t Ignore.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's top stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current divide between tech stocks and other sectors, highlighting their tendency to move in opposite directions. For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn’t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ—with all that tech in it—dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\n\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can’t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it’s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\n\"It’s because there’s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it’s not about the news, it’s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it’s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there’s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\n\nMarket Shake-Up: Clear Winners and Losers Amid Fed's Critical Rate Decision\n\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed’s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers—not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\n\nNow, you know me, I try to refrain from this parlor game of guessing the Fed's next move based on the strength of the economy. Last week, when *The Wall Street Journal* indicated the Fed may actually be leaning toward 50 basis points, we saw this great migration into cyclicals, especially anything related to housing. Of course, last week, there was just enough good news to propel the entire market, which is why it was the best week of the year.\n\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that’s how this market seems to be trading. It’s a big reason why I’m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn’t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It’s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\n\nJim Cramer's Definition of ABT: \"Anything But Tech\"\n\nJim Cramer noted that Monday’s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It’s crazy—healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that’s not what’s happening because it’s *ABT*. No, I’m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means “anything but tech,” and that’s what today’s market was about.\n\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what’s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market’s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\n\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer explained that money flowed out of stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after reports from several firms suggested weak pre-orders for the new iPhone 16. This news led to a significant sell-off in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) related stocks.\n\n\"The money poured out of stocks like Apple on word from a few firms that the weekend's pre-orders for the new iPhone 16 were anemic (more on that later). All you need to know is that it caused an eruption of selling in anything connected to Apple.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) presents a strong investment case due to several key factors. The recent introduction of the iPhone 16, which includes advanced AI features, is expected to spark a major upgrade cycle, with analysts forecasting sales of up to 240 million units due to high pent-up demand.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s focus on integrating AI across its entire product range, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs, aims to enhance user experiences and create new revenue opportunities. Combined with impressive growth in its services sector and strong profit margins, these factors contribute to a favorable long-term outlook for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), with analysts predicting a potential price increase of about 25%.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance.\n\nOur Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period. This quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally.\n\nThe company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago...\" (Click here to read more)\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock\n\nA technician in a pristine lab, focused on designing a new semiconductor chip.\n\nARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nLast Monday, Jim Cramer recommended buying stocks of\n\nMicron Technology, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:MU),\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMD), and ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH), noting that the semiconductor sector had experienced an extreme sell-off, making these stocks likely candidates for a rebound. Since then, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH), a major player in semiconductor design, saw a notable 10% increase, despite a recent 6% drop due to reports of weak orders for new iPhones, which use ARM’s chip architecture.\n\nThis dip does not concern Cramer much, especially considering ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH)'s stock has surged nearly 175% since its public debut about a year ago. The key question now is whether ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) can continue this upward momentum.\n\n\"Last Monday, I told you it was time to buy the stocks of Micron, AMD, and ARM Holdings because the semiconductor sell-off had gotten too extreme, and these three seemed ripe for a bounce. Since then, ARM Holdings, the semiconductor design colossus, has rallied about 10%, even with today's brutal 6% decline on reports of weak orders for new iPhones, which contain their chip architecture. But I don't mind the pullback, given that ARM's stock is up almost 175% since it went public roughly a year ago. The question is, can it keep running?\"\n\nARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) is a strong investment opportunity due to its leading position in the semiconductor industry, especially in the growing edge AI and mobile technology markets. Recently named Morgan Stanley's top large-cap pick, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) is set for significant growth, particularly with its energy-efficient AI processing technology. Its v9 architecture is widely adopted, including in devices like the iPhone 16, which uses ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) chips for AI functions. This widespread use is expected to boost ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH)'s royalties and revenue in the coming years.\n\nIn its Q1 FY25 earnings report, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) showed a 39% increase in revenue from the previous year, driven by strong performance in mobile and automotive segments. Morgan Stanley forecasts a 35% annual growth rate for ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH)’s mobile business from FY24 to FY27, due to rising demand for AI chips and custom silicon.\n\nWith a robust licensing and royalty model, including partnerships with major companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARMH) is well-positioned for long-term success. Despite some short-term economic uncertainties, its advancements in AI and custom chip solutions support a positive outlook for the future.\n\nOverall ARMH ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of ARMH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARMH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\n\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company recently launched the latest models of the iPhone with AI features as it seeks to capitalize on growing AI interest in the smartphone business. However, with pre-orders for the new phones down from last year and Chinese firms offering the new models at a discount due to soft demand, it seems like Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that come preloaded on the new iPhones, have not been enough to revive the slowing demand for the Apple phones. Apple Intelligence will be available on new devices in English later this year, with support for other languages coming next year.\n\nDemand for new Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones have slowed in China amid increased competition in the Chinese market, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. Apple is competing with Chinese firms like Huawei for phone supremacy. Last week, Huawei unveiled a Z-shaped trifold phone Mate XT just a few hours after Apple launched the iPhone 16 models. The phone shipments for the former have soared 41% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, as those for the latter dipped by about two percentage points in the same period.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Last month saw volatility as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its quarterly print and more.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), representing the semiconductor industry, have lost ~7% in the last 30 days. Now, let’s run down the events for Taiwan Semiconductor since Nvidia released its quarterly print.\n\nOn August 28, Nvidia reported second-quarter topline growth of 122% to $30.04 billion, quashing the analyst consensus of $28.68 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Intel Looks To Restructure Foundry Business, Bags Major US Deal and Government Grants\n\nThe company projected third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion—$33.15 billion, versus the consensus of $31.77 billion.\n\nStill, the stock dropped by 6% in after-hours trading, sending semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), down as the print failed to impress the Street.\n\nThe semiconductor sector selloff continued in September, with U.S.-China geopolitical tensions intensifying due to the Western counterpart’s artificial intelligence technology embargo on the Asian counterpart.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor remained invested in solidifying its moat by localizing neon gas production, a key chipmaking material disrupted by the Ukraine war, and fast-tracking the development of silicon photonics to address the energy and data transmission speeds needed by AI computing.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor projected a 50% growth in AI accelerators at the Semicon Taiwan industry forum in Taipei despite concerns over the sustainability of the AI frenzy, which is sending jitters across the market. Broadcom Inc’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly print and guidance did little to contain the semiconductor selloff.\n\nOn the brighter side, reports indicated that the contract chipmaker’s production yield at the Arizona facility is at par with its Taiwan facilities.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor reported 33% topline growth in August 2024, testimony to the smartphone market recovery and continued demand for Nvidia AI chips. Analysts expect third-quarter revenue growth of 37%.\n\nSome of Taiwan Semiconductors key September wins included a Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google smartphone deal involving Pixel 10 and Pixel 11 chips and Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) A16 chip at its Arizona Fab.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is up over 90% in the last 12 months as it led the global foundry market, commanding a 62% share in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock closed at $167.28 on Wednesday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "While Apple Abandoned Its Car Project After Pouring $1B Into It, Its Key Supplier Foxconn Is Now Collaborating With Sharp On An EV Prototype\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nSharp has revealed an innovative electric vehicle prototype, the LDK+, developed in collaboration with its parent company, Foxconn. The announcement was made on Tuesday during Sharp Tech-Day in Tokyo.\n\nWhat Happened: The LDK+ concept car integrates the functionality of a traditional vehicle with a room-like interior, aiming to provide a new style of mobility. Sharp's Chief Technical Officer, Mototaka Taneya, emphasized the growing importance of cars as personal spaces, especially with the advent of autonomous driving technology, Nikkei Asia reported on Wednesday.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Get ‘em while you can — investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\n\nSharp's design allows the vehicle's interior to be used effectively even when parked, transforming it into a personal space for work or leisure. Features include a rotatable rear seat, a Sharp LCD display, and windows that can turn opaque for privacy. The car also uses AI to adjust air conditioning and lighting based on user preferences.\n\nThe LDK+ is built on an EV platform developed by Foxconn, which has been focusing on the EV market. Foxconn's Chief Strategy Officer for EVs, Jun Seki, highlighted the cost-efficiency of this modular approach, allowing companies to create unique models without heavy investments.\n\nSharp's entry into the EV market comes amid industry challenges, with growth slowing and automakers adjusting their strategies. Despite these hurdles, Seki expressed optimism about the future of EVs, predicting significant market growth by 2027.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nWhy It Matters: The collaboration between Foxconn and Sharp represents a significant step in the evolving electric vehicle market. Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has been making strategic moves to diversify its portfolio and enter the EV sector, while Apple itself abandoned its EV project after pouring over a billion dollars into it in February. In May 2022, Foxconn's chairman, Liu Young-way, expressed confidence in overcoming supply chain challenges and aimed to become the first EV maker not affected by material shortages. This ambition aligns with their broader strategy to compete with established EV manufacturers like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO).\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Foxconn's recent approval to invest $246 million in Northern Vietnam for manufacturing EV parts underscores their commitment to this market. The investment will focus on producing EV chargers and components, starting in January 2025. This move is expected to enhance Foxconn's production capabilities and support its goal of becoming a key player in the EV industry.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent days following reports that the pre-orders for the much-awaited iPhone 16 series have been below analyst expectations and are down more than 10% compared to pre-orders for the previous version of the phone. According to reports, 37 million units of the new iPhone have been ordered, and one of the main reasons behind the slowdown in orders has been the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro. In the Pro version of the new iPhone, Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered features of the new Apple software, are not available at launch. China competition has also impacted iPhone sales.\n\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wall Street analysts have bullish views. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The company recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. The cloud departments of these tech giants are leading these investments.\n\nWells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone Upgrade Cycle: Will AI Boost Sales?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhile everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.\n\nAronov said cutting rates would “loosen” the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be “elusive” because fiscal spending will continue to rise.\n\nAI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle.\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them.\n\nWith each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Among AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nErik Woodring, Morgan Stanley equity research executive director, said while talking to CNBC that he believes we are entering a “seasonal period” of relative underperformance for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nWoodring said that the stock underperformance of Apple after the latest iPhone event was a result of a “relatively measured, slow and staggered rollout” of the key feature, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\n\nThe analyst said in the first few days of the event, data regarding pre-orders is very “noisy” and lead times data points come in from the supply and demand side.\n\nThe analyst said that lead times are important on a per-model basis. He said day-one lead times are a bit lower than past cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event went more or less as expected and all eyes are now on pre-order data and actual numbers on the new iPhone. A survey by US AlphaWise showed about 60% of customers planning to upgrade their iPhone said Apple Intelligence is a key part of the rationale behind the upgrade.\n\nAlmost all bull cases around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are based on the assumption that millions of people would upgrade their iPhones mainly due to AI. However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AAPL stock that is more promising than AI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "JPMorgan Reportedly in Talks With Apple for Credit Card Partnership",
        "content": "JPMorgan JPM is in discussions with Apple Inc. AAPL regarding a credit card partnership to replace Goldman Sachs GS. This was first reported by Wall Street Journal, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nWhat Led to JPM’s Negotiations?\n\nIn 2019, Goldman partnered with Apple as it entered into the credit card space to issue Apple credit cards. However, it began pulling back last year due to significant losses in its consumer division.\r\n \r\nIn early 2023, GS informed Apple of its intention to offload the partnership due to financial strains and in November, Apple reportedly proposed an exit from its credit card contract within the next 12 to 15 months. This paved the way for potential new partners to take over the Apple credit card program.\r\n\r\nIn December 2023, JPM was reportedly being considered a natural successor to take over the Apple credit card program given the existing relationship between the two entities. The two entities already had ties via Apple Pay, and JPMorgan was one of the largest partners for transactions at Apple retail outlets.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, AAPL and JPMorgan initiated discussions to consider the possibility of the bank becoming the new issuer of the Apple Card.\n\nJPMorgan’s Current Status in Negotiations\n\nAs reported by Wall Street Journal, the discussions have advanced in recent weeks, However, there’s no certainty that an agreement will be formed.\r\n\r\nJPM is negotiating for better terms, as it seeks to pay less than the full value for roughly $17 billion outstanding balances in the Apple Card program due to higher losses on the cards. Sources close to Goldman contended that higher-than-average delinquencies and defaults on the Apple Card portfolio were majorly owed to the new user accounts.\r\n\r\nApple and Goldman offered cards to customers with weak credit scores in an attempt to boost their revenues, which resulted in increased subprime exposure and terms that could be costly for any issuer. This has further complicated the negotiations.\r\n\r\nAlso, JPM is in talks regarding amendments to some parts of the program, which includes Apple’s calendar-based billing feature, which means that cardholders receive statements at the beginning of the month instead of staggered ones dispersed across the period. This feature, while appealing to customers, leads to a huge number of calls for the service personnel at the same time each month.\r\n\r\nThese efforts align with JPM’s aim to grow its presence in diverse sectors and strengthen its market share. Last week, it was reported that the company seeks to increase its corporate banking presence in the Swiss markets by utilizing its blockchain technology. It is currently in discussions with potential clients in Switzerland as the bank projects significant growth in its Swiss corporate banking division over the next three to five years. Similarly, earlier this month, JPM set up a private banking team in Dubai to offer wealth management services. This July, the company stated that it aims to capture 15% of the nation’s consumer deposits.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPM’s Zacks Rank & Price Performance\n\nYear to date, shares of JPMorgan have gained 23% compared with the industry’s 17.1% growth.

        "title": "Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?",
        "content": "Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a household name, and for good reason. That little blue-and-gold card has become a global symbol of convenience, tucked away in wallets around the world, supported by strong financials, a dominant market position and strategic investments in emerging technologies like blockchain and digital wallets. However, with its stock trading at a premium price-earnings ratio above 30 and facing rising competition from fintech disruptors like Block (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), the stock seems to be fairly valued and is a hold for me at current levels.\n\nWhile the company's strong financials and market position make it an attractive long-term investment, in the short term, the premium valuation limits upside potential.\n\nOverview of recent performance\n\nThe stock has been quite stable in recent months, consistently closing around $276.37. Up around 13.31% year to date, this is a fairly good performance, especially after adjusting for the economic headwinds consumers have had to endure. Although existing problems such as inflationary pressures and high interest rates continued to affect consumers' demand, transaction volumes as well as revenues have remained constant and even improved for Visa. This goes a long way in explaining its capacity to deliver above-average results.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Visa disclosed a net revenue of $8.90 billion, up 9.60% from the same period last year, while its net income rose by 17.20% to $4.87 billion. These robust numbers indicated the company is able to achieve steady growth no matter how hard the going gets; the result of its market leadership coupled with operational excellence. That being said, the economic environment remains rather volatile.\n\nRevenue and net income growth\n\nThe following chart shows a steady rise in Visa's revenue and net income over the first three quarters of 2024. Revenue increased from $8.10 billion in the first quarter to $8.90 billion by the third quarter. Net income also followed an upward path, growing from $4.16 billion to $4.87 billion over the same period. Although this growth is not explosive, it highlights Visa's ability to maintain solid, reliable performance even in a challenging economic environment. Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?\n\nSo why the wobble? Let's look a little closer.\n\nWhat's moving the needle? A look behind the numbers\n\nVisa's premium valuation is well justified by its exceptional growth potential, market leadership and consistent financial performance. Trading at a price-earnings ratio of 30.20above the broader market averagethe stock commands a higher valuation, but for good reason. Its ability to steadily increase both revenue and profits, despite global economic challenges, is a testament to its resilience. This premium reflects investors' confidence in Visa's future dominance in the payments space, as the company continues to innovate and expand internationally.\n\nTo illustrate how Visa's valuation stands compared to the market, consider the following chart comparing its price-earnings ratio against the market average. Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?\n\nVisa's elevated earnings multiple suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for its potential growth, but it also highlights the vulnerability to market corrections if the company doesn't meet its growth expectations. Now, let's dig deeper.\n\nThere is also its PEG ratio of 2.10. Some may consider this metric, which takes earnings growth into consideration, to be higher than desirable, but it is more a product of the marketplace's belief in Visa's capacity to maintain rapid growth. This is why investors are willing to pay a premium to enjoy the future expansion of Visa's digital payments, and its international market expansion. This PEG ratio indicates that this company's performance is not only rock-steady but contains a growth component as well.\n\nFurther, Visa has an enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 22 that is higher than that of its industry peers, which are estimated to be between 15 and 18 times, indicating the efficiency of its operations and its capacity to produce solid cash flows. The company has maintained high operating margins and its current standing at 66.70% with almost $13 billion in cash allows it to participate in strategic acquisitions and investments. This goes some way toward explaining its higher EV/Ebitda ratio because Visa has remained a brilliant allocator of capital.\n\nThe price-sales ratio of 18.40 is also a testament to the market's appreciation of the fact Visa has been translating its robust sales figures to even better profits. Nonetheless, this rate is way above the sector average.\n\nLastly, Visa's free cash flow yield of 3.50%, while slightly below the industry average, underscores its consistent ability to generate substantial cash flows. With $14.42 billion in free cash flow over the past nine months, the comany is well-positioned to continue reinvesting in future growth and rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The cash flow, combined with a low payout ratio of 21.90%, suggests there's ample room for dividend growth, which makes it an attractive choice for long-term investors seeking both capital appreciation and income.\n\nWhere does Visa go from here?\n\nSo where does Visa go from here? Despite the challenges, the company isn't just sitting back. It is pushing hard into digital payments and expanding in international markets, where there's still plenty of room for growth. For example, its international transaction revenue for the nine months ended June 30 hit $15.40 billion, up from $13.50 billion the previous year. That's a solid 14.10% increase, showing it is successfully leveraging its global network.\n\nHowever, Visa's focus is not limited to analogue transactions, though that is where it started from. It is embracing new trends in payments solutions such as decentralized wallets and blockchain to be on track with the ever-evolving market. For example, Visa Direct has become a real-time payment mechanism with a rather large presence. The company has further ventured into peer-to-peer transactions through integration with other digital wallet providers such as PayPal and Venmo. These affiliations help it address the issue of capturing the market of young people of the technological era, where cashless transactions are gradually dominating.\n\nBlockchain technology is also on the radar at Visa, especially when it comes to international remittances. Earlier this year, it moved to stablecoin settlements using USDC on the Ethereum network in partnership with Circle. This is a rather progressive approach that effectively places Visa at the heart of decentralized finance. One of the biggest benefits of using blockchain is time and cost savings in international payments, which can be a powerful tool to increase revenue in international markets.\n\nChallenges\n\nBut before you start thinking Visa is invincible, let's talk about a few of the challenges it is facing.\n\nFirst, the company is tangled up in a few legal battles over interchange fees and other practices, which could cost it bigboth in terms of dollars and reputation. As of June 30, it has set aside $1.69 billion for litigation. That's not pocket change, even for Visa.\n\nThen there's competition. The payments space is crowded, and it's getting more crowded every day with fintech startups and other established players like Block and PayPal gaining market share, while tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are pushing hard with Apple Pay and Google Pay, respectively. These companies are offering innovative, often cheaper, payment solutions that could potentially erode Visa's market dominance\n\nAnd finally, there's the whole priced for perfection thing. With a price-earnings ratio north of 30, investors are expecting Visa to keep hitting it out of the park. Any slip-upwhether it's a missed earnings target or a macroeconomic shockcould send the stock tumbling.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nVisa is still a powerhouse with a lot going for itstrong financials, a dominant market position and operating in a high barrier of entry market with a track record of smart investments in digital wallets and blockchain. However, its premium valuation means investors are paying for high growth expectations. For those reasons, I am a hold on the stock currently.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its dominance in the online search market.\n\nThe lawsuit – valued at up to 7 billion pounds ($9.3 billion) – is the latest case focusing on the business practices of Google, which is currently facing a major antitrust trial in the United States over its online advertising business.\n\nIt is also one of several multibillion-pound cases to have been filed at Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal in recent years, including a similar case against Google for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market.\n\nConsumer rights campaigner and the lawsuit's class representative Nikki Stopford argues Google's dominance allows it to increase businesses' costs for search advertising services which are then passed on to consumers.\n\nPart of the lawsuit relies on the more than 4-billion-euro ($4.5 billion) fine levied on Google by the European Commission in 2018 for imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices, a decision being appealed by the tech company.\n\nStopford's lawyers also argue Google reached an anticompetitive deal with Apple to make it the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser in exchange for a share of Google's mobile search ad revenues.\n\nThe lawyers asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case to proceed towards a trial, a very early step in any mass lawsuit. Google, however, says the case is seriously flawed.\n\n\"The suggestion that consumers have been harmed by the Google conducts at issue is strongly rejected,\" Google's lawyer Meredith Pickford said in court documents.\n\nPickford added that the European Commission's findings were simply \"technical complaints about the particular form by which Google promoted its products\".\n\nHe also said that Google's default search engine agreement with Apple was \"in principle perfectly lawful\". Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n($1 = 0.8994 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Catarina Demony and Mark Potter)",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Best Long-Term Stock to Buy According To Warren Buffett",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.\n\nWarren Buffett, the most famous investor on Wall Street, needs no introduction, having generated billions of dollars for himself and investors for decades. Throughout his investment career that began in 1965, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ has averaged annual returns of 19.8%, trumping a gain of 9.9% for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nThe market-beating performance has propelled Buffett to the top of the charts as one of Wall Street’s most revered and followed investors. His investment portfolio is always tracked as investors scan for potential market opportunities.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now and 10 Best Counter Cyclical and Defensive Stocks to Invest In.\n\nLikewise, Buffett is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street’s history, having accumulated a fortune of $138 billion. His total assets might have been significantly higher if he hadn’t donated large sums to different charitable causes.\n\nMarket participants have always applauded his disciplined approach, which entails a long-term perspective. His investment firm has become the latest company to cross the $1 trillion mark on market cap, underlining Buffett’s impressive stock-picking skills. According to Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research, the $1 trillion milestone is a testament to Buffet’s investment firm’s financial strength and franchise value.\n\nBuffett’s investment strategy has remained constant throughout his career, focusing on the concept of value investing. The strategy focuses on identifying companies that are undervalued but have the potential to increase in value over time. Buffett seeks out companies with a lasting edge over competitors, like a well-established brand, high barriers to entry, and a large and loyal customer base, and he buys into them at a price that ensures a safety margin.\n\nLikewise, the billionaire investor is well-known for his cautious stance on investing in high-risk, high-reward sectors like technology. Instead, he prefers to invest in more stable sectors such as retail, insurance, and finance. He is recognized for his commitment to long-term investments, holding onto companies for extended periods, and steering clear of frequent trading. This strategy enables him to benefit from the compound interest effect and allows the companies he invests in to mature and produce significant profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett’s cautious approach is evidenced by the fact that his investment firm had over $180 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter. The cash reserves were expected to swell to over $270 billion as of the end of June.\n\nThe cash reserves have been building up as the billionaire investor only invests in finding attractive deals with eye-popping returns. In a 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett reiterated he did not see the possibility of eye-popping performance.\n\nBuffett has consistently included dividend stocks in his portfolio, which is a strategy that has effectively generated consistent passive income. This year alone, his investments are projected to generate around $6 billion in dividend earnings.\n\nNevertheless, Buffett has also been in defensive mode in recent months, opting to reduce stakes in some companies. He has trimmed holdings by up to half in some tech giants, concerned by valuations getting out of hand after a year of gains fuelled by the artificial intelligence frenzy.\n\nWhile valuations have gotten out of hand going by the blockbuster gains over the past year, there are still opportunities to unlock. With the US Federal Reserve poised to end its monetary easing spree with a cut of interest rates, equity is poised to receive a significant boost.\n\nThe best long-term stocks to buy, according to Warren Buffett, are companies well poised to benefit from interest rates dropping. Low interest rates make it easier for companies to access cheap capital to accelerate their operations, generating more shareholder value.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our selection of the best long-term stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett, we began by analyzing Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio and chose to highlight the stock holdings that have remained within the portfolio for at least 5 years. Next, we assessed the number of hedge fund investors associated with each stock, as of the end of the second quarter of this year. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order based on the value of Warren Buffett stakes in the companies.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett’s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Latest Investment Stake: $84.25 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best long-term stocks to buy, according to Warren Buffett, a consumer tech giant. The company is engaged in developing and selling an array of devices, including iPhones, iPads, and Mac’s wearables, among others.\n\nThe company’s competitive edge stems from its game-changing devices and solutions that have propelled it to a three trillion dollar empire. Recently, the company unveiled the iPhone 16, a new device expected to reinvigorate growth in its slowing iPhone business. The company is also betting on artificial intelligence as it aims to strengthen its product pipeline to attract more sales.\n\nAnalysts have touted the new iPhone as a product that could be the most successful iPhone yet, likely to generate more value. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s revenue growth in the past year, up to the third quarter of 2024, has been relatively slow, increasing by just 0.43%. However, there was a significant jump in earnings during the third quarter of 2024, with a notable quarterly increase of 4.87%. This suggests a consistent financial path, though, with a moderate pace of growth.\n\nAfter rallying for the better part of the year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not necessarily cheap, as it trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 29. Nevertheless, the premium valuation is expected of a three trillion dollar company that is poised to generate significant value.\n\nApple remains Buffett’s biggest holdings despite downsizing his stakes by up to 56% in the first two quarters of the year. The oracle of Omaha sold roughly 510 million shares in  the tech  giant. Nevertheless the company still accounts for about 40% of the portfolio.\n\nIt remains one of Buffett’s longest investments owing to the fact that it pays a dividend with a yield of 0.45%. Additionally, the company returns value through stock buybacks. By June 2024 end, 184 out of the 912 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey were the firm’s investors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, whose $84.25 billion stake also makes the stock the biggest in Berkshire’s portfolio.\n\nHere is what Mar Vista Focus strategy said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "If You Bought 1 Share of Apple Stock at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has moved back into the top spot as the largest company in the world by market cap. It's gone through some stunning ups and downs, but if you'd bought shares at the initial public offering (IPO) back in 1980 and held on, you'd have a lot more shares, and a lot of money. Let's see just how much.\n\nHolding for the long term\n\nApple went public in December 1980 at $22 per share. Like pretty much any stock over a nearly 45-year period, Apple stock has climbed and crashed several times. For example, it lost 21% of its value between 1989 and 1996 -- a long period for an investor to hold on to a stock that's losing. But if you did, you'd have quite a windfall today.\n\nSince that time, Apple has developed an incredible tech platform with a strong moat in its differentiated systems and applications. It has a strong, loyal fan base that only buys Apple products and consistently moves up to new drops and launches. Just this week Apple released its latest software update, iOS18, with a swarm of new upgrades and features. It's also investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive in the tech race.\n\nThat's why Apple stock has skyrocketed over time and gone through five stock splits: three 2-for-1 stock splits in 1987, 2000, and 2005; a 7-for-1 split in 2014; and a 4-for-1 split in 2020. Each IPO share would have been worth $0.10 split adjusted, and you'd own 224 shares today. At today's prices, that's worth $48,455.\n\nIn short, the stock has appreciated more than 2,200 times since its IPO. For further perspective, if you had instead invested $1,000 in the stock at its IPO, your investment would've been worth $2.2 million today, excluding the dividends that were paid to you over the years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Insiders At Apple Sold US$82m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nApple Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Senior VP, Katherine Adams, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$23m worth of shares at a price of US$189 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$217, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of Katherine Adams's holding.\n\nInsiders in Apple didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Apple Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Apple. In total, insiders sold US$24m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Apple insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$2.0b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Apple Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Apple is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious.

        "title": "These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 blue chip stocks. The index has returned 10% year to date, but companies making big splashes in artificial intelligence (AI) could fare much better over the next year and beyond.\n\nHere are two Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has delivered wealth-building returns for shareholders over the last few decades, and it's currently up 22% in 2024. Amazon still has plenty of growth opportunities in retail and enterprise cloud services to fuel the stock higher.\n\nAmazon's expanding same-day delivery and growing selection of items will be important advantages in capturing a growing share of the global e-commerce market. Data and intelligence platform Statista predicts that online retail spending will surpass $8 trillion by 2027.\n\nWhat makes the stock particularly attractive right now is the company's improving profit margin. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter over the year-ago quarter, and there are still several opportunities to improve retail margins further, including decreasing transportation costs by getting closer to customers with more same-day delivery facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's cloud service business, which generates two-thirds of the company's operating income, is showing even greater growth potential. Companies are migrating their data from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services to take advantage of tools like Amazon Bedrock, which helps companies build their own AI applications. Amazon also offers custom AI chips that offer better price performance than higher-priced chips from top hardware supplier Nvidia. These are a few of the reasons why AWS' revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to 19% over the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe opportunities in online commerce and cloud services are great reasons to consider buying Amazon shares in 2024. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at double-digit rates in the coming years, and that points to more new highs for the stock.\n\n2. Apple\n\nA significant driver of economic growth will be the AI market. AI software will simplify tasks and help people find what they need a lot faster, which could lead to significant increases in productivity. There's no consumer brand that is better positioned to benefit from this trend than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe iPhone is an essential device that people check as soon as they wake up in the morning. With over 2.2 billion active devices, Apple will be the face of AI for millions, which is why the stock is up this year heading into the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Intelligence will begin rolling out to U.S. users as a free update in the next month. The opportunity for Apple is that Apple Intelligence requires devices with the more recent M1 and later-generation processors. This provides a natural incentive for users to upgrade to the new iPhone 16.\n\nCitigroup's internal research shows that customers pre-ordering the new iPhones are opting to go for the premium Pro Max model. This bodes well for Apple's margins, which have already been moving higher in recent years from growth in paid subscriptions and other offerings as part of its services segment.\n\nIDC expects smartphone shipments with generative AI features to grow 364% in 2024 to 234 million. By 2028, that figure is expected to reach 912 million. Apple Intelligence will help the company further distinguish its brand, which could lead to market share gains, growth in its installed base of devices, and more demand for high-margin services.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple's earnings to increase by 17% in fiscal 2024 (ending in September) and 11% next year. Apple should be able to sustain double-digit earnings growth for several more years and deliver superior returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "53% of Warren Buffett's $309 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 3 Unstoppable Stocks",
        "content": "For more than a half-century, mirroring Warren Buffett's investment activity has made investors richer. Since ascending to the CEO chair at Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), the aptly named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,400,000%, as of the closing bell on Sept. 13!\n\nWhat's particularly great about Warren Buffett's investing philosophy is that he's more than willing to share the traits he looks for in so-called \"wonderful companies.\" The characteristics Buffett craves are sustainable moats/competitive advantages, strong management teams, and time-tested businesses that often have exceptional capital-return programs. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut the one factor that doesn't get nearly enough credit for Berkshire Hathaway's long-term outperformance is the Oracle of Omaha's penchant for portfolio concentration. Even though Buffett is currently overseeing a 43-stock, $309 billion investment portfolio (not including exchange-traded funds), the lion's share of his company's invested capital has been put to work in his best ideas.\n\nOut of Berkshire's $309 billion of invested assets, roughly 53% can be traced to just three unstoppable stocks.\n\nApple: $89 billion (28.8% of invested assets)\n\nDespite Buffett being a net-seller of more than 500 million shares of tech goliath Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) over the last three quarters, the 400 million shares of Wall Street's largest publicly traded company still owned by Berkshire Hathaway equates to almost 29% of invested assets.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett suggested that corporate tax rates were liable to increase in the future, and hinted at this thesis as his reasoning for selling a significant stake in Apple. In other words, he believes investors will, over time, appreciate locking in outsized unrealized gains in Apple at a favorably low tax rate.\n\nBut make no mistake about it, the Oracle of Omaha still believes Apple is a fantastic business and has plenty of faith in its CEO Tim Cook.\n\nApple is easily one of the most-recognized and strongest brands in the world. Minimal marketing is needed when consumers line up in front of its stores, or rush to their laptops or smartphones to place pre-orders, for the company's latest devices.\n\nThe thing investors should know about Apple is that it's much more than just a company that develops physical products. Although the iPhone is still its top revenue driver, Tim Cook has been overseeing a multiyear shift toward subscription services. A subscription-focused platform should produce higher margins, improve customer loyalty even more, and smooth out the revenue hills and valleys often observed during major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since the start of 2013, Apple has bought back approximately $700 billion worth of its common stock and reduced its outstanding share count by 42.2%. This has incrementally increased Berkshire Hathaway's ownership stake in Apple, as well as provided a hearty lift to Apple's earnings per share. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $39.3 billion (12.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe second-largest holding in the $309 billion portfolio the Oracle of Omaha oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services goliath American Express(NYSE: AXP). AmEx is Berkshire's second longest-tenured holding (since 1991).\n\nThe reason Warren Buffett tends to gravitate to financials (his favorite sector) is because they're cyclical. Even though Buffett is well aware that recessions are a normal part of the economic cycle, he wisely understands that downturns resolve quickly. Three-quarters of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II failed to endure for 12 months. Comparatively, two periods of growth surpassed the decade mark, with most expansions sticking around for multiple years.\n\nAmerican Express is a company that's built to thrive during disproportionately long periods of growth.\n\nFurthermore, AmEx benefits from both sides of the transaction aisle. It's the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., which means it's generating predictable fees from merchants when facilitating payments. But it's also a lender. The personal and business credit cards AmEx issues allow it to collect annual fees and generate interest income. Being able to double-dip on both sides of a transaction has helped AmEx grow into the behemoth it is today.\n\nAnother key factor for American Express has been its ability to court high-earning clientele. Compared to the average-earning consumer, high earners are less likely to demonstrably alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills during economic disruptions. On paper at least, AmEx appears better suited than most lenders to navigate a U.S. recession.\n\nWith Berkshire's cost-basis in AmEx an ultra-low $8.49 per share, it should be noted that American Express's base annual payout of $2.80 per share equates to an annual yield on cost of 33% for Buffett's company. In short, Buffett is seeing his initial investment in AmEx double about every three years on dividend income alone.\n\nBank of America: $33.2 billion (10.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe third-largest holding that, in addition to Apple and American Express, collectively accounts for about 53% of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), which is better-known as \"BofA.\"\n\nThis longtime top holding for Berkshire Hathaway has been in the spotlight of late. Thanks to required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we know that Buffett has sold a grand total of almost 174 million shares of BofA in 27 of the last 39 trading sessions, dating back to July 17.\n\nThis selling activity could be completely benign or potentially worrisome. For instance, tax-related selling (similar to the reasoning given for ringing the register on shares of Apple) wouldn't be much of a concern. However, Buffett may also be building a mammoth cash position at his company because he believes the stock market is historically pricey.\n\nThe primary lure to bank stocks, as discussed earlier, is that they're cyclical. Non-linear economic cycles allow banks to grow their loan portfolios over time and generate progressively higher fees and interest income.\n\nBank of America just happens to be the most interest-sensitive of America's largest banks by assets. The 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate from March 2022 through the present has lifted its net interest income by billions of dollars every quarter. But with the Fed expected to kick off a rate-easing cycle this week, there remains a distinct possibility that BofA's bottom line could be harmed more than any other bank stock for the foreseeable future.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that Berkshire's stake in Bank of America has fallen to 11.1% of BofA's outstanding shares. If this stake should dip below 10%, the Oracle of Omaha will no longer be required to lift the hood on every transaction. Instead, investors will have to wait until quarterly 13Fs are filed to get the full details of what he and his investment team have been up to.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which Tech Stock Is Better: Apple or Microsoft?",
        "content": "In this article, I evaluate two leading technology stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), to determine which is the better investment. In preview, I have a neutral view of Apple and a bullish outlook on Microsoft.\n\nApple is known for its popular consumer electronics such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and MacBook computer. The company also provides digital content via its App Store, Apple TV, and the Apple Card payment service. Microsoft is known for the Windows personal computer (PC) operating system, its Office 365 software suite, the Xbox video game console, and its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nAAPL stock has risen 13% year-to-date and is up 22% over the last year. Microsoft’s share price has gained 15% year-to-date and is up 32% over the past 12 months. These share price performances make Apple and Microsoft the laggards of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” technology stocks, with only Tesla (TSLA) performing worse. AAPL and MSFT stocks have also underperformed the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index that is up nearly 20% this year.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nThe valuation of Apple stock has a lot to do with my neutral view. Currently, AAPL is trading at 32 times future earnings estimates, which is less than the average price/earnings ratio of 44 among technology stocks. MSFT is also trading at a higher multiple of 36 times future earnings expectations. Additionally, Apple’s stock has been largely trading sideways since June of this year. Because of this, a neutral view of the stock seems appropriate.\n\nThere are also concerns about iPhone sales to consider. When the company launched the iPhone 16 earlier in September, AAPL stock jumped. However, there have been reports about weak sales immediately following the newest iPhone’s public unveiling. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that iPhone 16 demand is weak, dropping 12% compared to last year’s iPhone 15 launch.\n\nKuo and other analysts have also expressed disappointment with the lack of new features on the iPhone 16. One of the most anticipated features, the company’s AI application known as “Apple Intelligence,” won’t launch until October of this year and is only in a beta format. Of course, Apple remains a strong company overall, and the current iPhone slump is likely temporary. However, patient investors might be able to buy the stock at a more attractive share price in the coming weeks if iPhone 16 sales disappoint.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy?\n\nApple has a consensus rating of Moderate Buy among 32 Wall Street analysts. There are currently 23 Buy ratings, eight Hold ratings, and one Sell recommendation assigned to the stock. At $249.46, the average Apple stock price target implies upside potential of 15.39%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more analyst ratings on AAPL stock\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nThere are many reasons to be bullish on MSFT stock. Like Apple, Microsoft is trading at a discount to the technology sector. Microsoft’s stock has been in decline in recent months, falling 7% since early July. Some of that decline has been reversed on news that the company is raising its dividend by 10% and has approved a new $60 billion stock buyback program, boosting shareholder returns in the process. The company raised its dividend from $0.75 to $0.83 per share, payable on Dec. 12 of this year.\n\nMicrosoft also continues to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, capturing market share in both fast-growing segments. Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform continues to grow at a brisk clip and is more all-encompassing than Apple’s upcoming AI features for the iPhone.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy or Sell?\n\nMicrosoft has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on the views of 30 Wall Street analysts. This is comprised of 29 Buy and one Hold rating on the company’s stock. No Sell ratings have been assigned over the last three months. At $501.15, the average price target on Microsoft stock implies upside potential of 16.16%.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on MSFT stock\n\nConclusion\n\nApple and Microsoft could be long-term additions to any portfolio. However, Microsoft is preferred based on the company’s leadership role in AI and future growth potential. The fact that the company raised its dividend payout to shareholders and initiated a $60 billion share repurchase program are other reasons to like MSFT stock. Apple, on the other hand, is struggling with weak iPhone demand and to clarify its AI strategy. As such, I remain bullish on MSFT stock and neutral on AAPL stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): A Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports indicate that the authorities in Ireland have initiated a cross-border inquiry into an AI model marketed by Google. The data protection department in Ireland has said that it will review whether Google complied with EU obligations before processing personal data of EU users to help develop the foundational AI model named Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2). The Irish government has previously conducted such inquiries against social media platform X as well.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has received bullish calls from Wall Street. Stifel analyst Mark Kelley raised the price target on the stock to $199 from $196 and kept a Buy rating, detailing that the company reported revenue and operating income ahead of expectations with continued strength in Search and a slight beat in Google Cloud, though YouTube growth slowed relative to Q1. The analyst further added that the AI commentary of the management was encouraging.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): A Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent days following reports that the pre-orders for the much-awaited iPhone 16 series have been below analyst expectations and are down more than 10% compared to pre-orders for the previous version of the phone. According to reports, 37 million units of the new iPhone have been ordered, and one of the main reasons behind the slowdown in orders has been the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro. In the Pro version of the new iPhone, Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered features of the new Apple software, are not available at launch. China competition has also impacted iPhone sales.\n\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wall Street analysts have bullish views. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Low Demand for iPhone 16 Sinking Apple Stock?",
        "content": "There’s been a resurgence in AI names recently. There’s also been a split between the haves and the have-nots. Look, I dare not call Apple (AAPL) a have-not, but in the grand scheme of the AI moves we’ve seen, they are being left out of the party. The latest pre-order data for iPhone 16 is coming up somewhat lower than last year too. That’s leading to some lagging when it comes to share price.\n\nAAPL has come down from over $230 at the end of August to the $216 level on Monday. It’s looking overhead to its 50-dayh moving average and is under pressure. RSI has come down sharply, now at 40 and dropping as the selling continues. The now infamous August 5th bottom is at $196. The stock should tick up to fill the gap and retest the 50-day before it gets uglier. If it doesn’t, then the 200-day and a retest of the lows could happen in short order.\n\nMoving Averages: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock's moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.\n\nSupport and Resistance Levels: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.\n\nChart Patterns: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.\n\nVolume Analysis: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.\n\nDave Bartosiak's technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding Apple’s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it's important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What are share buybacks?",
        "content": "A boom in share buybacks has seen a number of companies using this strategy to return money to investors and boost the value of their stock.\n\nTech company Microsoft (MSFT) has announced a $60bn (£45.4bn) share buyback programme, while also raising its quarterly dividend by 10%.\n\nIt isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" tech company to announce a huge buyback in 2024, with Apple (AAPL) launching a $110bn repurchasing plan and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) also unveiling a $70bn programme. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Facebook-parent Meta (META) have announced $50bn buyback programmes in 2024.\n\nBuybacks have also grown in popularity in the UK, as major London-listed companies such as oil major BP (BP.L) and bank Barclays (BARC.L) have launched their own buyback plans.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nA share repurchase, or share buyback, is when a company rebuys its own shares and returns funds to its investors.\n\nThe issuing company usually acquires its own stock by distributing cash to existing holders, paying the market value per share, in exchange for a portion of the company’s outstanding equity.\n\nRead more: Bank of England bond sales could cost government almost £100bn by 2028\n\nWhen a company repurchases its own shares, this reduces the number of shares held by the public.\n\nCompanies can purchase the stock on the open market or from shareholders directly.\n\nWhy do companies do this?\n\nBuybacks became particularly popular during the Covid pandemic as the economic fallout left companies with mounting debt piles from loans and government bailouts. Repurchasing shares enabled firms to reduce debt, shore up their finances and consolidate ownership.\n\nShare buybacks globally hit a record $1.31tn in 2022, but then dipped back $1.11tn last year, according to Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed that share buybacks were nearing their lowest annual value since 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe aggregate value of share buyback transactions for companies trading on major global exchanges through to 9 September 2024 was nearly $164bn, down 35% on the same period last year. That figure was also even lower than the nearly $179bn in buybacks in the comparable period in 2020.\n\nDespite this slowdown in the amount companies are repurchasing, the strategy is still popular, with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed the number of buybacks is up year-on-year.\n\nRead more: Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\n\nThere were 983 buyback transactions worldwide this year up to 9 September, up from 823 for the same period last year and the highest number since the first nine months of 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to shoring up finances, buybacks also provide a more flexible way of returning money to shareholders as an alternative to dividends. Public companies have a goal of maximising returns for their investors, so if a firm is generating more cash than it needs to fund its operations, buybacks are a good option for excess cash.\n\nShare repurchases also increase the company’s equity value, and help businesses to look more financially attractive to investors.\n\nIf a board feels that its company’s stock is undervalued, buybacks are one way to solve this, and are often seen as an expression of confidence by the company.\n\nNot only do they provide an additional exit route to shareholders when shares are undervalued or are thinly traded, but also prevent unwelcome takeover bids.\n\nHowever, as they are typically financed with debt, it can sometimes strain cash flow.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nAs share repurchases cut the total number of shares outstanding, and the total amount of cash on the firm’s balance sheet, this affects several metrics used by investors to estimate a company’s valuation.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nSome of these metrics include earnings per share (EPS), a measure used by investors, and the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nFewer shares in circulation increases a company’s EPS, and a higher EPS normally means a higher share price.\n\nRecent share repurchases\n\nOutside of the major US tech companies, there have been a number of buyback announcements this year.\n\nBP launched a new buyback of $1.75bn in February, with plans to repurchase at least $14bn in shares over 2024-25.\n\nFellow oil major Shell (SHEL.L) also announced a $3.5bn buyback programme earlier in the year.\n\nBarclays also shared its intention to repurchase a further £750m of its shares in August, as part of plans return at least £10bn in capital to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAnother bank to declare a buyback was HSBC (HSBA.L), which announced a repurchasing programme of up to $3bn in July.\n\nEuropean banks have also jumped on the trend, with Italy's UniCredit (UCG.MI) initiating its €1.7bn (£1.4bn) repurchasing plan on Monday, while Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.SW) also launched a $2bn programme.\n\nMeanwhile, UK supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L) also committed in April to buying back an additional £1bn worth of shares by April 2025.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Founder vs. activist: A dramatic two-year battle over health-tech firm Masimo comes to a head this week",
        "content": "Joe Kiani remembers the day that everything changed at work. On Feb. 15, 2022, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Masimo announced the $1 billion acquisition of Sound United.\n\nWhile Kiani knew the acquisition of consumer audio company by a medical devices company was bound to raise eyebrows, he presumed that Masimo’s track record—and his three-decade-plus tenure at the helm—had earned him the trust of shareholders. He’d announced the deal after a solid quarter, with profits of $68.3 million on sales of $327.6 million. He’d noted that audio technologies could add new capabilities to Masimo’s core products, allowing it to expand in the wearables and “hearables” markets. “To me, the possibilities were compelling,” said Kiani.\n\nBut the response from Masimo shareholders was, “Huh?” Within a day, the stock dropped more than 35%. The ensuing drama caught the eye of Quentin Koffey, a veteran investor who’d burnished his reputation at activist funds like Elliott Management, D.E. Shaw and Senator before starting Politan Capital Management, his own activist hedge fund, in 2021.\n\nKoffey viewed the acquisition as emblematic of broader governance issues that put too much power in the hands of Kiani. Six months later, Politan announced that it had acquired nearly 9% of Masimo. And the struggle for the company’s future was about to begin.\n\nBoth sides have since waged a nasty public battle that will come to a head on Sept. 19 when shareholders vote in a second proxy contest to determine whether Kiani will keep his seat on the board. Koffey won the first proxy contest in June of 2023, putting himself and healthcare veteran Michelle Brennan on the board. Koffey accuses Kiani of running his public company like a private fiefdom; Kiani says Koffey has been duplicitous in his communication to shareholders and unwilling to engage with management, coming to the table with no plan but to make a name for himself and his young hedge fund.\n\nKiani characterizes this week’s vote as a referendum on “the future of Masimo,” vowing to leave if Koffey wins. Masimo COO and heir apparent, Bilal Muhsin, has threatened to quit if his boss is voted off the board. The company has also posted employee letters full of praise and warnings, including a note from some 280 healthcare engineers who wrote that they “may not continue with the company if Joe Kiani is replaced.”\n\nThink about that for a second. Masimo is a $2-billion-a-year company with several thousand employees, steady earnings and a niche product that’s used by about 200 million people in hospitals and homes worldwide. Why does Koffey think it’s okay if the guy who built the company is threatening to walk out the door? Why does Kiani think it’s okay for his COO and hundreds of his employees to pledge that they’ll join him?\n\nStory continues\n\nActivism at a record high\n\nThe Masimo drama demonstrates the power and the perils of shareholder activism. In 2022, as Koffey was announcing Politan’s stake in Masimo, the SEC put into effect a “universal proxy card\" rule that required companies to list all nominees for board seats on one voting card, making it cheaper and easier for dissident shareholders to mount challenges. Indeed, the volume of shareholder campaigns this year is on track to exceed last year’s record number, with Lazard reporting 147 new campaigns in the first half of 2024.\n\nWhat the SEC did not do is force activists to reveal their backers, which has long been a source of tension for corporate boards. When you’re embroiled in an IP battle with Apple, as Masimo was, it seems only logical to want to know who’s invested in the fund that’s trying to force you to do things you don’t want to do.  Meanwhile, as Kiani pointed to Masimo’s long track record of success, Koffey pointed to the company’s underperforming stock and a board that rarely challenged its iconic founder-CEO.\n\nThe acrimony is evident throughout the timeline: This March, three days after Masimo agreed to separate its consumer business, effectively unwinding much of the Sound United acquisition, Politan announced it would seek to add two more independent directors, stating that Kiani had denied them “basic information” needed to make decisions.\n\nThis Thursday, the two-year war will come to a head at Masimo’s annual general meeting. That meeting itself was delayed two months after Masimo filed a lawsuit against Politan to “correct material misstatements and omissions”—which the activist firm eventually did. But Masimo did not succeed in delaying the vote again. If shareholders vote to bring Politan’s slate of former Agilent Technologies CTO Darlene Solomon and former Stryker CFO Bill Jellison on to the board, effectively displacing Kiani, the Masimo founder has said he’ll quit the company.\n\nHow did a proxy fight escalate to become a battle with such high stakes that many of those who built the company are now willing to abandon it if the boss doesn’t stick around? Part of it may be the nature of shareholders activists, who typically try to force boards and management to do things they don’t want to do, the better to raise the share price and make good on the activists’ bets.\n\nAnother factor is the passion, the pain, and possibly the hubris of Masimo’s founding CEO. After 35 years, Joe Kiani believes that no one but him—and the people he’s chosen— can run this company. In conversations with dozens of investors and stakeholders, it turns out that many people think he’s right.\n\nPatents and passions\n\nIf there’s a founder mode, Kiani has been in it since starting Masimo in 1989. Along with being chairman and CEO, he holds more than 500 patents or patent applications related to advanced signal processing, optical sensors and wearable technologies.\n\nBut the most important discoveries were the ones he made early on.  As an electrical engineering student at San Diego State University in the 1980s, Kiani became interested in improving the pulse oximeter—those little devices that clip on your finger to measure oxygen levels in the blood. While the technology dates back almost a century, the first device was created in the 1970s by a Japanese engineer named Takuo Aoyagi, who discovered that blood oxygenation levels could be measured by shining red and infrared light through a pulsating artery, analyzing differences in light absorption to calculate oxygen saturation.\n\nThe problem was that those devices could give false readings when a patient was moving. Kiani solved that problem by developing signal extraction technology that could distinguish between the noise caused by blood flow and motion from walking, shivering, or other movements. The devices became standard issue in hospitals, making Masimo the gold standard in noninvasive monitoring of blood oxygen levels, as well as the pulse signal and fluid responsiveness in patients, among other things.\n\nThat attracted attention over the years, as well as rivals like Apple, which developed similar health monitoring features in devices like the Apple Watch. What might have been a fruitful licensing deal for Masimo instead became a high-profile intellectual property dispute as Masimo accused Apple of stealing trade secrets and infringing patents. That battle ended in a mistrial in May 2023, although a separate ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) did find that Apple did infringe one patent; Apple stopped selling smartwatches with blood oxygen sensors last year as it appeals the ruling.\n\nEven as Kiani dueled with Apple, Quentin Koffey was homing in on issues related to Kiani, his unpopular acquisition of Sound United and his apparent control over the company he built. Kiani and Koffey met in early September of 2022, shortly after Politan declared its stake. Years earlier, Masimo’s board had adopted a change-in-control provision to Kiani’s employment agreement that would give him approximately $600 million if, among other things, a new lead independent director was appointed. The appointment of two new directors would constitute a change in control, making the new provision a classic poison pill. (Kiani later waived those provisions.)\n\nIn June 2023, after shareholders voted to bring Politan’s slate of Koffey and Brennan on to the board, many assumed the battle would now be over. But tensions on both sides continued. When Masimo announced in March this year that the company would explore separating its consumer business, which included audio equipment, baby monitors, and smartwatches—leaving Kiani to run the rest while chairing the spinoff—Politan was caught off guard on the details. Citing “serious concerns” about control, intellectual property, and communication around the new entity, Politan said it would be seeking a second proxy contest, the one that will now be decided later this week.\n\nReluctant successor\n\nBilal Muhsin joined Masimo as an intern, joining the company full time after completing a bachelor’s degree in computer science at San Diego State University in 2000. As chief operating officer, he says, “I’m responsible for everything in the healthcare division, right from sales to operations to engineering,” adding that “it’s an honor” to have played such a critical role in a company that saves lives.\n\nMuhsin knows he’s poised to replace Kiani should something ever happen to the boss. So why would he vow to quit if Koffey succeeds in getting shareholders to vote in two more independent directors?\n\n“I wanted to be honest with investors; I didn’t want it to come as a surprise to them,” says Muhsin, who also worries about the culture of innovation and Kiani’s long-term vision. “If the board that comes on is similar to the last round, where they sided together and decided not to engage, I don’t know.”\n\n“If Joe decides to leave on his own, he would leave behind a legacy of people to execute ... this place would continue and thrive,” he adds. If Koffey succeeds in adding new directors and Kiani leaves, though, Muhsin says, “I don’t believe that is a bright future that’s going to lead to more innovation and benefit the company … If that does take place, I will most likely not be here.”\n\nThat’s a rather draconian approach to a new governance structure, much like the idea of kicking out the man who built this company and its products. In filings, Koffey has insisted that removing Kiani altogether is not the goal, saying he seeks merely to bring in more oversight.\n\nKoffey has refused to speak on the record to reporters, pointing instead to Masimo press releases and court filings. Many of Masimo’s directors and key investors prefer to do the same, or understandably want to approve whatever appears in print. In a heated proxy battle, that often leaves journalists to interview people who share reservations in private that they are too scared to share in public, or people who feel pressured to take a stance that’s far less nuanced than they feel.\n\nBut one man is eager to speak up: Joe Kiani. “I believe we’re going to win this thing,” he says. “I’m not some mad entrepreneur who wants to do things a certain way. I want to do what’s good for my company. I think consumer health is the future of health care and I want us to be there.”\n\n“I hope I don’t have to leave this. I have a succession plan. The problem is, if he wins, the succession plan would leave with me. They’re not going to want to stay and it’s going to be a disaster.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "During the much-anticipated “Glowtime” event, Apple unveiled its new products, including the latest iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. But what the tech giant demonstrated was a renewed focus on health, boasting two “groundbreaking” features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods Pro 2: sleep apnea detection and hearing aid features.\n\n“These new features expand across products, bringing informative and powerful ways to support users in their sleep and hearing health for conditions that impact billions globally,” according to Apple’s press release.\n\nIf you’re intrigued by whether Apple’s new tech can help you optimize your health, here’s what you need to know about how the new features will work.\n\nSleep apnea detection\n\nSleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes breathing to repeatedly stop and start, according to the Mayo Clinic. It can cause you to snore loudly, not feel well-rested even after a full night of sleep, and may lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues.\n\nApple hopes to help users of its newest Apple Watches (Series 10, Series 9, and Ultra 2) recognize if they may have sleep apnea through a feature called Breathing Disturbances.\n\nIt works by using the accelerometer in the watch, which detects small movements at the wrist that could be signs of interruptions to normal respiratory patterns during sleep, Apple explains in the press release. Every 30 days, users can check the Health app to see breathing disturbance data, which notify you with consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea. After that, you can decide whether or not to talk to your doctor about next steps to address it.\n\nThe breathing disturbances feature can double as a metric of how restful your sleep is, Apple says. Sleep quality can be impacted by things like napping too late or too long, alcohol or caffeine consumption, or racing thoughts. The Health app will show nightly breathing disturbances picked up by the Apple Watch, which can reveal trends over time.\n\nYou can export a PDF of your breathing disturbances data to show your doctor, especially if you’re concerned about sleep apnea.\n\nApple says the sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning technology paired with an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. Apple then validated the feature in a clinical study, in which every participant identified by the algorithm was found to have at least mild sleep apnea.\n\n“This is a major step forward in improving public health,” Dr. Sairam Parthasarathy of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center for Sleep, Circadian, and Neurosciences’s professor and director in Tucson, Arizona, said in the release..\n\nStory continues\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration just gave clearance to Apple’s sleep apnea detection devices—a step toward approval.\n\n‘A clinical-grade hearing aid’\n\nHearing loss is frustrating for anyone, especially when you’re trying to use hearing aids that can be counterintuitive or uncomfortable. With the new generation of AirPods Pro, users can employ a hearing aid capability supposed to be on par with over-the-counter hearing aids, Apple writes, best for people with mild to moderate hearing loss.\n\nAfter taking Apple’s five-minute hearing test at home with the AirPods—found in the Health app—the headphones’ technology can transform “AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid,” according to the press release It takes into account your personal hearing test results, enabling “personalized dynamic adjustments” based on your hearing needs in the environment you’re in to boost audio in real time.\n\nThe hearing aid feature can also be set up with an audiogram from a professional.\n\nApple says people with little to no hearing loss can benefit from the hearing test as well, as the test profile will enable specific audio adjustments at individual frequencies.\n\n“Hearing health is a cornerstone of overall wellbeing. Protecting and preserving our hearing enhances our quality of life both in the short-term and long-term,” said Rick Neitzel, professor at University of Michigan School of Public Health and principal investigator of the Apple Hearing Study.\n\nFor more on health tech:\n\nTop CEOs are obsessed with this $300 Oura Ring that tracks sleep and health metrics Continuous glucose monitors are trendy wearables—but how useful are they?

        "title": "These Were the 5 Biggest Companies in 1999, and Here Are the 5 Biggest Companies Now",
        "content": "I won't keep you in suspense. The five biggest public companies in the world on Jan. 1, 1999, ranked in order from largest to smallest, were:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): $348 billion market cap General Electric(NYSE: GE): $261 billion market cap Intel(NASDAQ: INTC): $197 billion market cap Walmart(NYSE: WMT): $181 billion market cap ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM): $178 billion market cap\n\nHaving said that, there are a few important things to mention. For one thing, 1999 was the height of the dot-com bubble, and there was quite a bit of movement on the list throughout the year. For example, by the end of 1999, Microsoft had reached a market cap of more than $600 billion. Plus, Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) had catapulted its way into the No. 3 spot, while Intel had fallen off it entirely.\n\nThe 5 biggest companies now\n\nAs you might expect given that 25 years have passed since 1999, the list of the largest public companies in the world has changed considerably. Here's where it stands as of Sep. 7, 2024:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.39 trillion Microsoft: $3.00 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): $2.53 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $1.88 trillion Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.78 trillion\n\nMicrosoft is the only company that appears on both lists, and the scale of the players on it has increased by about tenfold. Notably, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total U.S. inflation over that period was only around 92%, so most of that change reflects real growth, not a decline in the value of the dollar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

It gets larger display options, a slimmer body, a faster-charging battery, and audio playback via its built-in speaker.\n\nThe 10th anniversary Apple Watch doesn’t just get hardware updates, though. The Series 10 also introduces a bevy of software features via watchOS 11, including sleep apnea detection, the ability to pause fitness tracking when you’re sick and don’t want to feel guilty for not exercising, and a new Vitals app that tracks your health over time and tells you if important metrics like body temperature and respiration are off.\n\nIf you’re still sporting an Apple Watch Series 6 or older, it’s easy to recommend that you upgrade to the Series 10.

Your older watch will still get watchOS 11, and the difference between screen sizes is harder to discern unless you’re looking at your old Apple Watch right next to the Series 10.\n\nThat said, if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch, the Series 10, with its hardware improvements, is the one to go with.\n\nBigger screen, smaller body, more power\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 comes with two new size options: the $399 42-millimeter version and the $429 46mm model. That’s 9% more screen real estate than the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7, 8, and 9 and 7% more than the 45mm Series 7, 8, and 9. The Apple Watch Series 10 brings bigger displays and new health tracking features to Apple's popular smartwatch. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nI wear a 45mm Apple Watch Series 8 virtually every day, and it’s pretty tough for me to spot the difference between the 46mm and 45mm displays. Yes, you get an extra line or so of text when reading text messages or news articles on the larger screens, but I wouldn’t say that’s enough to drop a few hundred bucks on a new watch.\n\nIt’s a different story when you’re coming from the older Apple Watches, though. Apple says the 42mm Series 10 has 30% more screen space than the 40mm version of the Series 4, 5, and 6, while the 46mm model offers a 25% larger display than the 44mm Series 4, 5, and 6. And if you’re coming from the Series 2 or 3, you’ll get between 75% and 65% more screen area. In those cases, you’ll absolutely notice the larger display.\n\nApple says the Series 10 screens now feature wide-angle OLED technology, making them easier to see at an angle, which is generally how people look at their watches. The Series 10 body is also 1mm thinner than the Series 7, 8, and 9 and offers a more rounded design than its predecessors. The result is a watch that sits more comfortably on your wrist.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s also a new speaker on the side that lets you play music from your wrist. It’s not going to sound as good as it would coming out of your iPhone or AirPods, but it gets the job done if you’re in a relatively quiet space and need some tunes. Don’t try using it as your shower speaker, though: You won’t be able to hear it. Apple's new sleep apnea detection feature will alert you if you experience breathing disturbances while you sleep, a key indicator that you may have the sleep disorder. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 still gets the same 18 hours of battery life as last year’s model, but Apple says it’s refined the charging system so that you’ll now get up to 8 hours of use from just 15 minutes of charge time and fill 80% of the battery in 30 minutes. That makes it far easier to use the Apple Watch to track your sleep at night since you can now drop it on the charger while you get ready in the morning and have plenty of juice to power it throughout the day.\n\nIn my experience, the Apple Watch Series 10's battery has lasted all day, overnight while tracking my sleep, and well into the next day before I needed to recharge it.\n\nApple's watchOS 11\n\nApple’s watchOS 11, the latest version of the operating system that powers the Apple Watch line, includes a host of new features for the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer as well as the Ultra, Ultra 2, and second-generation Apple Watch SE.\n\nThe new Vitals app records your health stats while you sleep to provide you with an ongoing record of your overall general wellness. That includes your heart and respiratory rates, wrist temperature, blood, and sleep duration.\n\nThe idea is to give you a sense of what’s normal for your body and provide you with a better understanding of what impacts your health and fitness, whether that’s being sick or having a few too many adult beverages during happy hour.\n\nApple has also added a Training Load feature that logs your overall effort while working out. Over time, you can see if you’re pushing yourself harder or going too easy while exercising and adjust your workouts appropriately. I’ve been using Training Load for the past week and appreciate the ability to see when I’ve been working out too hard and when I’ve needed to step it up. The new Check In feature will alert your custom contact when you finish a workout like a long run. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nWatchOS 11 also includes a new Check In option that lets you send an alert to your close contacts when you finish a workout like an outdoor run. I was out for a run a few months back and was hit by a car, and while I was able to call my wife right away, Check In would have been incredibly helpful if I hadn't been. If she didn’t get a Check In alert in the normal time it usually takes for me to complete my run, she could have looked up my location in the Find My app to see what was going on.\n\nApple is also rolling out a new sleep apnea detection function for the Apple Watch. The feature tracks micro-movements using the watch’s accelerometer to determine if you’re having trouble breathing. Every 30 days the software will analyze your data to determine if you’re experiencing sleep disturbances and alert you if you may be at risk of sleep apnea. You can then take that data to your doctor to further discuss the matter.\n\nIt took years of me snoring at night before I finally went to get a sleep test to determine that I had sleep apnea. But if my watch had been telling me I had a potential problem, I likely would have gone out and gotten one sooner. That said, if you’re already being treated for the disorder like me, this feature isn’t for you.\n\nBetter and bigger\n\nI’m a big fan of the Apple Watch, partly because I like getting notifications without having to check my phone all the time and because I love tracking my fitness activity. With its updated hardware and improved software, the Apple Watch Series 10 is the company’s best iteration of its popular wearable yet.\n\nThat said, it’s not exactly necessary to upgrade if you’re already rocking a Series 8 or newer. You’ve still got a great watch that will easily run watchOS 11. If you’ve got an older model, however, now is the time to consider making the jump to the latest model, especially if you’re coming from a Series 6 or older.\n\nNow I’m off to test out the watch’s sleep tracking feature a little more. It’s for work, after all. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Teresa Ribera will have to square up to Big Tech, banks and airlines if confirmed as Europe's new antitrust chief, while juggling calls for looser rules to help create EU champions.\n\nNominated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for the high-profile antitrust post on Tuesday, Ribera has been Spain's minister for ecological transition since 2018.\n\nThe 55-year-old Spanish socialist, one of Europe's most ambitious policymakers on climate change, will have to secure European Parliament approval before taking up her post.\n\nAs competition commissioner, she will be able to approve or veto multi-billion euro mergers or slap hefty fines on companies seeking to bolster their market power by throttling smaller rivals or illegally teaming up to fix prices.\n\nOne of her biggest challenges will be to ensure that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Meta comply with landmark rules aimed at reining in their power and giving consumers more choice.\n\nApple, Google and Meta are firmly in outgoing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crosshairs for falling short of complying with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nAnother challenge will be how to deal with the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence amid concerns about Big Tech leveraging its existing dominance.\n\nRibera may ramp up a crackdown on non-EU state subsidies begun by Vestager aimed at preventing foreign companies from acquiring EU businesses or taking part in EU public tenders with unfair state support.\n\nRecent rulings from Europe's highest court, which backed the Commission's 13 billion euro tax order to Apple, and its 2.42 billion euro antitrust fine against Google, could embolden Ribera to take a tough line against antitrust violations.\n\nThat would mean she would be in no hurry to ease up on antitrust rules, despite Mario Draghi's call to boost EU industrial champions so that they are able to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors.\n\nRibera was also named on Tuesday as executive vice president of a clean, just and competitive energy transition, tasked with ensuring that Europe achieves its green goals.\n\nHer credentials include negotiating deals among EU countries on emissions limits for trucks and a contentious upgrade of EU power market rules last year.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; additional reporting by Marine Strauss and Kate Abnett; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Alexander Smith)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nThe world's most valuable company Apple saw billions wiped off its market capitalisation on Monday, after an analyst warned of weak demand for its new iPhone 16.\n\nShares in the tech company were down nearly 3% at market close on Monday, taking its market valuation to $3.29tn (£2.49tn).\n\nTF International Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a post on Medium that he had calculated first-weekend pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 to be an estimated 37 million units, around 12.7% lower than first-weekend sales of the iPhone 15 last year.\n\nHe said: \"One of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release.\"\n\nThe iPhone 16 is due to hit store shelves on 20 September, but its generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform Apple Intelligence is set to begin its rollout as a software update for US English users in October.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets higher as traders look to central bank decisions\n\nMaxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte told Yahoo Finance on Monday: \"I think the challenge for Apple, as reflected in those reports, is that they're trying to get a consumer to buy new hardware, which is coming out in the month of September.\n\n\"But the best-selling point for that hardware, especially for consumers in the US — Apple Intelligence, the AI-related features — those aren't coming out until beta next month.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nThe world's second most valuable company Microsoft had a positive trading session on Monday, following the news that its board had approved a new share buyback programme of up to $60bn.\n\nThe company also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share, an increase of 10% on the previous quarter.\n\nShares closed Monday's session closed slightly higher and were up more than 1% in pre-market trading on Tuesday.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"The share buyback juggernaut has moved into the fast lane.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\n“While tech companies are increasingly paying more generous dividends to shareholders, their preferred method of deploying surplus cash is to buy back shares.\"\n\nWhen companies buy back shares this reduces the amount on the market, which boosts earnings per share and in turn, can drive the market value of a business higher.\n\nMould said: \"Fundamentally, investors love share buybacks. They particularly love them when they are least expected, which is certainly the case for Microsoft. One might have expected the tech giant to spend all its surplus cash on AI-related investments, but it is clearly balancing the needs of the business with keeping shareholders happy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nAnother tech company in the green was chipmaker Intel, with shares up more than 6% at Monday's close and up nearly 7% in pre-market trading.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced in a memo to staff that it had agreed a deal to make custom chips for Amazon's (AMZN) web services business.\n\nGelsinger said the company planned to establish Intel Foundry, its contract manufacturing business, as an independent subsidiary business. Earlier this year, Intel said operating losses for the foundry business had deepened to $7bn in 2023.\n\nGelsinger also said the company was more than halfway to its targets of reducing its workforce by around 15,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nIntel has faced challenges this year, as it missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings, citing challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to increase production of its AI chips. The company also decided to suspend its dividend, which will come into effect in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nShares are still down 58% year-to-date, but the stock has ticked higher in the last couple of days, starting with news on Friday the European Commission had given Poland the green light to grant the company more than $1.9bn in state aid to support its chip assembly and testing plant.\n\nKingfisher (KGF.L)\n\nB&Q-owner Kingfisher surged nearly 7% on Tuesday morning, after the company posted a 2.3% rise in pre-tax profits in the first half of its year to £324m.\n\nThe DIY-chain owner also lifted its guidance for full-year adjusted pre-tax profits to a tighter range of between £510m and £550m, up from £490m to £550m.\n\nThierry Garnier, CEO of Kingfisher, said that, as anticipated, demand for \"big ticket\" items such as kitchens and bathrooms \"remained weak, in line with the broader market, while seasonal category sales trends have improved since early July\".\n\nThis latest update shows continued improvement on last autumn, when the company issued profit warnings in September and then November.\n\nRead more: Gold hits record high as investors anticipate major US Fed rate cut\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “Kingfisher has seen some home improvement of its own, with the UK and Ireland continuing to prop up the wider business against a generally tough European backdrop.\n\n\"In terms of the market consensus, the general view of the shares as a hold could conceivably come under some positive pressure should investors recognise an improving direction of travel.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Online retailers in China have slashed the prices of Apple's new iPhone 16 series ahead of its official release, as consumers in the world's largest smartphone market hold out for the release of the US company's first on-device artificial intelligence (AI) software.\n\nPDD Holdings' Pinduoduo, one of the country's most popular e-commerce platforms, has started selling the iPhone 16 Plus with 512 gigabytes of storage for 8,999 yuan (US$1,268), a 10 per cent discount from the official price of 9,999 yuan. The 128GB iPhone 16 is being sold at an even steeper 11 per cent discount.\n\nBoth Pinduoduo and Alibaba Group Holding's' Taobao marketplace have slapped a 4 per cent discount on the 256GB version of the high-end iPhone 16 Pro Max, lowering the price by 400 yuan to 9,599 yuan. Alibaba's Tmall shopping platform also offers buyers the option to pay for a new Apple handset in 24 instalments without interest charges.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: AFP alt=An Apple store in Beijing. Photo: AFP>\n\nThe discounts suggest soft demand for Apple's latest flagship handsets in China, a major market for the world's most valuable company and one of the world's most competitive. The iPhone 16 ships this Friday without AI features, considered the main selling point of the new series.\n\nWhile Apple said it will launch its AI system in US English next month and in localised English in several markets in December, other languages, including Chinese, will not be available until next year. The company has also given no indication of how it plans to offer Apple Intelligence in China, where the government has tight oversight over generative AI services accessible by the public.\n\nInitial response to the new iPhone on Chinese social media appeared to be tepid.\n\nAcross the globe, pre-order sales in the first weekend for the iPhone 16 series were down nearly 13 per cent from last year's iPhone 15 series, partly because Apple Intelligence is missing at launch, according to Kuo Ming-chi, analyst at TF International Securities.\n\n\"Additionally, intense competition in the Chinese market continues to impact iPhone demand,\" he said.\n\nThe Mate XT smartphone on display at a Huawei store in Shanghai. Photo: EPA-EFE alt=The Mate XT smartphone on display at a Huawei store in Shanghai. Photo: EPA-EFE>\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, Huawei Technologies unveiled in its home market the Mate XT, a double-hinge foldable smartphone, just hours after Apple introduced the iPhone 16. Huawei made a surprise comeback to the 5G smartphone market last year with a device equipped with an advanced, locally-made processor, in defiance of US sanctions.\n\nApple risks losing further market share to Huawei and other domestic brands in the premium segment in China, consultancy Counterpoint Research said last month.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company recently fell out of the top five ranking of smartphone vendors in China by quarterly shipments, the first time that domestic vendors dominated all the top five positions, according to research firm Canalys.\n\nBut Apple so far appears unfazed by the competition from Huawei.\n\nThe US tech giant has lowered the trade-in value, or the amount of money a consumer receives for trading in their older device for a new one, by up to 16 per cent in China, according to a Jefferies research note last week.\n\n\"Apple may now conclude Huawei's tech capabilities are constrained by advanced chip access, and for those who wanted to switch from iPhone to Huawei have already done so,\" Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Super Micro Computer, Apple and Nvidia",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Super Micro Computer SMCI, Apple AAPL and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nTime to Buy These Closely-Watched Stocks? NVDA, SMCI, AAPL\n\nTechnology stocks have remained at the forefront of market headlines all year long, with excitement surrounding AI and a resilient economy leading to outsized gains.\n\nAnd over the past few weeks, three tech stocks in particular – Super Micro Computer, Apple and Nvidia – have been the three most popular stocks being searched for on the Zacks website.\n\nGiven their popularity, let’s take a closer look at how each presently stacks up.\n\nNVDA Remains AI Favorite\n\nNVDA shares have been the hottest topic of 2024, widely outperforming on the back of record-breaking quarterly results. The company’s earnings outlook remains bright across the board, with the current $2.80 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 115% year-over-year growth.\n\nConcerning its latest quarterly release, the AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting a 15% sequential jump from Q1 and an even more impressive 122% year-over-year climb. The company’s sales growth has been remarkable, with this period’s results penciling in the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the true focal point of the release, which again delivered in a big way. Data Center sales reached a quarterly record of $26.3 billion, up 16% sequentially from Q1 and 154% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nJensen Huang was unsurprisingly bullish on the Data Center, stating, ‘Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.’\n\nAs shown below, the company’s Data Center results have regularly blown away our consensus estimates as of late, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.4 billion.\n\nApple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro\n\nTech titan Apple recently hosted its Apple Event, which showcased several new models of existing products. A few of the notable features of Apple’s new iPhone 16 Pro include better battery life, AI capabilities (coming in beta later this fall), and the biggest display screen yet.\n\nThe earnings picture is still in great shape for the tech titan, with analysts revising their expectations higher across the board over recent months.\n\nThe company’s iPhone results have been somewhat mixed as of late, delivering both misses and beats over the past year. A slowdown in China iPhone sales has been a thorn in the side of the company, which fell 6.5% year-over-year throughout its latest period.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it’s worth noting that the company’s Services portfolio, which has shown great growth, has eased the blow from the iPhone’s slowing growth considerably. Services revenue of $24.2 billion throughout its latest period reflected a quarterly record, 15% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nThe company’s Services results have consistently exceeded consensus expectations.\n\nIt’s been no secret that the company’s growth has been stalling, but perhaps recent news surrounding its new lineup of products can reverse the trend. Apple is in the very early innings of its AI offerings, a key aspect to keep in mind when sizing up its long-term prospects.\n\nSMCI Faces Fraud Allegations\n\nSMCI shares have been decimated since making their all-time high in mid-March, down more than 60% after an enormous run to begin the year. Shares faced pressure following the release of its recent quarterly results, with a recent short report from Hindenburg Research accusing the company of accounting manipulation not helping the stock either.\n\nThe company is a total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, fully explaining the buzz around the stock in 2024. Like NVDA, the company’s reported sales have shot higher, penciling in triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates in each of its last three quarters.\n\nFor those unaware, SMCI has had an interesting history, with the recent short report not the first time the company has been accused of fraud. In 2018, SMCI was temporarily delisted for failing to file financial statements, and by 2020, was charged $17.5 million by the SEC for “widespread accounting violations.”\n\nAnd on August 28th, the company delayed the filing of its 10-K annual report, bringing about further scrutiny. Time will tell what happens concerning the recent short report, but the stock undoubtedly has some questions surrounding it, a critical development that investors should keep close tabs on.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTech stocks continue to be the craze, with their strong quarterly performances and the buzz surrounding AI pushing them higher all throughout 2024.\n\nAnd concerning the ones investors have been most curious about, all three stocks above have been in high demand on Zacks.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Morgan Stanley’s Best Stock Picks for 2025",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\n\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\n\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\n\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\n\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\n\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\n\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\n\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\n\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow – requiring “Goldilocks” growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 184\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 23%\n\nShare Price Target: $273\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. With roughly $1.46 billion people using an iPhone worldwide, the phone is the bedrock of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. This is also evident through the fact that 52% of the firm's revenue comes from smartphones, and its sizeable user base has also allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to build a tertiary Services business capable of generating $78 billion in revenue annually. The user base is baked into the firm's share price, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s value is based primarily on its ability to ensure regular iPhone upgrades by keeping users in its fold through a closed ecosystem and unique design. It has also meant that the shares have managed to avoid Wall Street's AI jitters in 2024, as while enterprise AI players like MSFT are down by 7.9% since the July peak, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares have lost just 1.70%. The ability to monetize AI and ensure regular upgrades are the two pillars of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Dan Ives Predicts an Apple \"Supercycle\" With the New AI-Optimized iPhone. What Could This Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "When longtime tech sector analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush speaks, investors tend to listen. He's one of the more prominent voices in stock punditry, and more than a few of his calls have proved to be accurate.\n\nSo the market noticed when Ives waxed bullish on the next phase of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) development, which he believes will be an upgrade \"supercycle\" starting with the just-introduced iPhone 16. The analyst feels that masses of people currently using older iPhone models will be eager to switch to the 16, mostly because of one feature that should produce a surge in demand.\n\nAn even more intelligent smartphone\n\nThat feature is Apple Intelligence, which, as the name strongly implies, is the tech giant's artificial intelligence (AI) platform. Apple Intelligence is to be packed into all iPhones starting with the 16. So far it's been something of a rare bird, with access limited to the high-end iPhone 15 Pro series.\n\nIves wrote, in a research note on the company, that users of old iPhones won't be able to resist the lure of AI. Brisk sales of AI-stuffed iPhone 16s should result and, as a consequence, developers will create hundreds of AI-powered apps for Apple's iOS. This will make the company an important driver, or the important driver, of AI development in the vast consumer sphere. In turn, this should significantly boost Apple's fundamentals and crank up demand for its stock.\n\n\"We believe [Wall] Street is starting to slowly recognize that with Apple Intelligence on the doorstep in essence Cupertino will be the gatekeepers of the consumer AI revolution,\" the analyst wrote in late August, just before the iPhone 16's introduction.\n\nAccording to Ives's research, around 300 million iPhone users have not upgraded their hardware in more than four years (all told, there are 1.5 billion iPhones in this world, according to his estimates, forming the bulk of the 2.2 billion Apple devices in total). Assuming his prediction comes true, the company could indeed see sudden, skyrocketing demand from folks wanting the 16. He put a dollar figure on this, forecasting that Apple stands to reap $30 to $40 per share in monetization opportunities from AI alone.\n\nCurb your enthusiasm\n\nLike a host of tech companies, incumbent and upstart alike, Apple is pushing hard to be a first-mover in mass-market AI. For all its size, reach, and power, though, pole position is by no means guaranteed. To cite but one example, Apple's peer/rival Microsoft has developed and deployed Copilot, a suite of AI tools that is being integrated into a wide range of that company's software and services.\n\nLike the iPhone 16 with Apple Intelligence, Microsoft is baking a version of Copilot into hardware too. In May it introduced a new series of Windows PCs that will have its Copilot+ pre-installed. The AI revolution might end up being spearheaded not by iPhones and iPads but by desk jockeys using Windows PCs -- which are so common in homes and workplaces as to be nearly ubiquitous.\n\nSo while Ives's enthusiasm is understandable given Apple's big AI lunge, at this point no one should be ready to award the company the gold medal. Generative AI takes some time to get the hang of, and to master, so I don't envision it being a sudden killer app. I also don't get the sense that most consumers are frothing at the mouth to have an AI phone. The tech is still relatively new, and even if many are aware of its potential, they might not find it sufficiently useful and applicable to their lives (at least, not yet).\n\nThat being said, AI will certainly be a draw to a segment of the iPhone user base and, to some degree, help attract new users. I think this demand is more likely to play out as an initial slow burn before advancing in a long-term rise; ditto for AI's impact on Apple's results and the popularity of its stock. So as a current Apple shareholder I'm encouraged by what AI might be able to do for its future. I'm just not ready to get overly excited about it at this early stage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia's AI Surge Powers 25% of S&P 500 Gains in 2024, Makes Co-founder Huang Among Fastest Growing: Report\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally disproportionately influences the S&P 500 index, reflecting concerns over the domino effect due to the integrated semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nNvidia accounted for 25% of the S&P 500’s 17% gain in 2024, Reuters reports.\n\nThe chip designer has risen by 166% in the last 12 months as Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), splurge on their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Gains Ground in AI Chip Market, Oracle Exec Confirms Growing Demand: Report\n\nThe rising valuation of NvidiaNVIDIA in 2024 has helped boost the wealth of Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of the company that was once created inside a Denny’s restaurant.\n\nHuang has a wealth of $90.5 billion, ranking 18th according to Bloomberg. While Huang hasn’t cracked the top 10 list yet and would currently need to hit a wealth of $130 billion, the Nvidia co-founder is one of the fastest risers among the world’s richest people. Huang’s wealth is up $46.4 billion year-to-date in 2024.\n\nThat figure is more than the combined $41.83 billion gained by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Musk, Bezos and Gates currently rank first, second and fifth, respectively, with their current wealth and year-to-date gains.\n\nElon Musk: $237 billion, +$7.73 billion year-to-date Jeff Bezos: $195 billion, +$17.9 billion year-to-date Bill Gates: $157 billion, +$16.2 billion year-to-date\n\nThe gain by Huang is one of the largest year-to-date gains, trailing only Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is up $49.9 billion and listed fourth at $178 billion.\n\nIt’s not just personal wealth – due to the AI frenzy, Huang expects hyper-scale customers to produce $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia’s infrastructure. He also reiterated that Blackwell-based products will ship in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia stock losing value would impact the S&P500 and Huang’s wealth. However, Huang had snubbed geopolitical tensions surrounding supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), voicing the possibility of switching suppliers.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia have a combined weighting of 20% in the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 31%, and Apple has risen 22% in the last 12 months as they remain invested in their AI goals.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia and the S&P 500 through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 1.95% to $116.78 on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s Strong August Sales Hint at Big Gains Ahead, AI and iPhone Demand Fuel Optimism\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Good Big Tech Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other big tech stocks.\n\nThe State of Big Tech Right Now\n\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\n\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of  AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\n\nHow Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors?\n\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\n\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\n\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an information technology company and the famed manufacturer of the iPhone. It is based in Cupertino, California.\n\nThis tech giant is by far the largest company in the world and has a reputation that transcends borders. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 was Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) best quarter in quite some time, with revenue growth year-over-year from products like the iPad coming in at 24%. However, many are disillusioned by this company because, despite its reputation, its growth is lagging behind many competitors in the tech space, particularly in terms of sales.\n\nThe hefty price tags that accompany any Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) product on the market may be the biggest reason why sales seem to be lagging. However, analysts expect the iPhone 16 to bring about a massive change because this new model actually gives users a reason to upgrade. With Apple Intelligence only being available on the latest iPhone models - the 15 and 16 series - now may be the time for Apple enthusiasts to trade up from older models.\n\nApple Intelligence introduces generative AI on the iOS user interface and marks the first major step Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has taken in the field of AI. This signals to investors that the iPhone maker may finally be catching up with other big tech stocks, a development that is expected to increase growth and profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had 184 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $124.2 billion.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple chief executive Tim Cook with the new iPhone 16 - David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\nApple saw more than $116bn (£88bn) wiped off its valuation in early trading after analysts warned about weaker than expected demand for its new iPhone as its push into artificial intelligence disappointed fans.\n\nShares in the world’s most-valuable company fell by 3.3pc after the assessment of pre-order sales of the new iPhone 16 series from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities.\n\nThe device will include artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as finding reviews and menus when pointing the camera at a restaurant, or identifying animals and plants.\n\nHowever, the tech giant said it will bring its Apple Intelligence AI to the US in the coming weeks - in what it describes as a “beta” - before launching a “localised” version for the UK in December.\n\nEuropean countries and other markets will have to wait until 2025.\n\nIn a note to clients, Mr Kuo wrote that iPhone 16 series first-weekend pre-order sales are estimated at about 37m units, which is down about 12.7pc from last year’s iPhone 15 series first-weekend sales.\n\nMr Kuo said: “One of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release.”\n\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said that while consumers continue to prefer Pro models, the orders for these flagship models are “starting off modestly slower vs. last year”.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:13 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today on the Markets blog.\n\nUS stock indexes are drifting near their records as Wall Street gears up for the most anticipated meeting of the Federal Reserve in years.\n\nThe S&P 500 is 0.1pc lower in trading after flitting between gains and losses earlier this afternoon. It’s sitting just 0.8pc below its all-time high set in July.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.3pc, after climbing above its record closing high earlier in the afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 0.8pc.\n\nWe will be back tomorrow morning, but in the meantime you can follow our latest business news here.\n\n05:45 PM BST\n\nBiden adviser says US has reached ‘turning point’ on economy\n\nTop White House economic adviser Lael Brainard declared in a speech this afternoon that the US economy has turned the corner in bringing down inflation. Now, she said, it is time to focus on safeguarding recent progress in the labour market.\n\nTwo days before the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates, Ms Brainard told a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York that inflation was returning to normal levels without the considerable job losses and growth slowdown that some had predicted.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe said:\n\nToday, we are at an important turning point. Inflation is coming back down close to normal levels, and it is important to safeguard the important labour market progress we have made.\n\nMs Brainard, the former Fed vice chair who now serves as the director of the White House National Economic Council, did not say what action the Fed should take on Wednesday, and her comments were in line with recent comments from Fed officials.\n\nBut she said President Joe Biden has emphasised the independence of the Fed, drawing a contrast with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s frequent criticism of Fed monetary policy decisions during his presidency.

Adam Mawardi reports:\n\nThe Mindful Business Charter (MBC), a mental health charity established to reduce unnecessary stress for staff, on Monday urged firms to check with lawyers at risk of overworking about how much rest and sleep they were getting.\n\nThe organisation said that law firms could detect which employees were vulnerable by introducing time tracking systems to alert bosses if employees were working long hours.\n\nMBC, founded in 2018, also advised law firms to check how these employees switched off from work and how much “meaningful contact” they got with emotional support outside of work.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:33 PM BST\n\nEuropean shares dip after tech shares lose ground\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed slightly lower this afternoon as losses in heavyweight technology shares weighed on the index.\n\nThe index ended 0.2pc lower.\n\nTech stocks in the index dropped 1.2pc, the biggest percentage decliner amongst major Stoxx sectors, following its near 5pc jump last week.\n\nRetail led advances with a 0.9pc rise, boosted by a 3.1pc increase in clothes chain H&M.\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nUnion attacks Labour over ‘industrial vandalism on a mass scale’\n\nThe Unite union has lashed out against Labour, which it helps fund, after the owner of Scotland’s Grangemouth oil refinery announced it would close.\n\nUnite, which represents the 500 oil refinery workers, has issued an angry press release saying that it “blasts government ministers over Grangemouth ‘false promises’ and ‘non-delivery’”.\n\nGeneral secretary of the union, Sharon Graham, said:\n\nScotland backed Labour at the ballot box but so far Labour has utterly failed to deliver for the Grangemouth workers when it needed them most. The SNP government has also shown itself to be irrelevant to the needs of working class communities. This is industrial vandalism on a mass scale.\n\nOver the last few days, our members have witnessed government ministers condescendingly speaking about ready-made jobs being available. It is fantasy talk from people who have no clue about the realities on the ground. We need urgent action to support the workers of today not just warm words from ministers about the projects of the future.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Scottish Government have been approached for comment.

He added:\n\nReintroducing the mandatory requirement to report corporate giving in annual reports should improve transparency around corporate giving, and the new Government can explore ways to encourage companies to commit to supporting the communities they are part of.\n\n04:54 PM BST\n\nFTSE closes up after uncertain day’s trading\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.1pc after sinking during morning trading and spending the day failing to gain momentum.\n\nThe top riser was JD Sports, up 3.6pc, followed by M&S, up 2.9pc. Pensions giant Phoenix fell 5.3pc, followed by aerospace business Melrose, down 3.6pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc. The top riser was Playtech, up 15.1pc, followed by TI Fluid Systems, up 14.1pc.\n\nTrustpilot was the biggest faller, down 3.7pc, followed by Oxford Instruments, down 3.6pc.\n\n04:43 PM BST\n\nBritain more attractive than EU rivals, says investment management giant\n\nInvestment giant Pimco has said that UK government debt is “very attractive”, compared with EU rivals, now that he country has put Liz Truss behind it.\n\nManny Roman, chief executive, told Bloomberg Television: “We like the UK and Australia. We think the UK fits very well.”\n\nPimco has more than $2 trillion (£1.5 trillion) invested globally.\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nBoeing imposes hiring freeze in bid to conserve cash after strike starts\n\nBoeing is pausing hiring and taking sweeping steps to conserve cash after about 33,000 workers went on strike on Friday.\n\nThese include considering temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks.\n\nBoeing’s finance chief Brian West said that the “strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future”.\n\nIn addition to a hiring freeze across Boeing at all levels, Reuters reported that the planemaker is stopping most staff travel, and suspending non-essential capital expenditures and facilities spending.#\n\nIt is also planning “significant reductions in supplier expenditures and will stop issuing the majority of supplier purchase orders on the 737, 767 and 777 programmes.” Boeing factory workers and supporters gather on a picket line during the third day of a strike near the entrance to a Boeing factory in Renton, Washington state, yesterday - David Ryder/Reuters\n\n04:21 PM BST\n\nEuro zone yields slip as markets increase bets on Fed rate cut\n\nEuro zone government bond yields slipped today as money markets increased their bets on a super-sized half a percentage point rate cut by the US Fed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will also hold their policy meetings later this week and are expected to keep rates at the current levels.\n\nMoney markets have fully priced in a quarter point rate cut from the US central bank and a nearly 60pc chance of a half point move, from around 50pc late last week, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nPaul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said:\n\nA rate cut of more than [a quarter of a percentage point] seems unlikely - while the Fed is late in cutting rates, a larger move might be taken as a sign of panic.\n\nHigher frequency cuts rather than larger cuts seem most likely.\n\nGermany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone bloc, was down at 2.12pc, from 2.15pc late on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, British 10-year gilt yields, which have been higher for most of today, are currently slighly down at 3.76pc from 3.77pc late on Friday.\n\n04:13 PM BST\n\nUS stocks mixed as markets brace for interest rate decision\n\nMajor American stock indexes are mixed this afternoon - and the dollar stayed soft against its global peers - as all eyes looked to a Federal Reserve meeting later this week.\n\nThe meeting is expected to usher in a hotly-anticipated easing cycle.\n\nExpectations have grown that the Federal Reserve could cut rates by as much as half a point this week.\n\nThe hope is that rate cuts will keep the world’s largest economy on course for a soft landing, while managing slowing jobs growth and moderating inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 top US companies is up 0.4pc, while the S&P 500 is down 0.2pc.\n\nTech stocks weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, where companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla dipped. The index is down 1pc.\n\nXTB research director Kathleen Brooks said markets would look past the size of any rate cut on Wednesday to understand the Fed’s rationale. She said:\n\nIf the Fed does start by cutting [by half a percentage point], but at the same time reiterates that it is doing so to preserve the economy’s soft landing, this is stock-market positive.\n\nIf it sounds like the Fed has to panic cut interest rates because of some grey cloud on the horizon, then expect stocks to sell off.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the US currencies against peers including the pound, the yen and the euro, fell 0.4pc.\n\n04:06 PM BST\n\nArgentina’s markets cheer Milei’s zero deficit budget\n\nArgentina’s sovereign bonds and stock index have climbed today, as investors cheered an ambitious 2025 budget plan from libertarian president Javier Milei.\n\nThe budget predicts robust growth and sticks to a “zero” fiscal deficit.\n\nOn Sunday Mr Milei had told Congress his 2025 budget would stick by his key pledge to establish a fiscal surplus and that he would veto any bills that threatened his zero deficit plan.\n\nMilei, a free-market economist, has taken tough austerity measures to overturn years of fiscal deficits, tackle rampant inflation and stabilize the economy. He has called a balanced budget non-negotiable.\n\nThe draft budget foresees the economy expanding 5pc in 2025, inflation dropping from over 250pc now to some 18pc by the end of next year, and the exchange rate weakening to 1,207 pesos per dollar by end-2025 from 960 per dollar now.\n\nArgentina’s flagship Merval stock index is up 1.2pc. Argentine president Javier Milei delivers a speech during the Americas Society/Council of the Americas conference in Buenos Aires on Aug 14 - Juan Mabromata/AFP via Getty Images\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nIntel jumps on reports of US government contracts\n\nIntel shares are up 4.5pc this afternoon after a report that the chipmaker has qualified for up to $3.5bn in US government grants.\n\nBloomberg said that the handout, part of a secretive programme called Secure Enclave, is to support Intel making cutting-edge chips for the US Department of Defense.\n\nSecure Enclave is designed to curb America’s reliance on foriegn semiconductor suppliers.\n\n03:48 PM BST\n\nFormer civil service boss to oversee BT’s fightback against price controls\n\nOne of the UK’s former top civil servants has joined BT’s board to oversee the telecoms giant’s fight against broadband price controls. James Warrington reports:\n\nSir Alex Chisholm, who served as chief operating officer of the civil service and Permanent Secretary for the Cabinet Office until earlier this year, has joined BT’s board as a non-executive director.\n\nHe will take up a newly created position overseeing BT’s relationship with regulator Ofcom.\n\nIt comes as Ofcom kicks off a major review of the wholesale broadband market that will set regulations for the next five years. The report, dubbed the Telecoms Access Review, is expected to examine the fees BT charges to internet service providers such as Sky and TalkTalk for the use of its network.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n03:46 PM BST\n\nApple Watch gains approval for sleep apnea detection - half a year after Samsung\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has given approval for a sleep apnea detection on the latest Apple Watches.\n\nSleep apnea is when someone’s breathing stops and starts while they sleep.\n\nThe new Series 9 and 10 watches, along with the Ultra 2, will offer functionality.\n\nThe approval comes after Samsung secured it for its Galaxy Watch range in February. Series 10 Apple Watches on display during an event at Apple’s HQ in Cupertino, California, on Sept 9 - David Paul Morris/Bloomberg\n\n03:31 PM BST\n\nPound rises as Bank of England expected to hold rates steady\n\nThe pound has continued to push higher as traders bet that the Bank of England will hold interest rates steady this week.\n\nSterling was up 0.6pc to more than $1.32 as money markets indicate that by contrast to Britain’s central bank, the US Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday.\n\nPeder Beck-Friis, economist at investment manager Pimco, said:\n\nWe believe the Bank of England is likely to maintain its policy rate at 5pc in the upcoming meeting on Thursday, unless inflation surprises significantly to the downside on Wednesday.\n\nThe August rate cut was a narrow call, and the BoE has not adopted as dovish a stance as other central banks. The market currently prices a 20pc chance of a cut this week.\n\nWe expect the next cut in November, with faster cuts thereafter. The global pandemic-related sugar rush has now faded, and recent developments reinforce our conviction that inflation will continue to decline.\n\nWith that, I will bid you good day and leave you in the ever-eager hands of Alex Singleton, who will post the live updates from here.\n\n03:15 PM BST\n\nElectric battery maker will not receive government rescue\n\nEurope’s leading battery maker will not receive government investment despite announcing plans to slash jobs and scale back its commitments, the Sweish prime minister has said.\n\nNorthvolt, the Swedish company which raised £10bn to challenge China’s dominance of batteries, last week pledged to refocus efforts on improving its struggling factory in Skellefteå and cutting costs.\n\nThe news that it will carry out “a re-scope of operations and appropriate resizing of our workforce” sparked fears that Europe’s best shot at a home-grown electric vehicle battery champion may stall.\n\nThe company, which counts German car giants BMW and Volkswagen among its backers, has been seeking investment from outside partners in its energy storage business.\n\nHowever Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a press conference: “There is no doubt that we are committed to Sweden being a good place for new technology that is needed in the green transition, but it is not relevant for the Swedish state to step in and take a stake.”\n\nIts plans to scale back investment come as Volkswagen warned that it could be forced to close a factory in Germany for the first time and make large cost savings as it manages the transition away from petrol cars. Northvolt’s gigafactory in Skellefteå in Sweden\n\n02:58 PM BST\n\nApple shares slump as Wall Street wavers\n\nUS stock markets wavered as investors cautiously awaited the US Federal Reserve’s first interest-rate cut since 2020.\n\nIn New York, the Dow Jones Industrial was up but the wider S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were lower shortly after opening.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was marginally higher but all the main European exchanges were slightly lower.\n\nInvestors widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time since March 2020.

S&P 500 futures were little changed, while Nasdaq futures dipped 0.1pc..\n\nCentral banks in Japan and the UK also meet this week, with both expected to stand pat for now, while a packed data schedule includes US retail sales and industrial production.",

        "title": "Analyst Says Donald Trump’s China Tariffs Plan Could Impact Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.\n\nLee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\n“ A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it’s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it’s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative,” Lee said.\n\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nBarclays recently published a list of stocks that could be impacted if Donald Trump comes to power and implements his tariffs plan against China. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was part of the list. Barclays said it chose these stocks “based on a bottom-up approach, using factual input on global supply chain exposure.”\n\nApple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone event went more or less as expected and all eyes are now on pre-order data and actual numbers on the new iPhone. A survey by US AlphaWise showed about 60% of customers planning to upgrade their iPhone said Apple Intelligence is a key part of the rationale behind the upgrade.\n\nAlmost all bull cases around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are based on the assumption that millions of people would upgrade their iPhones mainly due to AI. However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. shares fell Monday after a closely followed analyst warned that demand for the firm’s new iPhone 16 Pro model has been lower than expected.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine'\n\nPre-order sales, which began Friday for the phone, have tallied an estimated 37 million units, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report. That’s down almost 13% from last year’s iPhone 15 launch and is a result of weaker-than-anticipated interest in the Pro model of the iPhone 16, says Kuo.\n\n“One of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release,” Kuo said in the report.\n\nAfter a weak start to the year, shares in the company rallied the past four months as investors bet Apple’s AI features would boost sales of its latest line of iPhones. They slumped about 3% to start Monday trading, paring their gain this year to roughly 12%, trailing the 15% advance in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nAnalysts were largely underwhelmed after the company’s launch event last week as most of the hardware announcements were leaked beforehand. Looking past the launch event, Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring noted last week that attention will turn to “early iPhone 16 pre-order and lead time data that we will start to collect this Friday.”\n\nThe demand weakness for the iPhone 16 is not a good sign, “particularly since we’re heading into the holiday selling season soon,” said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. The risk of a “meaningful decline” in the shares has “risen in a material way.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple AirPods 4 review: Still the top choice for a reason",
        "content": "I spend the vast majority of my workday listening to music on my AirPods Pro 2. It’s the only way I can concentrate on researching and writing. But at $249, the AirPods Pro 2 are a pricey proposition. Which is where Apple’s (AAPL) AirPods 4 come in. An updated version of Apple’s entry-level and mid-range AirPods, the AirPods 4 come in two flavors: a $129 base model and a $179 version with active noise cancellation. We’ll refer to that one as \"AirPods 4 with ANC.\"\n\nI’ve been using both models of AirPods 4 for the past week or so, and so far, I've found them to be far more comfortable than their predecessors, slotting easily into my ears and staying put whether I’m out for a run or cooking dinner, and the audio quality is top-notch for wireless earbuds.\n\nBetween the two models, I’d opt for the AirPods 4 with ANC; they pack more features and offer a shockingly similar experience to the AirPods Pro 2, though they lack the Pro 2's silicone tips that help block ambient noise. But if you’re in the market for the most affordable option, the standard AirPods 4 are still a solid choice.\n\nNew look, more features\n\nThe AirPods 4 line offers an updated design that Apple says it’s refined using years of data to ensure a snug fit whether you opt for the base model or ANC version. I like the AirPods Pro 2 design, but some users, including my wife, have trouble with the way the changeable silicone tips sit in their ears. The AirPods 4 with ANC should solve that problem, providing noise-cancelling tech without the need for tips. Apple's AirPods 4 sport an improved design and updated audio capabilities. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nBoth versions of the AirPods 4 get voice isolation for better-sounding phone calls and Siri Interactions, which allow you to approve or dismiss things like notifications and phone calls by shaking your head up and down for yes or side to side for no. In my testing I had to be fairly deliberate with my movements, so there’s no way I could do this discreetly on the subway without people thinking I’m having an argument with myself. Still, I can see how this could be helpful if I were out for a run or lifting weights and wanted to dismiss or accept a call or notification.\n\nApple says the machine learning algorithm that enables Siri Interactions, which is powered by the company’s H2 chip, should pick up on how you move your head over time, letting you more subtly accept or reject calls.\n\nBoth AirPods 4 models also come with Apple’s Personalized Volume, which automatically adjusts the volume of what you’re listening to depending on what’s happening around you. So if you’re in a quiet library, Personalized Volume will lower the sound, but if you’re in a crowded room, it will raise it. I usually switch this off since I want to be able to control the volume myself, regardless of where I am.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AirPods 4 also come with Apple’s Force sensor, which allows you to pinch the AirPods’ stems to pause and play music, answer calls, skip and rewind tracks, mute and unmute calls, and call upon Siri. You can also bring up the virtual assistant to do things like message or call people by saying “Hey, Siri” or just “Siri.” You don’t, however, get the AirPods Pro 2's swipe controls that let you to raise and lower the volume by sliding your fingers up or down their stems. The AirPods 4 with ANC come with a wireless charging case. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nApple’s AirPods 4 with ANC use internal and external microphones and speakers to drown out environmental noise. I wore the AirPods 4 with ANC on a cross-country flight on my way from Apple’s Sept. 9 iPhone event in Cupertino, Calif., to New York and was surprised at just how well the earbuds blocked out ambient cabin sounds and engine noise.\n\nIt felt as though I was using the AirPods Pro 2 I normally wear on flights. That said, Apple specifically explains that the AirPods 4 with ANC are meant to block out low-frequency sounds, not high-frequency noises like a crying baby in the row behind you. That’s where the AirPods Pro 2’s silicone tips come in handy.\n\nLike the AirPods Pro 2, the AirPods 4 with ANC also get Apple’s Transparency mode, which amplifies environmental sounds, so you can hear what’s going on around you while still listening to music or a podcast. Unlike the Pro 2s, however, the AirPods 4 with ANC won’t include Apple’s upcoming hearing aid feature.\n\nBattery and charging\n\nApple rates the AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC’s battery life at five hours on a single charge. That drops to four hours if you have ANC active on the AirPods 4 with ANC. That’s lower than the six hours the company promised with its third-generation AirPods, but the same as the second-generation AirPods. The charging case gets you the same 30 hours of listening time as the third-gen AirPods.\n\nThat said, I wore the AirPods with ANC turned on for my roughly five-and-a-half-hour coast-to-coast flight, and while they called it quits before I landed, they certainly lasted more than four hours.\n\nBoth AirPods 4 models support Apple’s Find My, which lets you locate your devices on a map if you misplace them, but only the ANC model includes a built-in speaker that will play a tone to alert you when they're nearby. Apple says a five-minute charge in the case adds an hour to listening time for both pairs of earbuds.\n\nStill the go-to\n\nFrom their fit to their ease of use, Apple’s AirPods 4 are still some of my favorite earbuds around. If you’re the type of person that isn’t doing much commuting or doesn’t tend to listen to music in loud areas, the base AirPods 4 are the version for you. But if you’re going to be in a noisy office or ride the bus, train, or fly often, the model with ANC is the way to go.\n\nIf you’re looking for a bit more out of your earbuds, though, including improved noise cancellation and the ability to use them as hearing aids, then you’ll need to opt for the AirPods Pro 2. Either way, if you’re an Apple user, you can’t go wrong. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's Investable Portfolio in 1 Incredibly Safe Bet",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, and he has the track record to justify that view.\n\nBetween when he took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965 and the end of last year, it produced compound annualized returns of 19.8% for shareholders. That's nearly twice the 10.2% average total return of the S&P 500 in that time. But it's when that growth rate gets compounded over time -- 58 years in this case -- that the performance gap becomes truly remarkable. Over that span, Berkshire's total return has been 140 times that of the index.\n\nSo, when Buffett makes changes in Berkshire's investment portfolio, the whole investing world pays attention. And he has been rapidly amassing a position in one super-safe investment -- a position that is approaching 50% of the company's entire investment portfolio. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBuffett's biggest bets\n\nBuffett has never been one to shy away from investing a lot of money into a single idea.\n\nFor example, he put a lot of money into Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) between 2016 and 2018, spending around $36 billion on that stock over the period. At one point, Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake grew to become about 50% of its equity portfolio, but Buffett has been selling the stock lately. His $75 billion sale of Apple stock during the second quarter cut Berkshire's remaining position nearly in half.\n\nBuffett's stated reasoning for that move was that he wanted to take advantage of the current corporate tax rate. Under the 2017 tax law that cut corporate tax rates to their current level, the cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, so he naturally expects them to increase in 2026 and beyond. But Buffett's decision to trim his Apple stake also suggests he views the shares as fairly valued or at best, only slightly undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. It wouldn't make sense to sell an asset well below its value to save on taxes.\n\nAnother big Berkshire stock holding is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Buffett acquired the stake in Bank of America through warrants he acquired by investing in preferred shares of the stock in 2011. That allowed him to buy a lot of common stock in 2017 at the bargain price of $7.14 per share. He then proceeded to add onto that holding.\n\nAlthough Bank of America was once Buffett's second-largest holding, he's started selling shares of it too. Since the start of the third quarter, he's sold $7.2 billion worth of the bank stock. His reasoning appears to be the same as his reasoning behind Apple: Better to pay the taxes on Berkshire's profits now before the current low corporate tax rate expires. For reference, Buffett's average selling price for Bank of America stock recently has been more than $40 per share, nearly six times what he paid for it.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple and Bank of America aren't the only stocks Buffett's been selling recently. In fact, he's sold more stock than he bought in each of the past seven quarters, and based on his Bank of America sales in Q3, it looks like it will soon officially be two full years of consistent net selling for Buffett.\n\nBut he has to do something with the proceeds of all those stock sales. And Buffett has been piling the money into a super safe investment that's approaching 50% of his total investment portfolio.\n\nBuffett's $300 billion bet\n\nAs Buffett sells stocks, he's been putting the funds into a very specific investment: short-term Treasury bills. These are Treasury bonds that mature within one year. Buffett prefers those maturing within six months or less. Through the first six months of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway padded its Treasury holdings by $94 billion.\n\nThe company held a total of $277 billion in Treasury bills and cash as of the end of the second quarter. Even as Buffett has sold shares, Berkshire's core operations continue to produce operating cash flow of roughly $12 billion to $13 billion each quarter. On top of that, Berkshire will collect roughly $3.5 billion in interest from the Treasuries it already holds. Add it all up, and Berkshire's position in short-term Treasury bills is rapidly approaching $300 billion (assuming Buffett hasn't found a great company to buy in the last 2 1/2 months).\n\nFor reference, based on publicly available reports, Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth just over $300 billion as of this writing. That means Buffett's Treasury position could be almost half of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\n\nIt's important to note Buffett prefers short-term Treasury bills; he won't invest in longer-dated government bonds. \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire's latest quarterly report. Bonds with longer maturities usually provide higher yields, but come with more interest-rate risk. If market rates increase, the values of those bonds will decrease more than shorter maturity securities.\n\nBuffett has been getting the best of both worlds recently. The inverted yield curve led to higher yields for short-term bonds compared to long-term bonds. But with the Federal Reserve set to start lowering interest rates shortly, short-term yields should fall faster than long-term yields, ultimately resulting in much less interest income for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWhile Buffett suggested he's fine with holding hundreds of billions in Treasuries right now regardless of yield during Berkshire's shareholder meeting earlier this year, he may find alternatives more attractive as rates come down.\n\nShould you follow Buffett?\n\nBuffett is in charge of a $1 trillion conglomerate with investable assets that exceed $600 billion -- even more if you include the insurance float available to him for investment. The number of investments that could meaningfully move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway is relatively small.\n\nOn that score, the average retail investor is in a much more advantageous position. The entire investment universe is at their disposal. Buffett's actions and asset allocation suggest there aren't as many bargains in the stock market as there once were, but there are still plenty of great stocks to buy in the current environment.\n\nAlthough the yield on cash savings right now may be more attractive than it has been in a long time, long-term investments in stocks have consistently produced the highest returns. Trying to time the market and pick just the right time to deploy a lot of cash is not a feat most individual investors should attempt. Even Buffett suggests that people should add to their investments during every market environment (bullish or bearish), spreading out their stock buys over time, and remaining consistent with their purchases.\n\nIt can sometimes be hard to resist the temptation to follow Buffett's lead, but it's important to remember that he's playing a slightly different game than the average investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

How much will the iPhone 16 cost? iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro release date What about the Apple Watch and AirPods?\n\nIts latest gadgets are geared to take advantage of the tech giant’s AI software, known as Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis is powered by new A18 and A18 Pro microchip processors, which analysts hope will trigger a surge in sales.\n\n“The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. It marks the beginning of an exciting new era,” Apple boss Tim Cook said.\n\nIt came on the same day that Chinese rival Huawei unofficially announced a new tri-fold phone.\n\nThe Chinese company’s website showed that it had garnered more than 3m pre-orders for its Z-shaped phone. This solidifies Huawei’s position against Apple in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them.\n\n“The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the US market,” said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, said. For Apple, “it will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they’ll be going off the merits of the hardware.”\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Apple’s new launches:\n\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro: features\n\nApple unveiled four new iPhone 16 models. This includes the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 16 introduces new colours, while the the Pro versions will include a more advanced A18 Pro chip. The new Apple iPhone 16 unveiled on September 9, 2024 - Nic Coury/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe standard version of the Apple iPhones will come in ultramarine, teal, pink, while and black, and with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screens.\n\nThe premium versions of Apple’s iPhones will come in black, white, silver and desert colours. They come with 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The larger of these being Apple’s largest-ever phone display, a step up from its former 6.7-inch screen.\n\nThe gadgets will look broadly similar to other iPhones of recent years. The iPhone 16 models will come with a dual rear camera and the Pro variant with a triple rear set-up.\n\nHowever, all the phones will come with a new “capture” or “camera” button that will act similar to a shutter button on a regular camera – with added touch and swipe functions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe phones will also include a programmable action button, which can be linked to quick-launch different features.\n\nWhat is Apple Intelligence and when will it be released?\n\nThe tech giant will bring its Apple Intelligence AI to the US in October - in what it describes as a “beta” - before launching a “localised” version for the UK in December.\n\nThe new software will include a revamped Siri digital assistant and a host of writing tools.\n\nThis will include AI-powered features that can reply to emails, draft blog posts and presentations, create synthetic artwork and design customised emojis.\n\nApple Intelligence will also grant users access to ChatGPT, the digital assistant from Silicon Valley start-up OpenAI.\n\nApple has previously said: “Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.”\n\nHow much will the iPhone 16 cost?\n\nThe iPhone 16 will cost £799, while the iPhone 16 Plus will cost £899.\n\nThe higher-end iPhone 16 Pro starts at £999, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max comes in at £1,199.\n\nThe prices are the same in pounds as they are in dollars for the US market. The iPhone is typically more expensive in the UK owing to taxes and exchange rates.\n\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro release date\n\nApple has announced that the new iPhone 16 was available for pre-order in the US and UK from Friday Sept 13, and will then go on full sale a week later on Sept 20.\n\nHowever, some of the crucial new software features may not be available immediately, with Apple Intelligence available in the UK in December.\n\nWhat about the Apple Watch and AirPods?\n\nApple is releasing a new low-end version of its AirPod headphones, the AirPods 4, at a cost of £129, or £179 with noise cancellation.\n\nThe new AirPods 4 have a new design for more comfortable wearing and improved acoustics. The new Apple AirPods Max are displayed during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters - Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, the premium AirPods Pro will now be able to carry out a hearing test. The iPhone will play a series of sounds, asking you to tap the screen when you hear a tone.\n\nApple also debuted a revamped version of its larger, over-ear headphones, known as the AirPods Max.\n\nThe new Apple Watch 10 was also launched, thinner than its predecessor and has an up to 30pc larger screen than previous generations. It starts at £399.

The Bank of England is set to announce its interest rate decision on Thursday, with markets betting on Threadneedle Street holding the bank rate at 5% following a quarter point rate cut in August. US stock futures are cautiously lower following their best week in months. The US Federal Reserve will announce its next monetary policy decision on Wednesday. Markets are largely split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points to a range of 5.0% to 5.25% or by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. Friday saw a significant jump in expectations for a 50 basis point cut, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

(Photo by Carlos Escalona/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nHere's commentary from Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer of Zaye Capital Markets:\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring the attempted assassination of Trump in the context of politics and US elections. While the market has kept its cool, there's an undercurrent of 'waiting for the other shoe to drop'. The fact that the event didn't cause massive chaos, as it would have if the former president had sustained injuries, has undoubtedly reassured traders. However, the event has certainly created a sense of unease, as this is the second assassination attempt on Trump, and many have started to question what this all means for the US in terms of political stability. Political stability is now the elephant in the room, and it's making traders nervous. Mon 16 September 2024 at 12:17 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nHow US stocks are faring in premarket Mon 16 September 2024 at 12:16 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nLast week in the US\n\nFrom my US colleagues:\n\nStocks managed to secure solid wins ahead of a critical monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve, which has investors on edge over how aggressively the central bank will bring down interest rates.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led markets higher to nab its best week of the year, up about 6%. That weekly best was echoed by the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), which saw an uptick of 4% as both gauges notched their fifth straight day of gains on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also ended the week in the green, up around 3%.\n\nThe positive swings come as traders have flip-flopped on whether the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points or opt for a more robust 50 basis point cut at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. No matter the size, it will be the first rate cut from the Fed since early 2020.\n\nFormer New York Fed president Bill Dudley said there's a \"strong case\" for a deeper cut as FOMC members attempt to maneuver a \"soft landing\" of the economy. That, along with reports from the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal that suggested policymakers were struggling to come to a decision, have fueled expectations for a jumbo rate cut. Mon 16 September 2024 at 12:14 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nGood morning!\n\nHello from London. Feels like markets have gone back to school, with an important week for central banks ahead of us.\n\nWednesday will bring a decision from the Federal Reserve in the US — traders are pricing in a rate cut, the magnitude of which is still being debated. Some think. a jumbo 50 basis points rate cut could be on the table rather than 25.\n\nMidday on Thursday is also the Bank of England's rate announcement. The bank rate is expected to be left at 5% after a quarter point rate cut in August.\n\nIn terms of earnings today, Darktrace will post its full-year update.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘There’s No Smartphone Monopoly, So How Can There Be Monopolistic Behavior?’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there’s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he’s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it’s worth paying attention to what’s going right.\n\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I’m willing to declare that there’s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I’m not trying to call a bottom, let’s make that crystal clear, but I think it’s worth taking a hard look at what’s actually going right—not just what’s going wrong.\"\n\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it’s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn’t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\n\"Sure, the market’s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren’t even oversold yet—at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there’s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don’t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\n\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve’s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let’s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That’s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won’t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it’s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"But let’s be realistic: You can’t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there’s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn’t cut rates when business is booming. That’s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday’s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can’t have it both ways.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to release a new phone, which Cramer believes will be impressive. However, he questioned whether the Justice Department might argue that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new success could give it too much bargaining power over app developers.\n\n\"On September 3rd, 2020, Apple lost $180 billion in market cap, but it soared 83% versus the S&P's 60% gain.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), is about to unveil a new phone that should be fabulous. But maybe it'll be too fabulous for the Justice Department? They might argue that Apple’s success could give it even more bargaining power over app developers if this phone is that good. But there are plenty of strong competitors to Apple. If you don’t like Apple, you can just buy a Samsung. There’s no smartphone monopoly, so how can there be monopolistic behavior?\"\n\nIn Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) achieved record revenues of $85.78 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year, driven by a strong 14% rise in services revenue, which hit an all-time high of $24.21 billion. This growth highlights the success of key services like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store, showcasing Apple's resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s net income also grew nearly 8% year-over-year to $21.45 billion, with earnings per share reaching $1.40, surpassing analysts' expectations. Despite a slight decline in iPhone sales, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s wearables, home, and accessories segment continued to perform well, contributing $8.4 billion in revenue. Additionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s gross margin improved to 44.5%, reflecting effective cost management and operational efficiency.\n\nRecent innovations, including the iPhone 15 with new features and the upcoming Vision Pro AR/VR headset, demonstrate Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s ongoing commitment to technological advancement\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks to Buy",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Warren Buffett dividend stocks.\n\nAlthough the financial world is often seen as serious and analytical, short selling introduces an element of excitement and complexity to market dynamics. Short selling is a strategy where investors borrow shares of a stock, anticipating that the market price will drop by the time they need to purchase the shares to return them. While many short sellers have scaled back since the meme stock frenzy began, the strategy of betting against stocks remains in practice. Short sellers saw strong gains in the second quarter of this year, successfully betting against stocks despite the broader market's upward trend. Data from S3 Partners LLC showed they earned $10 billion in paper profits during the quarter. These gains, driven by sectors like industrials, healthcare, and financials, helped offset a $15.7 billion mark-to-market loss in the technology sector.\n\nThe fact that short sellers were able to profit while the market was rising suggests that investors are concentrating on a handful of large-cap tech stocks amid an uncertain economic environment, leaving vulnerabilities in other sectors. During the quarter ending June 28, the broader market gained roughly 4%. Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index saw a 7.8% gain over the same period.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Worst Booming Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers\n\nIt's clear that short sellers capitalize on overlooked or troubled areas of the market. Last year, the turmoil in regional banks attracted short sellers, who stirred controversy by examining lenders' balance sheets for vulnerabilities linked to rising interest rates and betting against their stocks. In 2023, while the broader market rallied, this sector became a key area of success for these traders. The volatility that affected regional bank stocks earlier this year again generated substantial paper profits for short sellers, echoing the gains they made during last year's upheaval in the sector. Now analysts are viewing short sellers in a completely new perspective. Carson Block, the founder of Muddy Waters Research, is convinced that markets need short sellers more than ever. However, he notes that a persistent stock rally and new regulatory challenges are creating difficulties for his bearish colleagues, who are struggling to secure capital. Here are some comments from the investor:\n\n“It’s easy to demonize short sellers as part of a populist message and somehow call us the suits. The market needs short sellers more than ever given the amount of games that are being played, but if the long-side doesn’t care, this can continue — until it doesn’t.”\n\nAlongside Block, numerous respected investors and experts have emphasized that short selling plays a crucial role in public markets. It helps enhance price accuracy, ensures better capital allocation, prevents financial bubbles, and uncovers fraud. In 2006, during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett highlighted that financially strong companies could benefit from short sellers, as they eventually have to buy back the stock. He believes short sellers often uncover wrongdoing or suspicious activities. Buffett remarked that there is nothing inherently wrong with short selling, noting that in many cases where there has been significant short interest, the companies involved were later exposed as fraudulent or engaging in questionable practices. With this, we will take a look at some of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks according to short sellers.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first scanned Berkshire Hathaway’s 13F portfolio as of Q2 2024 and identified dividend stocks from the list. From that list, we shortlisted dividend companies with the lowest percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short as of September 15 and ranked them in descending order of the stocks’ short interest.\n\nWe also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 912 funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.89%\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, short sellers faced significant losses, losing billions of dollars by betting against major, well-known stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was among the three least profitable short positions during this period, as its stock price jumped by 23% in Q2 2024. According to analysts, weak iPhone sales and regulatory challenges in the EU and the USA may be affecting sentiment, but the influence of market perceptions on interest rate trends should not be overlooked either.\n\nIn fiscal Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a 14.5% QoQ decline in its iPhone sales at over $39.2 billion. The company's overall revenue for the quarter came in at $85.7 billion, which saw a 5% hike from the same period last year. During the quarter, the company was pleased to reveal significant updates to its software platforms at the Worldwide Developers Conference. Among these updates was Apple Intelligence, a revolutionary personal intelligence system that integrates advanced, private generative AI models into iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices. Despite its declining iPhone sales, analysts are still optimistic about the company. Baron Funds also discussed this in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also reported a strong cash position. The company generated over $29 billion in operating cash flow and returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Moreover, the company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 12 years, which makes AAPL one of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks. Its quarterly dividend currently sits at $0.25 per share for a dividend yield of 0.45%, as of September 15.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) garnered a lot of attention from elite money managers during the second quarter of 2024. Insider Monkey's database of Q2 2024 indicated that 184 hedge funds held stakes in the company, growing from 150 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $124 billion.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Magnificent Seven is less expensive. Buying these tech giants now could pay off",
        "content": "Warren Buffett once said it can pay “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”\n\nSince the GenAI boom took hold last year, investors have hopped on the bandwagon of the Magnificent Seven—a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—and the group accounted for half the S&P 500’s total gains in 2023, according to a report from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAfter a blistering start to 2024, however, many of these large-cap tech giants have fallen back down to Earth. Could it be time to buy the dip? Here are three members of the Magnificent Seven that Wall Street remains high on.\n\nApple\n\nSpeaking of Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha made plenty of headlines when the Berkshire Hathaway chairman sold half of its immense holding of Apple stock. It’s worth noting, however, that the iPhone maker remains Berkshire’s biggest equity holding overall.\n\nSome believe the stock, which is up 20% year to date, is overvalued. Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, understands why Monday’s unveiling of the iPhone 16—the first with significant GenAI features—didn't spark a major reaction from investors. Nonetheless, he remains excited about the future of Apple’s wearables as new healthcare features are added, from sleep apnea detection on the Apple Watch to \"clinical grade\" hearing aids with the new AirPods Pro.\n\n“Some of this wearable stuff is kind of being not talked about enough,” Zino said, “maybe because the AI stuff is taking all the limelight.”\n\nThe stock closed at $222.50 Friday, with the Street’s consensus price target sitting just short of $250.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500’s total returns during the first half the year and is up almost 150% year to date. Analysts have made clear investors should not expect the chip designer’s shares to continue appreciating at the same pace, but the recent sell-off may have presented an attractive entry point.\n\nNvidia’s breakneck growth will inevitably slow, but demand for its GPUs remains insatiable. The stock popped over 13% this week as CEO Jensen Huang spoke Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs conference about juggling customers' needs, underlining why the company is still, as Zino put it, the “center of the universe” when it comes to AI.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to no one, he said, that the tech giants, as well as smaller customers, hungrily await Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. That may be one reason the stock, which closed just above $119 on Friday, has a consensus price target topping $153.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nHowever, the most underweighted mega-cap name, Zino said, is likely Alphabet, with the Google parent’s shares down 5% this month and up only 13.5% year to date, trailing the broader market.\n\nA federal judge recently ruled Google had illegally monopolized the search market, which Bernstein analysts said could unleash future litigation that could cost the company over $100 billion. The Justice Department is even reportedly considering an effort to break up the business.\n\nIn recent notes to inventors, however, Zino said he believes those concerns are already discounted in the stock price. Investors are under-appreciating Google’s AI monetization opportunities, he said, as well as assets like Waymo, Google’s autonomous driving technology.\n\nOn Friday, Uberannounced it will dispatch Waymo’s robotaxis in Austin and Atlanta by early 2025, expanding the footprint of Google’s self-driving cars beyond California and Arizona. Google shares closed above the $158 mark Friday, still below its consensus price target of roughly $204.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘One Of The Greatest Wealth Creators Of All Time’",
        "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List: 10 Stocks to Monitor Closely. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the risks of straying too far from technology stocks, particularly the dominant tech companies, in today’s market. He pointed out how JP Morgan, despite being one of the best-performing banks, caused a stir by cutting its forecast, warning that estimates might be overly optimistic. This news hurt the broader market, dropping it by 93 points, although the S&P 500 saw a slight rise of 0.54%, and the tech-driven NASDAQ gained 0.84%.\n\n“In this market, every time you stray too far from technology, especially the tech titans, you ultimately get slapped in the face by reality. That’s what happened today when the largest, and arguably best-performing, bank in the world, laid a huge egg with its forecast. They told us the estimates are too high, maybe way too high. That spoiled a big chunk of the market, ultimately dipping 93 points. The S&P inched up 0.54%, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ still gained 0.84%.”\n\nCramer explained that since the Federal Reserve gave positive signals, investors had shifted away from tech into other areas of the market. This shift was part of the “broadening out” that many investors had been waiting for, as it was believed to signal a healthier market. Financial stocks, which make up around 13.3% of the S&P 500, had been a source of excitement for those tired of relying on the leading tech stocks.\n\n“For the past couple of months, ever since the Fed gave us the all-clear signal, we’ve seen money flow out of tech into long-neglected regions of the stock market. This is the fabled “broadening out” that people spent all year clamoring for. When we bring in more groups of winners, we’re supposed to have a much healthier market, at least that’s what they say. There are tons of financials in the S&P 500, about 13.3% of the index and the strength in those stocks was a source of much joy for everyone who had gotten sick of The Magnificent Seven.”\n\nHowever, as Cramer noted, economic uncertainty and disappointing forecasts from bank companies disrupted this broader market strength. Daniel Pinto, the bank company’s COO, dashed hopes by signaling that the outlook for the bank wasn’t as strong as expected. The key issue was that net interest income, a critical measure for banks, was projected to miss expectations due to reduced capital market activity. For Cramer, this underperformance highlighted the danger of moving away from tech stocks too soon.\n\n“But a funny thing happened on the way to that broadened-out market: we got economic choppiness. Or to use a more accurate phrase, we got guide-downs that were intolerable to any of the leaders, and the kiss of death to the stock of the bank. You can’t be a leader when you’re slashing your forecast for H2. That’s when the shareholders kick you to the curb and find someone new to follow.\n\nBut today, Daniel Pinto, the bank’s President and Chief Operating Officer, lowered the boom on the optimists who desperately wanted to buy something other than tech. The big bank told us that things are less bullish than we thought. There isn’t as much capital markets activity as we’d hoped this quarter, and most importantly, the estimates for next year are too high because of a likely miss on net interest income.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Jim Cramer’s Exclusive Stock to Monitor Closely?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer believes that Wall Street is underestimating the significance of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 launch. He points out that previous iPhone models have also faced initial criticism, but have ultimately proven successful. Cramer emphasizes that the incremental improvements in the iPhone 16 contribute to increased usage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s services, a growing revenue stream that will eventually surpass the iPhone. While customer reaction to the new phone is uncertain, Cramer believes that the improvements will be highly valued by millions of users, making Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a strong long-term investment.\n\n“Wall Street doesn’t seem too excited about the launch of the Apple Inc. iPhone 16 yesterday, but let me tell you something about this product. Every iPhone has been criticized as a disappointment at launch, except for the first couple of models. Every iPhone supposedly offers only incremental improvements. Don’t bother reading the reviews. That’s what they’ll tell you every single time…\n\nAs an Apple aficionado, I want to point out that all of these improvements mean a step up in how many people use Apple’s Services. This is the important revenue stream because one day it will surpass the iPhone as the dominant earnings driver. The service revenue stream is often overlooked, even though it’s becoming a larger and larger part of the puzzle…\n\nWe don’t really know how customers will react to the new phone. It’s always been guesswork. But what isn’t guesswork is that these incremental improvements are astonishing features to tens or even hundreds of millions of people. That’s what keeps you owning and not trading the stock of Apple Inc., one of the greatest wealth creators of all time.”\n\nThe positive outlook for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is based on its strong growth potential, despite some short-term challenges. Although iPhone 15 sales in China have been weak, analysts expect a significant upgrade cycle, with anticipation for over 270 million units, especially as the iPhone 16 nears its 2025 release. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s services segment, including the App Store, is thriving, with Q1 2024 revenue reaching a record $23.1 billion and showing strong double-digit growth.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also advancing in artificial intelligence, integrating AI into products like the iPhone 16 and the Vision Pro headset, which positions Apple as a leader in AI innovation. Despite some difficulties in hardware sales, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s resilient gross margins and strong profitability from its services support its financial stability.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago…” (Click here to read more)\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of exclusive stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks to Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other consumer electronic stocks.\n\nThe global consumer electronics market has been experiencing significant growth, driven by rapid technological advancements and evolving consumer lifestyles. In 2024, the market reached an impressive valuation of $755 billion, with projections indicating it could soar to $1.15 trillion by 2031 (as per estimates by Research and Markets). This upward trajectory can largely be attributed to the increasing demand for innovative electronic devices that simplify everyday life and enhance overall convenience. As technology continues to evolve, so too does the consumer electronics industry, which has become an integral part of modern life. Consumer electronics have revolutionized how people live, work, and connect. From smartphones and tablets to smartwatches and connected home devices, these products have become essential to daily routines. They make everyday tasks easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. Whether it’s remote working, entertainment, or staying connected with loved ones, consumer electronics play a pivotal role in these activities. The steady stream of technological innovation has been a driving force behind the industry’s continued growth, as consumers seek out new devices that integrate seamlessly into their lives.\n\nConsumer electronics devices, which are designed for communication, entertainment, and information purposes, play a crucial role in the tech landscape. Continuous innovation and the release of new, interconnected devices ensure the industry's competitiveness, with companies constantly striving to capture consumer interest. Despite global economic challenges, the consumer electronics  market remains resilient, driven by advancements in areas like AI and smart devices. Wearables, such as smartwatches, alongside newer technologies like AR glasses and VR headsets, are gaining popularity. For example, smartphone shipments reached around 1.2 billion units globally in 2023, cementing the category’s status as the most profitable segment. The market is projected to grow further in the coming years. According to industry reports, revenue could reach $1.13 trillion by 2025, recording a steady annual growth rate of 3%. Additionally, sustainability and recycling trends have become increasingly important, with companies benefiting from recycling materials to address challenges like the global chip shortage. The global electronics recycling market is expected to exceed $57 billion by 2025, further underscoring the industry's forward-thinking approach to innovation and sustainability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe business environment is rapidly evolving, and by 2035, what is considered business-as-usual today will likely be vastly different. Stricter regulations and heightened market expectations are expected to result in increased costs related to raw material extraction, logistics, CO2 emissions pricing, and end-of-life expenses. According to a PWC report, the electronics industry could face a 15% increase in operational costs by 2035, compared to a 2023 baseline. This is due to rising landfill fees, longer transportation distances, fluctuating raw material prices, and the depletion of critical resources like copper, cobalt, lithium, and gold. To mitigate these rising costs, businesses can adopt circular business models that lead to lower operational expenses through CO2 savings and efficiency gains. Proactively transitioning to circular models offers a significant cost advantage over passively complying with regulations and sticking to traditional linear models. PWC’s projections reveal that circular business models could lead to cost savings of around 12% and CO2 reductions of at least 10% by 2035 compared to a business-as-usual approach.\n\nNorth America, particularly the United States, is at the forefront of the consumer electronics market, leading globally in terms of adoption and demand. The region is expected to maintain this leadership position due to its swift embrace of cutting-edge technologies. In the U.S., the fast-paced lifestyle increasingly revolves around digital solutions, with automation becoming a key priority. The American market continues to thrive on its demand for new and innovative devices that can streamline everyday tasks and improve productivity. With the integration of advanced technologies and ongoing innovation, North America remains a critical region for the growth of the consumer electronics industry. At the same time, the rise of smart home technologies has opened up new opportunities for growth in the consumer electronics market. Devices like voice assistants and internet-connected home appliances are becoming increasingly popular, driving demand for products that make everyday life more convenient. The integration of consumer electronics with these technologies is shaping the future of home automation. Companies with advanced voice recognition technology are playing a significant role in the smart home revolution. Collaborative partnerships between firms and AI specialists are further enhancing the potential of these technologies, pointing to a future where smart homes become the norm.\n\nChina has also emerged as a major force in the global consumer electronics market, contributing significantly to the supply chain. As a leading producer of electronic components and raw materials, China plays a crucial role in meeting the global demand for consumer electronics. The Chinese market is witnessing a surge in the adoption of devices with voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, making lives more convenient. The country’s commitment to technological innovation and the growing preference for smart devices are fueling its market growth. With these advancements, China's consumer electronics market is projected to continue expanding at an impressive rate over the next decade. In Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom stand out as key markets with immense potential. These countries have seen high adoption rates of consumer electronics such as smartphones, televisions, personal computers, and cameras. European companies are heavily investing in research and development, and many are forming collaborations aimed at driving innovation in the industry. This focus on innovation and the growing demand for high-quality consumer electronics make Europe an exciting region for market growth.\n\nAs the global consumer electronics industry continues to expand, it presents compelling opportunities for investors. In this article, we’ll explore the 10 best consumer electronics stocks to buy, offering valuable insights into the companies leading the way in this dynamic and fast-evolving sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we screened for consumer electronics companies using the Finviz stock screener and sifted through online rankings. We compiled a preliminary list of 15 stocks and then scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds and to pick the 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors as of the end of the second quarter of 2024. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nLeading the list of our ten best consumer electronics stocks to buy is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has once again demonstrated its resilience and market leadership by exceeding earnings expectations in Q3 2024. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40, surpassing the anticipated $1.35. Apple's robust performance was underpinned by its June quarter revenue, which hit a record high of $85.8 billion, a 5% increase from the previous year. This growth reflects the company’s ability to maintain strong market momentum despite global economic challenges.\n\nA key driver of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) success is its diverse revenue streams, particularly in its services division. Services revenue set a new all-time record at $24.2 billion, marking a 14% year-over-year growth. This division, which includes Apple TV+, cloud services, and payment solutions, continues to gain traction, with over 1 billion paid subscriptions globally. The strong performance in services, with a gross margin of 74%, has significantly contributed to the company's overall profitability.\n\nIn terms of products, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone revenue reached $39.3 billion, showing resilience despite a slight year-over-year decline. The installed base of iPhones hit a new all-time high, and the company is poised to benefit further from the upcoming iPhone 15 lineup and iOS 18. Mac revenue also grew by 2% to $7 billion, driven by strong demand for the M3-powered MacBook Air, particularly in emerging markets. The iPad segment witnessed remarkable growth, with revenue surging 24% year-over-year, reflecting the successful launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to innovate remains a cornerstone of its success. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) through Apple Intelligence and the launch of the Vision Pro have sparked excitement among both consumers and enterprises. These developments not only showcase Apple's technological prowess but also position the company for continued growth in emerging markets and new industries, such as spatial computing. With strong fundamentals, a diversified product and service portfolio, and a commitment to innovation, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a top pick in the consumer electronics sector for long-term investors. The company's strong financial position, with $153 billion in cash and a disciplined capital return program, further solidifies its bullish outlook.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough.

Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best consumer electronics stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Prediction: This Stock Will Become Warren Buffett's Next Coca-Cola",
        "content": "Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is not the biggest position in Warren Buffett's portfolio, but it is one of the billionaire's favorites -- and one that likely will remain there at current levels.\n\nBuffett started buying shares of the world's biggest nonalcoholic beverage maker in 1987 and continued adding to the position for a period of seven years. Those 400 million shares haven't budged since. In fact, he has even described his holding on to Coca-Cola as \"a Rip Van Winkle slumber.\"\n\nBuffett, known to drink several cans of Coke a day, clearly loves the product, and he also loves the fact that others feel the same way, too. This brand strength offers the company a moat, or competitive advantage, a key element Buffett looks for in a company. On top of this, the beverage giant has grown earnings over time and rewards investors with dividends.\n\nFor these reasons, Coca-Cola is likely here to stay in its position in the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. But it might not be the only stock to win Buffett's permanent loyalty. In fact, a stock that he just reduced his position in could actually join Coke as one of Berkshire Hathaway's \"forever\" holdings. My prediction is this stock will become Buffett's next Coca-Cola ... Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett recently sold some shares of this stock\n\nSo, which stock am I talking about? Well, it's another company that's a household name, though it operates in the technology industry rather than the beverage sector: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nBut wait a minute, you might be saying, Buffett soldsome of his shares in the iPhone maker during the second quarter. Isn't that a bad sign?\n\nNot necessarily. At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett signaled that his Apple sales are linked to locking in the current 21% capital gains tax rate, and not due to a loss of faith in the company. He expects the tax rate to go up, considering the current size of the federal deficit. Even counting the sale of 49% of his Apple position, Buffett said it is \"extremely likely\" that at the end of the year, it will be Berkshire's largest common-stock holding.\n\nThe recent sale in Apple brings the holding down to 400 million shares. Sound familiar? That's the same number of shares Berkshire holds in Coca-Cola. This, of course, is an interesting detail to point out, but I'm not basing my prediction on it. I have a stronger argument for why Buffett could view Apple as his next Coca-Cola.\n\nA \"brilliant CEO\"\n\nAnd this has to do with his confidence in the way the company is run and its solid earnings record. In Buffett's 2021 shareholder letter, he referred to Tim Cook as Apple's \"brilliant CEO\" and praised his decision to repurchase Apple shares. Share buybacks increase the ownership of current holders without them paying a dime.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese repurchases helped Berkshire increase its holding from 5.2% of Apple in 2018, when it completed its purchases of the stock, to 5.4% by 2020. Berkshire started buying Apple shares back in 2016.\n\nCook's expertise also has guided Apple along the path of double-digit earnings growth over the past five years. And, like Coca-Cola, Apple has a significant moat, with users of the iPhone flocking to the company each time a new version is released. Last year, for the first time ever, Apple won the top seven spots on the list of the top-selling smartphones that's compiled by Counterpoint, a technology market research firm.\n\nAn \"enduring moat\"\n\n\"A truly great business must have an enduring 'moat' that protects excellent returns on invested capital,\" Buffett wrote in his 2007 letter to shareholders, emphasizing the importance of this when choosing investments.\n\nLastly, one more thing about Apple could help it become the \"second Coca-Cola\" in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio: the company's commitment to dividends. Berkshire Hathaway has averaged about $775 million annually in Apple dividends since 2018.\n\nTechnology companies aren't known to pay out tremendous dividends since they invest a lot back into growth, so Apple's dividend isn't the biggest on the block. But the company has steadily paid one since 2012. And at $1 per share annually, for a dividend yield of 0.4%, it's an attractive part of the complete package.\n\nAll of this prompts me to predict that, like Coca-Cola, Apple will be a permanent fixture in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. And thanks to its strong earnings track record, strong moat, and dividend policy, this tech stock makes a great addition to any portfolio needing the fantastic combination of growth and safety.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Stock Pick You Need to Know in Jim Cramer’s Latest Watchlist?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Watchlist: 10 Stock Picks You Need to Know. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands among other stock picks in Jim Cramer's latest watchlist. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto their stocks, anticipating a rebound after the market’s downturn. This advice proved useful as the Dow rose by 484 points or 1.16% and the NASDAQ also climbed by 1.16%, indicating that selling during the market decline was not the best choice.\n\n“Last week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday’s downturn wasn’t the best strategy.”\n\nJim Cramer noted that the previous week was tough for economically sensitive and tech stocks, despite a mixed August employment report. This report suggested a balanced economic outlook, not too strong or weak, which initially seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, shifting away from cyclical stocks to more recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, with industries such as industrials and semiconductors being particularly affected. Cramer observed that recession-proof stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, have performed well recently but have seen significant gains, raising concerns about a potential correction.\n\n“Today, recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.”\n\nHe highlighted that historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it signals a shift in investment strategy. With the Fed expected to ease rates soon, Cramer suggests investors consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and look into more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulus. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn is challenging, the anticipated rate cuts could make these stocks more attractive. Cramer advises maintaining diversification but being ready to adjust investment strategies based on the economic outlook.\n\n“Historically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it’s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it’s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it’s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It’s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nOur Methodology This article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he talked about several stocks. From there, we picked ten companies and discussed how hedge funds are investing in them. Finally, we rank these companies from those least owned to those most owned by hedge funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184 Jim Cramer notes that Wall Street has largely ignored Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s new iPhone features, but he expects consumers to embrace them. He advises focusing on buying high-quality stocks during market dips rather than reacting to short-term volatility. Cramer suggests that if Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock drops tomorrow, it could be a good buying opportunity. Overall, he recommends staying calm and strategic instead of reacting to daily market swings.\n\n“Today Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced a new phone, and nobody seemed to care. I think this is one of those product launches that gets lost on Wall Street but is eventually loved on Main Street. Wall Street doesn’t care about better battery life, autocorrect spell-checks, or the ability to take a picture of a restaurant and immediately see reviews. It doesn’t care about AI functionality. The Street just wants to know the rollout schedule so they can model earnings. But Main Street wants everything Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s offering, and you know the wireless carriers will push the new iPhone 16 like they do with every iPhone iteration. Which brings me back to sitting on your hands. Most of the big moves are a product of algorithms that spit out strategies, creating tons of volatility. Rather than trying to figure out what’s driving these irrational moves, you should focus on buying dips in high-quality stocks when there’s no data—like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) , which I would have told you to own, not trade. At the same time, I’d use the strength to sell some of the defensive stocks that have gone parabolic—they seem risky to me. And of course, you need to decide whether to buy Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock tomorrow morning, right when the negative Wall Street analysts clash with the rabid desire of Apple users to buy the new iteration. That’s what’s substantive. I’m hoping for you that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) opens down. Bottom line: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s 9-cent decline in value is the only true move in a session dictated by larger macro forces that are most likely wrong by themselves but possibly right when taken together. The recent action? So rather than freaking out during Friday’s sell-off or just celebrating today, you could have just sat on your hands and spared yourself the agony and friction that comes with endless buying and selling.”\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a strong investment choice due to its solid market position, growing services sector, and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Despite facing recent challenges like increased competition in China and a softer iPhone 15 cycle, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s future prospects look promising. The upcoming iPhone 16, which is expected to include advanced AI features, is likely to drive strong demand. Additionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Services division continues to grow, becoming a key part of its financial success. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) benefits from its large base of over 2 billion iOS devices, providing a steady revenue stream. New AI innovations are set to further boost growth. CEO Tim Cook’s strategy to address competition and focus on AI is crucial for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s expansion. Analyst Daniel Ives predicts a recovery in iPhone sales for fiscal year 2025 and highlights the potential of new AI features. Even though Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently saw a dip in stock price and a reduced stake by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)’s continued investment indicates confidence in Apple’s long-term outlook. Overall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s loyal customer base and innovative AI efforts position it well for future growth. Baron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period. This quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile… (Click here to read more)\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nOracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 93 Jim Cramer highlighted a recent positive report from Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL), noting that much of the good news is tied to the expansion of AI data centers. Cramer believes that the sell-off in chip stocks has been overdone, as the reasons for favoring this sector earlier in the year still hold true. He emphasized that the surge in AI spending is genuine, with significant investments in building the necessary infrastructure, as demonstrated by Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)’s latest results.\n\n“This very evening, we got a startlingly good report from Oracle. A lot of the good news came in concert with data centers for AI. Hey, not bad! In the end, I think the chip stocks have sold off way too hard. Every reason we had to like this group earlier this year remains intact. The AI spending boom is very real, and there’s a ton of money being spent to build out the infrastructure, as we heard from Oracle this evening.\n\nMore importantly, there’s more to chips than AI. For the past couple of quarters, we’ve been exiting a period of oversupply in the semiconductor market, and we’re now finally seeing some excellent sales growth. Yes, we’re past the point of equilibrium—we’re going up!”\n\nIn Q1 2024, Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)’s earnings rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, surpassing expectations. Its adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share also beat forecasts of $1.32. Revenue grew by 6.9% to $13.31 billion, driven mainly by its cloud services. The cloud segment, boosted by the acquisition of Cerner Corporation (NASDAQ:CERN), saw a 20% increase year-over-year, reaching $5.3 billion. Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) experienced a remarkable 42% growth, highlighting its successful focus on high-demand cloud and AI services. Additionally, Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) has secured over $12 billion in AI contracts, positioning itself strongly in the AI field. Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)’s future revenue prospects are supported by a substantial $98 billion in remaining performance obligations. With its leadership in cloud technology and expanding AI contracts, Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is set for continued growth, making it an attractive investment. Carillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock rose to all-time highs after the company announced better than expected cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle signed dozens of new customers, including two leaders in generative artificial intelligence. The backlog remains, and strong growth appears poised to accelerate.”\n\nOverall ORCL ranks 2nd on our list. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\n\n“Investors Need a Reason to Buy”\n\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\n\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed’s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street’s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\n\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\n\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\n\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\n\n“Volatility Over the Last Several Weeks is Unwarranted”\n\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed’s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\n\nKrei pressed that despite the “unwarranted” volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\n\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results. Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Blue Chip Stock To Invest In According to Short Sellers?\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Blue Chip Stock To Invest In According to Short Sellers?\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.80%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the best blue chip stocks to invest in. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple’s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. With pre-orders for the iPhone 16 opening on September 16, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report strong financial results for the rest of 2024.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 12% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer On Apple Inc. (AAPL): “Does anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore?”",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer thinks deserve attention.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold off on selling stocks, anticipating a rebound once the market’s downturn ended. This strategy proved effective as the average investor saw gains, with the Dow rising by 484 points or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing by 1.16%. This performance suggests that selling during Friday’s decline was not the best move.\n\n“Last week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday’s downturn wasn’t the best strategy.”\n\nThe previous week was challenging for economically sensitive stocks and tech stocks, despite the August employment report showing modest growth and a downward revision for July. The recent report seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as it presented a balanced scenario of neither too strong nor too weak. Nonetheless, Wall Street reacted negatively, with investors moving away from cyclical stocks in favor of recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals. Industrials and semiconductors were particularly affected.\n\nJim Cramer observed that on Monday, recession-proof stocks such as pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform strongly. However, this trend is concerning as these stocks have surged significantly and might be due for a correction.\n\n“Recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.”\n\nAccording to Cramer, historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it’s a signal to shift investment strategies. With the Fed moving towards easing and a rate cut expected next week, Cramer suggests it’s time to reconsider holding recession-proof stocks. Instead, investors should look at more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulation. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn can be challenging, anticipating a positive impact from the Fed’s rate cuts could make these stocks attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Historically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it’s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it’s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it’s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It’s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Jim Cramer Think Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Deserves Your Attention?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer noted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone launch event starts at 1 p.m. ET on Monday. He questioned whether artificial intelligence still captures investor interest, especially in light of recent trading trends among AI-related stocks.\n\n“Apple ’s iPhone launch event begins at 1 p.m. ET Monday. Does anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade.”\n\nA positive outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is backed by its strong financial performance and promising future. In the third quarter, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported impressive revenue of $85.8 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year despite foreign exchange issues. The Services segment saw record revenue of $24.2 billion, driven by more subscriptions and new services. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s profitability remains strong with a 46.3% gross margin and net income of $21.4 billion.\n\nAlthough iPhone revenue slightly declined, other products like iPads and Macs performed well, with Mac sales boosted by new M3 devices and iPad sales rising 20% year-over-year. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s focus on emerging technologies, such as AI and augmented reality, especially with the upcoming Vision Pro AR headset, positions it well for future growth. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also returned $32 billion to shareholders in Q3 2024 through dividends and share buybacks, reflecting confidence in its long-term financial health.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile.\n\nApple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago.

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $222.50, denoting a -0.12% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.54% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.72%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.65%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 0.87% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.3% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.86%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.60 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.59%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $94.52 billion, indicating a 5.61% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.70 per share and a revenue of $390.63 billion, signifying shifts of +9.3% and +1.92%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.37% higher. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 33.23. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.05.\n\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.62.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "There's no denying Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't quite the must-have stock it was when the iPhone was still relatively new. Although it's certainly still one of the market's most respectable prospects, the old spark simply isn't there. It happens.\n\nHowever, don't let a lack of excitement deter you from stepping into a new position in this name. While the thrill is gone, the upside potential isn't. This company's still got a great deal going for it, even if most investors don't seem to see it or care. Here are the top three reasons to buy Apple stock -- today.\n\nThe AI-enabled iPhone is the real deal\n\nBy the time it was officially unveiled this on Sept. 9, little about Apple's latest iPhone -- the iPhone 16 -- surprised anyone. The basic and the so-called \"plus\" versions of the world's most popular smartphone offer an improved camera and a more functional action button.\n\nOf course, these updated devices are powered by an A18 processor chip capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) duties directly from the phone itself. (In almost all cases right now, this work is handled in the cloud, slowing down the workflow.)\n\nThe market's response to the unveiling was ho-hum. Investors already knew not only that the iPhone 16, scheduled to go on sale later this month, would be capable of handling AI work but also that the Apple Intelligence software that will turn a properly equipped iPhone or iPad into a true AI device won't be made available until next month. And even then, it won't be a worldwide launch of everything Apple intends for its AI platform to be.\n\nEvery day's delay is an opportunity for competing tools like Alphabet's Google Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot to become the AI tool of choice for consumers.\n\nWhat's largely being underestimated is the continued strength of the Apple brand and users' loyalty to it. Bloomberg Intelligence reports that 93% of current owners of Apple devices would buy another Apple device versus only 80% of current users of Android devices. The option to own a true self-contained AI device might just be the upgrade this crowd's been waiting for. And there's little doubt Apple Intelligence will be Apple's typical easy-to-use tech.\n\nThe right tailwind is certainly in place, too. Technology market research outfit IDC believes the world will see sales of 234.2 million generative-AI-capable smartphones this year, en route to 912 million such devices in 2028. Apple's sure to win at least its fair share of this long-term growth. The slow rollout of Apple Intelligence isn't likely to be a lingering problem.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's increasingly about high-margin services\n\nWhen the iPhone was still relatively new, it in and of itself was a profit center. And in most regards, it's still a huge source of revenue, making up about half of Apple's sales.\n\nAs time has marched on, though, the iPhone has become a means to another end. Namely, it's driving demand for digital services, like apps, streaming video, music, and more, now that people have easy access to such offerings at their fingertips. Services are now Apple's second-biggest revenue driver behind the iPhone, in fact, accounting for nearly one-fourth of the company's top line.\n\nThis obviously still leaves the iPhone as Apple's primary breadwinner. There's a detail worth noting here, however. While devices like the iPhone ultimately account for three-fourths of the company's total business, in that it's a much higher-margin business, services generate nearly 40% of Apple's gross income. Apple's services gross profits now account for nearly 40% of gross income.\n\nData source: Apple. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\n\nThat proportion is only apt to continue swelling, too, as more consumers purchase the new iPhone for its AI capabilities and then end up using other features and offerings of the iOS ecosystem.\n\nApple stock is down when it shouldn't be\n\nFinally, you may want to take on a new position in Apple stock sooner than later for the simplest of reasons -- it's down from July's peak despite the recent publicity event that introduced a range of improved and updated consumer technologies, such as the aforementioned iPhone 16.\n\nIt's not quite the norm. More often than not Apple's September events light a fresh fire under the stock. This year, shares started soaring in June in response to early glimpses at the company's long-term AI ambitions. By July, most of what was confirmed this past week was already priced into the stock, and then some. That's why the stock's been sliding since then, continuing to do so after this month's high-profile unveiling.\n\nThat's not likely to be the case much longer, though.\n\nSee, despite Apple's late-to-the-party, slow-moving entry into the AI race and the stock's recent pullback, Wall Street remains bullish. The majority of the analyst community still considers the stock a strong buy, with a consensus target price of $247.22. That's about 11% above the stock's present price, which isn't much, but it's certainly a start.\n\nAs Apple's AI efforts start to prove themselves marketable growth drivers, don't be surprised to see Wall Street begin raising its average price target. Of course, this will blaze a trail for the ticker to move higher as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Loading Up on Stocks Again; Here Are the 6 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "While election season is keeping politicians occupied along with their regular legislative duties, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, hasn't lost focus on adding to her stock portfolio. The representative from the Peach State steadfastly picked up new positions throughout the past few months, demonstrating interest in everything from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to Vanguard funds.\n\nIn the latest go-round, Greene, increased her AI exposure in a variety of ways, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). While Greene didn't disclose the exact amount that she invested in each of the stocks, her regulatory filing reveals that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nMore of the same magnificent (and other) names\n\nReviewing her stock purchases over the past few months, investors will find that Greene clearly has a penchant for artificial intelligence stocks -- in particular, \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. In fact, in her latest round of buying activity, Greene was building larger positions in stocks she had already purchased. Greene scooped up shares of Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia on Sept. 3, having bought the same stocks on Aug. 21. Greene didn't disclose her motivation for the move, but it's possible that she sensed a buying opportunity. Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia fell 5%, 2%, and 16%, respectively, between Aug. 21 and Sept. 3.\n\nWhile there's no clear explanation for the sell-off in Alphabet stock at that time, it may simply be an extension of the market's skepticism regarding Alphabet's future after it lost an important antitrust case over the summer. With regard to Amazon, investors may have been bearish in reaction to Reuters reporting on Aug. 29 that some Amazon workers would join a Teamsters strike against unfair labor practices that had extended into several states. And investors were likely clicking the sell button on Nvidia stock after the company failed to meet the market's sky-high expectations for its second-quarter 2025 financial results.\n\nApple represents another Magnificent Seven stock that found its way to Greene's buy list again. Previously, Greene had bought the tech superstar's stock in May, and it's possible that she chose to increase her position in September after a slight sell-off following news that Warren Buffett pared the BerkshireHathaway position in Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough it's not a Magnificent Seven stock, CrowdStrike is another repeat-buy stock that Greene had bought previously -- this one in in June. Perhaps sensing another bargain, Greene may have seen value in the cybersecurity specialist, whose stock took a nosedive, after it was found to be largely responsible for causing global internet outages in July.\n\nDriving in a new direction\n\nHitching a ride with an electric vehicle (EV) stalwart for the first time, Greene added shares of Tesla to her portfolio -- a stock that provides even more exposure the burgeoning field of AI. In addition to providing Tesla drivers with the option for autonomous driving capability with its AI-powered full self-driving mode, Tesla has committed to developing humanoid robots that are embedded with AI.\n\nDespite its stock falling in late July and into August, Tesla electrified the hopes of some investors in August when they learned that the company's Cybertruck sales were strong in July -- an auspicious sign for a stock that many had maligned after the company reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nWhat's a Main Street investor to do?\n\nSmart as it may be to dig into politicians' stock buys and sales, it's never a wise move to blindly follow their actions. Instead, investors should resolve to use the knowledge of politicians' stock moves as starting points for engaging in further research. Nonetheless, Greene's recent stock picks are all worthwhile considerations at the moment, as all six stocks are industry leaders that provide investors with varying types of exposure to AI.\n\nFor those looking to strengthen their holdings with a leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike is a worthy consideration even after the July incident. Similarly, with bearish sentiment surrounding Alphabet from its lost antitrust case, now may be a good time to pick up shares for those with long-term investing horizons who don't find near-term volatility daunting. And with regard to Amazon, the company continues to report strong financials thanks to its Amazon Web Services business along with its other offerings, even inspiring billionaires to click the buy button.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and Tesla, on the other hand, are three AI powerhouses that continue to dominate their respective fields and are well worth strong consideration from investors with varying types of investing goals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $716,375!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Been a Net-Seller of Stocks to the Tune of $132 Billion Since October 2022 -- But He Can't Stop Buying These 2 Stocks",
        "content": "For much of the last 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been lapping Wall Street's major stock indexes with ease.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha,\" as he's been affably dubbed by the investing community, has overseen an average annual return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that nearly doubles up the annualized total return of the benchmark S&P 500, including dividends, since the mid-1960s. More recently, he witnessed Berkshire reaching a trillion-dollar valuation, which is a mark only eight U.S.-listed companies have ever achieved. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nEven though Warren Buffett is fallible -- Berkshire took a sizable loss on its now-disposed stake in media stock Paramount Global earlier this year -- his notable outperformance of the broad-market indexes has earned him quite the following from new and tenured investors alike.\n\nBut despite being a big proponent of the U.S. economy and long-term investing, Buffett's buying activity over the last seven quarters has been exceptionally selective.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has been a big-time net-seller of stocks for seven consecutive quarters\n\nInvestors typically wait on the edge of their seats for Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filing, which provides a detailed picture of which stocks Buffett and his most trusted investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been buying and selling.\n\nHowever, Berkshire's cash flow statements, which can be found in its quarterly operating results, paint the clearest picture of how he and his team feel about stocks.\n\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 (Oct. 1, 2022) and continuing through June 30, 2024 -- a span of seven quarters -- Berkshire's brightest investment minds have been net sellers of stocks:\n\nQ4 2022: $14.64 billion in net-equity sales Q1 2023: $10.41 billion Q2 2023: $7.981 billion Q3 2023: $5.253 billion Q4 2023: $0.525 billion Q1 2024: $17.281 billion Q2 2024: $75.536 billion\n\nCumulatively, Buffett has overseen the sale of almost $132 billion more in stocks than he and his team have purchased since October 2022.\n\nThe bulk of this selling activity can be traced to the No. 1 holding in Berkshire's 45-stock, $308 billion investment portfolio, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Buffett has been a seller of Apple stock in each of the past three quarters, with well over 500 million shares being shown the door.\n\nAlthough the Oracle of Omaha continues to proclaim Apple is a wonderful company with a solid management team and market-leading share repurchase program, during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, he opined that corporate tax rates were liable to climb from where they stand now. In other words, Buffett sees value in taking profits now and paying a lower tax rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe've also witnessed sizable selling activity in Berkshire's former No. 2 holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Since mid-July, Buffett has disposed of more than 168 million shares of BofA, worth just shy of $7 billion. While this selling may also be tax-related, there's a possibility it may be in response to the Federal Reserve kicking off a rate-easing cycle. No money-center bank is more interest-sensitive than Bank of America.\n\nBut in spite of this persistent selling in two core holdings, there are two stocks Warren Buffett simply can't stop buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nThe first stock the Oracle of Omaha has been buying with consistency since the beginning of 2022 is oil and gas goliath Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). This \"indefinite holding\" has grown into an almost 255.3-million-share stake worth $13.3 billion in market value, as of the closing bell on Sept. 9.\n\nThe most logical reason for Buffett to pile into Occidental's stock is the belief that the spot price for crude oil will remain elevated, or perhaps head even higher than it is now. Following three years of reduced capital spending by global energy companies during the COVID-19 pandemic's height, crude oil supply remains largely constrained. When in-demand energy commodities are in short supply, it usually has a positive effect on price.\n\nThough a higher spot price for crude oil is good news for all drilling companies, it's particularly important for Occidental Petroleum. Occidental generates the lion's share of its revenue from its high-margin drilling segment, which suggests that a higher spot price for oil can disproportionately benefit its operating cash flow, compared to its peers.\n\nBuffett likely also appreciates the integrated nature of Occidental's operating model. While it does bring in most of its revenue from drilling, its downstream chemical operations serve as a partial hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. When the price of oil falls, it lowers input costs for petrochemical operations, and generally increases demand for downstream-related products.\n\nOccidental has meaningfully improved its balance sheet, too. Since acquiring Anadarko for $55 billion in 2019, it's nearly halved its net debt to $18.39 billion, as of June 30. While there's still work to be done to improve Occidental's financial flexibility, a higher spot price for crude oil has certainly loosened the belt a bit.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\nThe other stock Warren Buffett can't stop buying, despite being exceptionally selective with his purchasing activity of late, is (drum roll) shares of his own company!\n\nPrior to mid-July 2018, the Oracle of Omaha and his right-hand man Charlie Munger (Munger passed away in November 2023 at the age of 99) were only allowed to repurchase Berkshire Hathaway's stock if it fell to or below 120% of book value -- no more than a 20% premium to book value, as of the most recent quarter. Unfortunately, shares never fell to or below this threshold, leading to no buybacks.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board amended the criteria governing share repurchases to allow Buffett and Munger more freedom to buy back their company's stock. As long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett believes shares are intrinsically cheap, repurchases can be made with no ceiling or end date.\n\nOver the last six years, Buffett has overseen 24 consecutive quarters of buyback activity totaling almost $78 billion.\n\nSince Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, buybacks are the direct way Buffett rewards his shareholders. Reducing Berkshire's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of the company's investors, as well as encouraging the long-term ethos that Charlie Munger instilled in his four-plus decades at the company.\n\nThe other benefit of share repurchases is that, for businesses like Berkshire that have steady or growing net income (sans unrealized investment gains/losses), they often increase earnings per share (EPS). With almost $277 billion in available cash, Warren Buffett is strongly incented to continue buying shares of his own company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Affirm (AFRM) has matured as a public company and is taking aim at being the modern competitor to American Express (AXP), says its CEO.\n\n\"From the very beginning we said we're trying to build a modern answer to American Express. I admire American Express greatly... But it is a club and a club with a velvet rope, and you have to be good enough to be on the right side of the rope,” Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference this week.\n\n“I wanted to build a payment system for anyone who wants to be a part of something that stands for no late fees, no deferred interest, real transparency, real pro-consumer attitude, helping people get the things they want without having to get into debt that they can't repay. And that that's what we are today,\"\n\nIt has been a wild ride to reach this point for the PayPal (PYPL) co-founder.\n\nAffirm went public in early January 2021. The stock, initially priced at $49, skyrocketed to $100 by the close of its first day of trading, in part due to optimism around buy now, pay later companies and Levchin's strong reputation building tech businesses.\n\nBy late November, Affirm's stock hit $168 a share after the company landed deals with Amazon and Shopify.\n\nHowever, come January 3, 2023, Affirm shares closed at a record low of $9.03 as investors put pressure on unprofitable tech companies and the stock market adjusted to higher interest rates. A month later, Affirm laid off 19% of its workforce.\n\nDespite the post IPO stock volatility, Levchin has repeatedly told me he hasn't sold a single share. Today, he no longer views Affirm as a buy now pay later company waging a singular war against rival Klarna.\n\nRather, it’s a broader payment platform that is looking to wrestle market share from the aforementioned Amex and PayPal.\n\nThe company has since introduced the Affirm Card, which offers no annual fees, hidden fees, or compound interest. It has also secured a deal to be integrated as a buy now, pay later option on Apple (AAPL) Pay.\n\nShares have rallied back to above $40, and are up 80% in the past year according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nAlong with the cost-cutting moves, Affirm's financials have improved as well.\n\nFor the fiscal year-ended June 30, total revenue rose 46% year over year to $2.3 billion. The company posted $381 million in adjusted operating income.\n\nLevchin says Affirm will be profitable on GAAP basis for the first time in the fourth quarter of its current fiscal year, and to stay profitable thereafter.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Affirm continues to fire on all cylinders, outgrowing e-comm/payment peers and flexing operational leverage,\" JPMorgan analyst Reginald Smith said in a client note.\n\nSmith rates Affirm's stock at an Overweight, or a Buy equivalent.\n\nTo be fair, Affirm does have a way to go to catch the 174-year old Amex.\n\nAffirm's market cap of $12.5 billion is well shy of Amex's at $180 billion.\n\nThe Street estimates Amex will haul in about $60 billion in sales in its current fiscal year. Affirm is pegged for around $3 billion in annual sales.\n\nSays Levchin, \"Now, the next few steps are just to get bigger, just get more services, more consumers, and more merchants.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "FDA Approves First OTC Hearing Aid Software Compatible With Apple's AirPods Pro\n\nThe FDA has approved the first over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid software device for use with compatible versions of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AirPods Pro headphones.\n\nKnown as the Hearing Aid Feature (HAF), the software is designed to enhance accessibility for individuals 18 and older with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment. This approval marks a significant milestone in the expansion of consumer hearing solutions.\n\nThe HAF allows users to transform their AirPods Pro into an OTC hearing aid by installing and customizing the software to their hearing needs.\n\nAccording to the FDA, this device is expected to improve access to affordable hearing solutions, especially for those who might otherwise avoid seeking professional care.\n\nMichelle Tarver, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, emphasized that this move enhances the availability, accessibility, and acceptability of hearing support for adults.\n\nThe Hearing Aid Feature leverages a self-fitting strategy, enabling users to adjust volume, tone, and balance settings using an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad.\n\nThe software also integrates with iOS HealthKit, tailoring the hearing experience to the user’s needs. In a clinical study involving 118 participants, the HAF demonstrated results comparable to those of professionally fitted hearing aids, showing similar levels of sound amplification and speech understanding in noisy environments.\n\nThis software is the first of its kind to be cleared under the FDA’s De Novo premarket review pathway, which allows for the introduction of novel low-to-moderate-risk devices.\n\nThe approval is part of a broader regulatory change that started with the FDA’s October 2022 OTC hearing aid rules, which allowed consumers to purchase hearing aids without a medical exam or audiologist consultation. These regulations aim to improve access to safe and effective hearing aids for millions of Americans with mild to moderate hearing loss.\n\nResearch has linked the use of hearing aids to reduced cognitive decline, depression, and other health issues, making affordable hearing solutions a crucial public health concern.\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is up 0.32% at $223.38 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHurricane Disrupts UPS Deliveries In Southern US: Details.\n\nPhoto via Apple\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "British-born population to be in decline from 2035",
        "content": "Declining populatio poses a critical threat to the economy and the public finances - Dominic Lipinski\n\nDeaths will consistently outnumber births in Britain from the middle of the next decade, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), in a tipping point that will leave the country dependent on migration.\n\nThe population of people born in Britain is forecast to begin declining in 2035, according to OBR projections published on Thursday. It follows a long-term fall in birth rates.\n\nThe UK’s birth rate has fallen from three per woman on average in the 1960s to around two a decade ago and 1.5 in 2022, following a similar pattern to much of the rich world.\n\nThe country needs a birth rate of 2.1 births per woman if the population is to remain stable without migration, the OBR said.\n\nDeaths outnumbered births for the first time since 1976 in 2020, a year disrupted by the pandemic, and figures published by the Office for National Statics (ONS) show there were just 400 more births than deaths last year.\n\nThe OBR expects a tipping point in the middle of the next decade at which point deaths consistently outnumber births. If net migration fell to zero, the population would start shrinking from 2035 as a result, dropping by 11m by the 2070s.\n\nIt poses a critical threat to the economy and the public finances as the drop in births leaves an increasingly elderly population more and more reliant on a smaller share of workers to pay their pensions and cover the cost of healthcare.\n\nWhile the UK-born population is forecast to be in decline by the middle of the next decade, the OBR does not expect the overall population to fall as strong net migration flows are expected to continue.\n\nThe spending watchdog, which made the projections as part of its modelling of public finances, forecast the population will grow from 68m last year to 82m in the 2070s, on the assumption that net migration averages 315,000 people per year.\n\nA net 685,000 people moved to Britain in 2023, down from 764,000 in the previous year but still up considerably higher than the 184,000 who came in 2019.\n\nThe previous Conservative Government repeatedly failed to meet its promises to bring down migration levels. Sir Keir Starmer pledged to reduce net migration in the Labour manifesto ahead of July’s election.\n\nEven assuming migration into Britain continues, the declining birth rate means over-65s will account for a growing share of the population while the proportion of children in the UK will shrink.\n\nIn 1974, one in four people in Britain were aged under 16. Today one-in-five are children. By 2074, that will fall to 15pc, meaning fewer than one-in-six will be under 16.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, the share of the population aged over-65 will increase from 18pc now to 27pc in the 2070s - meaning more than one-in-four people will be on or over the cusp of retirement.\n\nDavid Miles, a top official at the OBR, said the solution to the public finance challenge posed by the ageing population may be to work longer, rather than encouraging women to have more children.\n\nHe said: “People worry that with relatively low fertility rates, there’ll be a shortage of workers: who’s going to do all the work? Who’s going to look after the young and the old? I think part of the answer for that is the old themselves.\n\n“If there is a shortage of labour, there will be natural adjustments in terms of wages and also making work more attractive and feasible for people who, at the moment, we might think of as retirement age,” he said, suggesting more flexible work would help keep older people in the workforce for longer.\n\n“I think those adjustments over the long run I think will be very powerful [and] are probably more likely to be the answer to low fertility than trying to encourage women to have lots more children.”\n\nBirth rates are falling across much of the world, leading to fundamental changes in societies. This is epitomised by China, the world’s second-largest economy. The United Nations expects the Chinese population to drop by more than half over the course of this century, falling from 1.4bn today to under 650m by 2100.\n\nDecades of the one-child policy, which forbade couples from having more than one child, forcibly accelerated the country’s ageing. Despite officially cancelling the policy in 2015, the country’s population fell in both 2022 and 2023.\n\n06:13 PM BST\n\nSigning off\n\nThat’s all from us.

While there is widespread consensus on the Governing Council that policy restrictiveness should be eased, divergent views remain around the pace of cuts.\n\nWe expect a further one in December this year, taking the deposit rate down to 3.25pc. If the outlook weakens further, it will strengthen the case of more dovish policymakers to increase the pace of cuts in 2025, towards a terminal rate of around 2.25pc.\n\nPresident Lagarde once again gave little away in today’s statement, choosing instead to maintain flexibility ahead of the October and December meetings.

Yields move inversely to prices.\n\nThe two-year German yield was up six basis points at 2.2pc, after falling to its lowest since March 2023 on Wednesday at 2.13pc. Shorter-dated yields are highly sensitive to expectations about central bank interest rates.\n\nMarkets fully expect the ECB to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.5pc. Traders are pricing in the possibility of two more rate cuts this year, although that could change depending on what ECB President Christine Lagarde says during her press conference later.\n\nMohit Kumar, chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, said:\n\nA 25-bp cut is a consensus and should not be a surprise.\n\nWe expect Lagarde to adopt a neutral tone, justifying the rate cut given recent weakness in the data.\n\nOur view remains that the next cut after today is likely to be in December. The staff forecasts are likely to show that core inflation will still remain sticky, justifying a gradual approach from the ECB.\n\n12:52 PM BST\n\nWall Street poised to inch higher ahead of rate cuts\n\nUS stock indexes edged higher in premarket trading ahead of a likely interest rate cut next week.\n\nMost megacap and growth stocks rose slightly, with Google-parent Alphabet up more than 1pc.\n\nA string of weakening employment and economic growth data over the past few weeks had led to rising bets on a larger-than-usual 50-basis point interest rate reduction from the U.S. central bank, but those expectations have largely faded.\n\nAfter Wednesday’s inflation report, traders now see an 87pc chance of the Fed cutting interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets on September 17-18, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that’d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the “iPhone moment” for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the “App Store moment.”\n\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\n\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\n“Annual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.”\n\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Analysts Recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Stock?\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nBen Reitzes, Melius Research’s head of technology research, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a “generational” upgrade cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\n“First, the installed base of phones is old. So, we have that going for us. Then, Apple Intelligence only works on the newer phones.”\n\nThe analyst said that he’s very “upbeat” on Apple shares. Asked about Buffett selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, he said he might have “other motivations.”\n\nBen Reitzes said that he believes Apple’s upgrade cycle would peak in 2026 and Wall Street expectations for Apple are easily beatable.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\n“We believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’ suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,  iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.”\n\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they’d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nThird Point Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nIn April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.\n\nDespite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "'No huge surprises': Why Apple stock hasn't moved much on iPhone 16 news",
        "content": "Apple's artificial intelligence offering, Apple Intelligence, was the star of its annual iPhone event on Monday.\n\nBut for investors, the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence could pose a problem. While Apple's iPhone 16 hits stores on Sept. 20, the software update required for Apple Intelligence won't be available for US English users until October.\n\nThe disconnect between the hardware and software may have been one reason why Apple stock didn't move much on the news. Shares of the iPhone maker were down by about 0.9% during the company's \"Glowtime\" presentation in Cupertino, Calif., and they were up less than 1% over the three days since the event.\n\n“No huge surprises,” Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng told Yahoo Finance about the Apple iPhone unveiling. “I think it was straight down the fairway,” he said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on Tuesday.\n\nNg, who has a Buy rating on Apple, said he's \"constructive\" on the stock and that its performance is par for the course on iPhone rollout days.\n\nHis team estimated that Apple stock has historically underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) by 70 basis points on launch days. On Monday, that underperformance hit 100 basis points, which Ng said was \"mostly in line with historic events.\"\n\nApple stock tends to perform better a month or even two months out from launch days. Last year, shares of Apple were off by 1% a day after the iPhone 15 was announced. 60 days later, the stock was up 6%, according to Bank of America data. In 2019, shares were up 3% the day after Apple revealed the iPhone 11 and gained 20% over the next two months.\n\n\"We think that there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones,\" Ng said.\n\nAn upgrade cycle sooner or later?\n\nThe big question for Apple and its shareholders is whether AI will be enough to drive consumers to upgrade their smartphones.\n\n\"There’s a tremendous amount of debate about whether or not AI is going to be that demand driver,\" Ng said. \"I certainly believe that it is.\"\n\nNg noted that investors have estimated an iPhone sell-through rate of about 225 million to 230 million units for the year. With some of the new features added, Ng's team sees a run rate closer to 250 million to 260 million units.\n\nThose estimates are driven not just by Apple Intelligence software but also by hardware changes to the phone itself.\n\n\"We're going to see several different form factor changes over the next several years,\" Ng said. \"The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have larger screen sizes than the iPhone 15, and the rumors for the next couple of years are that the iPhone 17 will be a thinner device [and] the iPhone 18 has the potential to be a foldable.\"\n\nStory continues An Apple event attendee inspects the new iPhone 16 Pro Max on Sept. 9, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nOthers think Apple's upgrade cycle may take longer to play out as Apple develops its AI capabilities.\n\n\"I just think there’s no compelling reason that somebody should run out and buy a new iPhone 16,\" Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance. \"You should wait for the [iPhone] 17 because it’s going to have … cooler stuff and there will be more gen. AI capability.\"\n\nApple stock's performance is currently in line with the Nasdaq year to date.

        "title": "This Is the Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Warren Buffett Owns (Hint: It's Not Apple)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days. The best investors on Wall Street have taken notice and are racing to acquire shares of some of the most prominent players in the field.\n\nWarren Buffett might not share the same enthusiasm as many investors and analysts. After being in the investing world for decades, it's hard to impress the Oracle of Omaha. Still, the conglomerate he chairs, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), owns shares in at least a couple of companies that have made key moves in AI, including Buffett's longtime favorite business (apart from his own): Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nHowever, the title of \"best AI stock\" in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio arguably goes to Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nAmazon versus Apple\n\nApple recently announced a suite of AI-related features that will be available to its customers, at least those who own some of its latest devices -- think the iPhone 15 Pro and above. It will also integrate ChatGPT in some of its devices, including its digital assistant, Siri.\n\nThese announcements were a long time coming. Apple was perceived as trailing other tech leaders in the AI race, including Amazon. The e-commerce specialist has been busy. Amazon released such services as Bedrock, which helps companies develop generative AI applications without deep coding knowledge.\n\nAmazon offers a host of AI-related services -- including Bedrock -- through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The list also includes Amazon Q, a GenAI assistant, Transcribe, which converts text to speech, and Translate, which does what its name suggests.\n\nAI is having an impact on AWS' revenue growth. In the second quarter, Amazon's net sales increased by 10% year over year to $148 billion. AWS revenue was up almost 19% year over year to $26.3 billion. Management attributed AWS' strong performance to three factors, one of which was AI.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon's CEO, says, \"Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days. But we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers.\"\n\nAmazon isn't done. In a move that could put it in a bit of a competition with the high-flying Nvidia, Amazon is designing its own AI chips. The company believes customers will benefit from customized options that are cheaper than what the runaway market leader Nvidia offers. How will this move impact Amazon's financial results? It's a bit early to say. However, the company's entire body of work in AI is much more advanced and comprehensive than Apple's.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore reasons to buy\n\nAmazon doesn't feature prominently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The conglomerate owned just 10 million shares of Amazon as of the second quarter. That sounds like a lot in a vacuum, but for comparison, it also owned 400 million Apple shares. Still, for investors who want a stock that is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and is a leader in AI, Amazon is a better option than Apple.\n\nAmazon isn't simply an AI play, however. AWS offers many non-AI-related services. It has been Amazon's most profitable segment for years, and there is still plenty of room to grow in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business isn't a particularly high-margin one. However, it benefits from a strong moat due to switching costs and the network effect. It also allows the company to generate billions in advertising.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\n\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company debuted the much-hyped iPhone 16 models earlier this week, launching the new models with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that the firm hopes will result in a stronger upcycle for the new phones. Apple Intelligence will be available on new iPhones by this October. Some AI features of the new product include letting users create new emoji by typing a description of what they want, or pulling photos and movies automatically to create a storyline. Other examples include letting Siri automatically delete duplicate photos or updating contact information, adding photos to an album or more.\n\nIn an investor note, analyst Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs had earlier pointed out that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock had historically underperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 70 bps on the day of the iPhone announcement. Ng backed the event this year expect to be similarly immaterial to the stock price. However, Ng acknowledged that some surprises might still have an impact on the share price, including a price increase in new iPhone models and the debut of some earlier-than-expected AI features.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Deciding to Sell Shares of This Well-Known Stock",
        "content": "Following the investment moves of billionaires isn't a foolproof strategy, but it can help inform your own decisions, as many of the top investors have gotten wealthy through their stock-picking abilities.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a popular stock to own among billionaires. The iPhone maker is once again the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. That's one reason the stock is appealing to the wealthiest investors. Many of them run hedge funds worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars, so they need to invest in companies that are big enough to move the needle.\n\nAnother is that Apple enjoys substantial competitive advantages thanks to its installed base of roughly 2 billion devices, dominant brand name in consumer electronics, and high-margin business like its App Store, which typically allows the company to collect 30% of money spent inside the apps.\n\nHowever, some investors seem to be turning bearish on the stock based on 13-F filings. Let's take a look at the top billionaire-led hedge funds that sold the stock in the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's sale of Apple was its biggest move in the quarter and surprised a number of Buffett watchers.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has long sung the praises of Apple, calling it his company's third business at one point, and complimenting the company on the strength of its businesses. Buffett hasn't directly addressed the reasons for the second-quarter Apple stock sale, in which Berkshire sold roughly 400 million shares of Apple, or $80 billion of the stock, slashing its stake in half.\n\nIn earlier comments, Buffett hinted that tax concerns were a reason for the sale. With talk in Washington about raising the capital gains tax rate, Buffett seems to have taken the opportunity to lock in Berkshire's massive gains in Apple, avoiding the risk of capital gains taxes going up.\n\nBuffett has also been raising cash by selling other stocks, a sign according to some that he may believe the stock market is overvalued.\n\n2. David Shaw's D.E. Shaw\n\nBillionaire David Shaw's D.E. Shaw hedge fund has long been a major shareholder in Apple, counting as a top holding for more than a decade. That investment has paid off handsomely over that time, as Apple is up roughly 10x.\n\nHowever, D.E. Shaw decided to trim that stake in the second quarter, selling 4.8 million shares of Apple, worth roughly $10 billion, leaving the company with 10 million shares of Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's unclear why Shaw sold the stock in the second quarter, but the firm may have believed that the stock had gotten overvalued after a run-up in the second quarter.\n\nApple is still D.E. Shaw's second-biggest holding, just behind Microsoft.\n\n3. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International\n\nFinally, the third billionaire who sold Apple stock in the second quarter was Jeff Yass.\n\nYass is known for holding a massive stake in TikTok. His Susquehanna firm is known for its quantitative approach.\n\nSusquehanna sold 2.6 million shares of Apple in the second quarter, worth roughly $500 million. That left Susquehanna with 6.2 million shares worth around $1.3 billion.\n\nSusquehanna's current portfolio is built around options positions in high-profile stocks, and its biggest stock holding is the S&P 500 SPDR ETF.\n\nShould you sell Apple?\n\nApple stock is pricey at the moment, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33, and the jury is still out on Apple Intelligence, which is yet to be released to the public. Apple's Glowtime event, during which it launched the iPhone 16, also failed to excite investors, as the stock finished Sept. 9 essentially flat.\n\nHowever, selling Apple stock seems like an overreaction at this point, especially with a potential sales surge on the way thanks to Apple Intelligence. Still, considering its valuation, the upside on the stock is likely limited at this point.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Little-Known Stock Instead",
        "content": "Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through intelligent acquisitions and prudent investments.\n\nAfter famously eschewing technology stocks for years, Berkshire surprised Wall Street in 2016 when it reported a stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Even more surprising were the subsequent share purchases that eventually made Apple its largest holding.\n\nLast year, Buffett referred to Apple as being a \"better business\" than any other Berkshire owned, but great businesses are not necessarily smart investments. Berkshire sold 389 million shares of Apple in the second quarter, cutting its stake in half, and the company started a small position in the lesser-known Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA).\n\nTo be clear, Berkshire still has 30% of its stock portfolio invested in Apple, but that represents a substantial reduction from 51% in the same quarter last year. Also noteworthy, Berkshire has allocated less than 1% of its portfolio to Ulta, but its novelty sets it apart from long-standing positions.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple reported solid financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 29). The company not only beat overall sales and earnings estimates, but also its sales exceeded expectations across every major product category except Macs. Revenue increased 5% to $85.8 billion, gross profit margin expanded 174 basis points, and GAAP net income increased 11% to $1.40 per diluted share.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple is well positioned to maintain similar momentum. The company has a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including personal computers and smartphones. It also has a strong presence in several service verticals. Apple has one of the fastest-growing advertising businesses and it operates the leading mobile app store. Last year, the App Store earned more than twice as much revenue as Alphabet's Google Play Store.\n\nHowever, Apple is also facing several headwinds. First, the Digital Markets Act in Europe forced the company to support third-party app stores on its devices, which could erode its dominance in the space. Second, Apple has lost so much smartphone share in China (its third largest market) that it no longer ranks among the top five vendors. Third, iPhones account for 45% of total revenue, but the company has yet to eclipse the iPhone sales record set in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nBuilding on that, Apple possesses tremendous brand authority in consumer electronics, but the company has not launched a new viral product since AirPods in 2017. If that continues, Apple will struggle to exceed mid-single digit sales growth. Earnings may grow faster because the company has historically spent heavily on stock buybacks. But earnings growth that is largely dependent on share repurchases is a sign of a company with limited prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nNothing I've mentioned so far is a deal-breaker, per se. The real problem lies in the disconnect between Apple's growth prospects and its current valuation. Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 8.6% annually over the next three years, which makes its valuation of 33.5 times earnings look outrageous. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 3.9, a substantial premium to three-year average of 2.6. The sky-high valuation may explain why Warren Buffett slashed his stake in Apple.\n\n2. Ulta Beauty\n\nUlta operates more than 1,400 stores across the United States, where it sells about 25,000 products spanning mass-market to high-end items from approximately 600 brands. Over the last few years, Ulta has secured a leadership position among U.S. beauty retailers due to store openings, effective marketing, compelling loyalty perks, and investments in e-commerce.\n\nUlta reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased less than 1% to $2.6 billion, and same-store sales actually declined 1%. Meanwhile, gross margin contracted 100 basis points, and GAAP earnings declined 11% to $5.30 per diluted share. Management also lowered its full-year outlook, such that evenue and earnings are forecasted to decline 1% and 11%, respectively.\n\nIn a recent note, Morningstar analyst David Swartz attributed Ulta's disappointing performance and guidance to competitive pressure, primarily arising from the rapid expansion of Sephora stores within Kohl's locations. But he thinks the company will turn things around. \"We forecast Ulta will expand its store base by about 20% over the next 10 years while achieving same-store sales growth of about 4%,\" he wrote.\n\nUlta is undoubtedly facing headwinds, but the stock is priced more reasonably than Apple. Wall Street expects earnings to increase at 9% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 15 times earnings seem fair. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.6, which is a slight premium to the three-year average of 1.5.\n\nI think patient investors can follow Berkshire's lead and buy a small position in Ulta stock today. But small is the key word. I would start with no more than 1% of my portfolio and build my position opportunistically during pullbacks. But investors should bear in mind that Ulta has failed to outperform the S&P 500 over the last three- and five-year periods.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn August 30, 2024, Morgan Stanley made a notable addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 51,656 shares of BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt (NYSE:BMN). This transaction increased the firm's total holdings in BMN to 633,065 shares, reflecting a strategic move to bolster its position in the asset management sector. The shares were purchased at a price of $25.05 each, marking a significant investment by Morgan Stanley in this non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.\n\nProfile of Morgan Stanley\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with GSL.\n\nMorgan Stanley, established in 1935, has evolved into a global financial services powerhouse with a presence in 42 countries. The firm operates through three main divisions: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management, offering a broad range of financial services and solutions. Morgan Stanley's commitment to innovation and expansion is evident from its history of strategic acquisitions and technological advancements. The firm's influence in the financial markets is substantial, with a focus on sectors like Technology and Financial Services. Morgan Stanley's Strategic Acquisition in BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt\n\nInvestment Strategy of Morgan Stanley\n\nMorgan Stanley's investment philosophy is centered around capitalizing on market inefficiencies and leveraging in-depth research to make informed investment decisions. The firm's top holdings include major technology companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), underscoring its preference for high-growth potential sectors. This recent acquisition of BMN shares aligns with Morgan Stanley's strategic focus on diversifying its portfolio and enhancing its offerings in the financial services sector.\n\nIntroduction to BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt\n\nBlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt aims to provide current income exempt from federal income tax, primarily through investment in quality municipal bonds. With a market capitalization of approximately $153.999 million, BMN represents a targeted investment approach within the asset management industry. This focus on tax-exempt income makes BMN an attractive option for investors seeking stable, tax-efficient returns.\n\nFinancial and Market Analysis of BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt\n\nAs of the latest data, BMN's stock price stands at $25.05 with a PE ratio of 17.32, indicating a moderate valuation relative to earnings. The stock has experienced a year-to-date price increase of 5.34%, although it has seen a slight decline of 0.24% since its IPO. BMN's financial strength and market performance, however, reflect some challenges, with a low GF Score of 18/100, suggesting potential underperformance in the future.\n\nStory continues Morgan Stanley's Strategic Acquisition in BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt\n\nImpact of the Trade on Morgan Stanley's Portfolio\n\nThe acquisition of additional shares in BMN significantly bolsters Morgan Stanley's exposure to the asset management sector, particularly in tax-advantaged investments. Although BMN currently represents a small fraction of Morgan Stanley's vast portfolio, this move could signal a strategic interest in expanding its presence in specialized financial segments.\n\nMarket Implications of the Transaction\n\nThe timing of Morgan Stanley's increased stake in BMN may reflect a strategic response to evolving market conditions, where tax-efficient investments are increasingly valued amidst fluctuating economic indicators. This acquisition not only enhances Morgan Stanley's portfolio diversity but also positions the firm to capitalize on potential tax policy changes and municipal bond market dynamics.\n\nConclusion\n\nMorgan Stanley's recent acquisition of shares in BlackRock 2037 Mun Tgt underscores its strategic investment approach, focusing on both growth potential and market stability. This transaction not only diversifies its portfolio but also enhances its offerings in the financial services sector, potentially setting the stage for future growth in asset management investments.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Overview of Vanguard's Recent Transaction\n\nOn August 30, 2024, Vanguard Group Inc made a notable addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 566,103 shares of Cable One Inc (NYSE:CABO). This transaction, executed at a price of $352.72 per share, reflects a strategic move by the firm, although it did not significantly alter the overall composition of Vanguard's extensive portfolio. The shares acquired represent a 10.07% position in Cable One within Vanguard's holdings, underscoring a substantial commitment to this specific asset.\n\nInsight into Vanguard Group Inc\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with CABO.\n\nFounded in 1975 by John C. Bogle, Vanguard Group Inc has grown into a leading global investment firm, renowned for its low-cost mutual funds and ETFs. The firm's investment philosophy centers on providing high-value, low-cost investment opportunities to its clients, which now number over 20 million worldwide.

The firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a strong inclination towards technology and financial services sectors. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Cable One Inc Shares\n\nCable One Inc at a Glance\n\nCable One Inc, a key player in the telecommunications sector, primarily generates revenue through broadband, voice, and video services. With a market capitalization of $1.77 billion and a diverse range of services, Cable One has established a robust business model. The company's financial health is reflected in its high Profitability Rank and consistent revenue growth, making it a significant entity in the telecommunications industry. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Cable One Inc Shares\n\nImpact of Vanguard's Investment in Cable One\n\nThe recent acquisition by Vanguard does not markedly shift the firm's overall investment strategy but reinforces its commitment to diversifying into stable telecommunications assets. Despite the substantial number of shares purchased, this move aligns with Vanguard's broader portfolio objectives, focusing on sectors that promise sustainable growth and stability.\n\nMarket Performance and Sector Analysis\n\nCable One's current market valuation and its performance metrics such as a PE ratio of 7.41 indicate a challenging market perception, labeled as a \"Possible Value Trap\" by GuruFocus. The telecommunications sector, while stable, presents unique challenges and opportunities which Vanguard seems prepared to navigate given its strategic asset allocation.\n\nStory continues\n\nImplications for the Market and Other Investors\n\nVanguard's investment in Cable One could signal a bullish outlook on the telecommunications sector, potentially influencing other investors to reevaluate their positions in similar stocks.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other buzzing stocks.\n\nStock Market Volatility\n\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\n\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500’s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\n\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\n\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed’s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\n\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it’s only 1-2%, then that’s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\n\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Most Buzzing Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nVolume: 43.617 million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 63.905 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm, known as the company behind iPhones. These iPhones alone make up 46% of the company’s net sales. It also offers services including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nIn FQ3 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI, integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models.\n\nIt plans to launch the next generation of the iPhone lineup in September. This annual event is receiving a lot of attention because the company is expected to unveil new AI features for these phones. Lagging iPhone sales in recent years have slowed the revenue growth for the company, and this AI upgrade is expected to change its growth outlook. However, even more advanced AI features will not roll out earlier than 2025.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is eyeing a major investment in OpenAI, along with NVIDIA, as part of a funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value OpenAI at $100 billion.\n\nThe revenue for this fiscal quarter was up 4.87% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also a great choice for ESG investors, given its commitment to labor rights, environmental responsibility, and ethical business practices. It has reduced its overall greenhouse gas emissions by over 55% since 2015, marking progress toward its 2030 goal of achieving carbon neutrality across its entire value chain.\n\nCurrently, 184 hedge funds are long in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Berkshire Hathaway has the highest stake in the company, with a position of $84,248,000,000.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list the most buzzing stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple announced an array of new features in its latest product lineup this week, including innovations to the iPhone maker's new generation of the AirPods Pro that could be a game changer — and a bargain — for people with hearing loss.\n\nThe AirPods Pro 2, which will be available starting Sept. 20, doubles as a hearing aid for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. And at $245, it could serve as an alternative to prescription hearing aids that can cost thousands of dollars. Apple's new AirPods Pro add a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with mild to moderate hearing loss.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are more than 1.5 billion people now living with hearing loss, and Apple's own research found that only a fraction of those folks are receiving care for their condition.\n\nAPPLE ADDING AI FEATURES TO IPHONE, OTHER PRODUCTS\n\nSo, the tech giant developed a Hearing Test feature for users, too, which provides a summary of their results that can be stored in their Health App and shared with their health care provider, along with a customized hearing profile for Airpods Pro. Apple says users can fine-tune their experience at any time with the Hearing Aid feature.\n\n\"Hearing health is an essential part of our overall wellbeing, yet it can often be overlooked — in fact, according to the Apple Hearing Study, a staggering 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss go untreated,\" said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAPPLE UNVEILS THE IPHONE 16\n\n\"We’re thrilled to provide breakthrough software features with AirPods Pro that put users’ hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss,\" Desai added. A glowing Apple logo is seen at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, before the start of an innovation event on Sept. 9.\n\nApple's new hearing aid feature comes two years after the Food and Drug Administration finalized a historic ruling allowing hearing aids to be sold over-the-counter, improving access to hearing aids for people with perceived mild-to moderate hearing loss by eliminating the need for a medical exam, prescription or a fitting adjustment by an audiologist.\n\nBut since the new rules, the hearing aid market has become increasingly competitive.\n\nSeveral retailers now offer over-the-counter hearing aids, and last year, Apple's rival, Google, announced a partnership with various organizations in health care service delivery and research technology to develop personalized hearing aids using artificial intelligence.\n\nFOX Business' Bradford Betz and Daniella Genovese contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple's new AirPods Pro double as hearing aids\n\nView comments",

        "content": "China Is Eating Apple's Lunch: Where Smartphone Maker Ranks Vs Asian Competitors\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is losing its mojo in China’s crucial market as its domestic players gain ground. The uncertainty regarding the availability of the Apple Intelligence feature in the country is an additional downer.\n\nThe iPhone maker’s market share in China plunged to sixth place from third in the second quarter of 2024. According to Canalys, Apple had a market share of 14%, down by two basis points year-on-year.\n\nAlso Read: China’s Markets Still Manage To Get Nvidia AI Chips Via Smuggling: Report\n\nChina’s smartphone shipment grew 10% year-on-year to over 70 million units in the second quarter. Vivo emerged as the number one with a 19% market share by shipping 13.1 million units, up by 15% year-on-year, driven by solid performance in offline channels and robust online sales during the Chinese e-commerce festival.\n\nOPPO remained in second position with a 16% market share after shipping 11.3 million units. HONOR came third with a market share of 15%, backed by shipments of 10.7 million units, implying a 4% growth year-on-year.\n\nHuawei Technologies Co bagged the fourth position with a 15% market share supported by shipments of 10.6 million units, which grew by 41% year-on-year. Xiaomi Corp (OTC:XIACF) (OTC:XIACY) came fifth with a market share of 14%, backed by a 17% year-on-year shipment increase to 10 million units.\n\nCanalys attributed the local brands’ success to the early significant discounts and promotions backed by offline channel enhancements.\n\nThe local brands continue to tap the Chinese premium smartphone market by integrating generative artificial intelligence, and their deep collaboration with regional supply chains is a significant advantage, Canalys noted.\n\nCanalys also flagged Apple’s struggle to maintain adequate inventory levels, keep retail prices in check, and maintain the margins of channel partners.\n\nHuawei’s $2,800 Mate XT trifold phone launching on September 20 coincides with the release of the iPhone 16 models. Apple’s iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199, while the standard iPhone 16 is $799.\n\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) expects global smartphone shipments to increase by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, marking a recovery with generative AI posing as a significant catalyst.\n\nHowever, due to higher competition in China, Android growth is expected to beat Apple iOS. As per IDC, Apple’s success hinges on its capability to forge local AI partnerships in China.\n\nIvan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research told SCMP that iPhone market share in the premium segment will likely decline as Huawei and other Chinese brands gain traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has not yet revealed its plans for AI integration in China, which could place it at a disadvantage in the race to implement AI, SCMP cites Canalys analyst Lucas Zhong. However, Lam noted that pent-up demand for iPhone upgrades may still boost sales in China.\n\nPrice Action: AAPL stock closed at $222.66 on Wednesday.\n\nimage via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article China Is Eating Apple's Lunch: Where Smartphone Maker Ranks Vs Asian Competitors originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Apple’s big health updates are impressive and meant to keep users coming back for years",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Intelligence AI platform stole the show at the company’s “Glowtime” iPhone event on Monday. But a pair of health features the company unveiled point to Apple’s continued push into the healthcare space and may prove just as important to keeping users around as its AI efforts.\n\nThe capabilities, sleep apnea detection for the Apple Watch and a hearing aid function for the AirPods Pro 2, aren’t yet ready for consumers — they still need approval from global health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — but Apple expects them to be available in the coming weeks.\n\nThe tech giant’s deeper moves into health tracking are just the latest in its quest to become a major player in the industry. As far back as 2019, CEO Tim Cook said Apple’s greatest contribution to mankind will be in health.\n\nSo it makes sense that the company would add features to some of its most popular products, the AirPods Pro 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2, that address well-known health problems. Apple says that an estimated 1 billion people around the world have sleep apnea, a disorder that causes breathing disruptions while sleeping and can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease, but the majority of those individuals don’t know they have it. In its own study, Apple said that 75% of people diagnosed with hearing loss aren’t getting the necessary support they need for it. Apple Watches are displayed during an announcement of new products at Apple headquarters Monday, Sept. 9, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple is quick to point out that sleep apnea detection isn’t meant to diagnose the condition, but is to be used as a guide to alert you to potential sleep problems that you can bring to your doctor to discuss further testing. The Apple Watch tracks your sleep by detecting micro-movements via its built-in accelerometer.\n\nApple says it submitted the largest ever study on sleep apnea technology to the FDA to validate the watch’s detection capabilities. During its testing of 1,500 people, the company says its sleep apnea detection didn’t alert on a single person that didn’t at least show signs of mild sleep apnea and that it hit on about two-thirds of true sleep apnea cases.\n\nSleep apnea detection requires users to wear their watches for at least 10 nights over a 30-day period. The more you wear it during that time, the better. Apple will display results in a new breathing disturbances tab in the Health app, showing if you’re dealing with any breathing disruptions throughout the night.\n\nIf you’ve experienced enough sleep disturbances, the Health app will alert you that you’re showing signs of sleep apnea. Your breathing can change for any number of reasons from night to night, whether that’s due to a cold or drinking alcohol. Requiring users to wear their watches for 10 nights should help account for those outlier situations.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’ve got sleep apnea and sleep with a CPAP mask every night. But I spent years experiencing awful sleep problems without knowing what the problem was. It took both my former editor and my wife to convince me to go take a sleep test and find out I had an issue. Having the Apple Watch’s alerts would have saved me a lot of time wondering whether I should go to the doctor or not. Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are getting an update to help users with hearing difficulties. (Ming Yeung/Getty Images) (Ming Yeung via Getty Images)\n\nApple’s hearing protection and aid feature for the AirPods Pro 2 is similarly impressive. The option will be available via a software update and include the ability to take a five-minute test to determine if you have a form of hearing loss.\n\nI tried a brief sample of the test: It lasted less than a minute, during which I had to tap the screen each time I heard a beep in my left ear and then my right. It was kind of like the hearing tests you took in school.\n\nI didn’t get to test the hearing aid feature itself, but Apple is positioning it as a replacement for over-the-counter hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Users with severe hearing problems will still need purpose-built hearing aids.\n\nStill, offering a hearing test and over-the-counter-equivalent hearing aid option to consumers could prove to be incredibly helpful to people around the world who otherwise might not realize they even have hearing problems.\n\nApple’s features also act as another way for the company to both draw new users and keep its existing customers from leaving for competing offerings from Samsung and Google, even if Samsung already offers sleep apnea detection in its own smartwatch.\n\nThe idea is for Apple to prove that its products are invaluable devices that you shouldn’t be without. And with its latest offerings, it seems to do just that. We’ll see how consumers react when Apple releases updates for sleep apnea detection and hearing protection and aids in the weeks ahead.

        "title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Dumps Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), But Another Billionaire Is Buying",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn’t mean he’d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang’s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.\n\nBack in May, Druckenmiller explained why he’s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he’s had a “hell of a run” and he now “just needs a break.”\n\nHowever, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could “rhythm” with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the “incremental payoff” of AI investments is coming by the “day.”\n\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Stake Value: $5,139,000 (-79% From the First Quarter)\n\nBen Reitzes, Melius Research’s head of technology research, said while talking to CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a “generational” upgrade cycle.\n\n“First, the installed base of phones is old. So, we have that going for us. Then, Apple Intelligence only works on the newer phones.”\n\nThe analyst said that he’s very “upbeat” on Apple shares. Asked about Buffett selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, he said he might have “other motivations.”\n\nBen Reitzes said that he believes Apple’s upgrade cycle would peak in 2026 and Wall Street expectations for Apple are easily beatable.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’ suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,  iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.”\n\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they’d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a “fundamental shift” in the industry.\n\n“I know it’s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.”\n\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a “digestion” period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\n\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\n\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new “all-time record highs.”\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings.

Both Apple and Ireland appealed the ruling, which was annulled in 2020, but the EC appealed that decision and won the final ruling on Tuesday.\n\nEU REGULATOR WARNS MUSK AGAINST X AMPLIFYING ‘HARMFUL CONTENT’ AHEAD OF TRUMP INTERVIEW\n\nApple said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling.\n\n\"This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to,\" the statement read, in part. \"We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas on Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nThe case against Alphabet-owned Google stems back to 2017, when the EC issued a fine against the world's largest search engine for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an allegedly unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.\n\nA lower tribunal had endorsed the EU competition enforcer's decision in 2021, prompting Google to appeal. In siding with the EC on Tuesday, the judges on Europe's high court determined that EU law does not sanction the existence of a dominant position, but its abusive exploitation.\n\nDOJ ALLEGES GOOGLE MAINTAINS AN ‘ILLEGAL MONOPOLY’ OVER AD TECHNOLOGY\n\n\"In particular, the conduct of undertakings in a dominant position that has the effect of hindering competition on the merits and is thus likely to cause harm to individual undertakings and consumers is prohibited,\" they said.\n\nGoogle expressed disappointment over the ruling. A spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal, \"This judgment relates to a very specific set of facts. We made changes back in 2017 to comply with the European Commission’s decision.\"\n\nThe EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, took a victory lap over the rulings against the American tech giants on social media.\n\nIn separate posts on X on Tuesday, Vestager called the Apple ruling \"a huge win for European citizens and tax justice,\" and the Google decision \"a big win for digital fairness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple, Google owe whopping tax bills due to EU's crackdown on Big Tech\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ireland’s special relationship with Apple and Google has created a multibillion-dollar windfall—and an existential crisis",
        "content": "Ireland’s €13 billion windfall from a European court tussle with Apple looks on the surface like a boost to the country’s already-inflated coffers. But, in reality, it has created a new headache for an economy with more money than sense.\n\nOn Monday, the EU ruled Apple had to pay Ireland €13 billion in unpaid taxes, concluding an eight-year battle for the bloc that received little help from Ireland.\n\nThe money adds to Ireland’s substantial government surplus without leaving it any nearer to figuring out how it could spend those funds and what it means for the country’s deeply entrenched relationship with U.S. tech giants.\n\nHow Ireland got here\n\nIreland attracted many tech companies at the start of the century after the country lowered its corporation tax rate to 12.5%.\n\nAfter being hobbled by the global financial crash and receiving €67.5 billion in loans from the EU, the country doubled down on attractive incentives for tech groups while enacting painful austerity measures on its citizens.\n\nThe investment created an economic windfall for Ireland that wasn’t everything it appeared.\n\nIrish GDP grew by more than 26% in 2016 after Apple restructured to place patents and intellectual property in the country, leading Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman to label the growth figures “Leprechaun Economics.”\n\nThe country’s statistics organization had to create a new measure of economic growth due to the inflated accounts of tech groups in the country, which were paying minimal taxes.\n\nThe Central Statistics Office introduced modified gross national income, which, among other things removes the net factor income of redomiciled public companies, including Apple and Google.\n\nIn 2023, Irish modified GNI (Gross National Income) was just 55% of its €510 billion GDP output.\n\nStill, the country’s government has praised the tech windfall's economic benefits, notably infrastructure improvements in Ireland and high-value job creation.\n\nBut the country’s tech ecosystem is facing a reckoning.\n\nThe EU’s ruling against Apple was a landmark judgment following a battle that whirred from 2016, when Apple’s contributions to the Irish economy came into focus.\n\nIreland spent €10 million of government funds on legal fees defending Apple’s tax situation in country before the EU ruled against the tech giant.\n\nMeanwhile, the country doesn’t quite know what to do with the economic benefits it has gained from its past special relationship with U.S. tech.\n\nBarriers to spending\n\nBefore the EU court ruled against Ireland, the country was already trying to figure out what to do with a mammoth €8.6 billion surplus.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Irish government has plenty of pain points that could do with a multi-billion euro injection. The Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil coalition also have the incentive of an election due next year to woo voters. But the figures are eyewatering even for Ireland’s inflated coffers, as are the timelines for improvement.\n\nAn all-island rail review, which includes neighboring Northern Ireland, says a €37 billion investment was required over 25 years to update the island’s network.\n\nThe country also needs to unleash a major housebuilding project, as four people are born for every new home built in the country, and affordability declines faster than many major economies like the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nThe main Irish opposition party, Sinn Féin has pledged €39 billion to a housing plan if it is elected next year.\n\nDetractors have argued that a spending spree risks overheating an economy still trying to recover from generationally high inflation. Others have argued the funds should be set aside for a rainy day when it is urgently needed, with the nearly €70 billion of state aid in 2010 still fresh in policymakers’ minds.\n\nIreland announced last year the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, a la Norway, which was expected to grow to more than €100 billion by the mid-2030s. Ireland intends to reinvest its vast economic reserves in future pension provisions and long-term infrastructure needs.\n\nDanny McCoy, the CEO of Ibec, Ireland’s main business lobby, warns that future business growth is a risk to Ireland, but he argues that this only increases the urgency to invest now.\n\n“Ibec and our members are extremely optimistic about the resources available to the next government and what can be achieved,” McCoy wrote.\n\n“However, it is conceivable that future governments may not have the same level of resources available as the next one. Therefore, now is the time to address the challenges that have been the Achilles' heel of growth, such as the long and drawn-out nature of infrastructure delivery, poor public services, and housing issues.”\n\nThe Apple issue also weighs on Ireland’s mind. The FT reported that other European countries with an interest in Apple may stake a claim to the tax judgment brought by the EU.\n\nIt may raise questions about Apple’s tax arrangements with other U.S. tech companies, particularly Google.\n\nThe Irish government has vast levels of corporation tax in part to thank for its huge surplus, which has been growing for the last few years. The government argues this is volatile and unlikely to grow at its previous pace. That decline could be expedited by wary multinationals.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe Irish government hasn’t opposed the EU’s ruling, and has pointed out it is only of historical significance as its current tax policies fall in line with the bloc’s requirements.\n\nThe government may grumble behind the scenes at the potential pyrrhic victory of a €13 billion windfall that reminds tech giants that Ireland isn’t the tax haven it was for the last two decades.\n\nHowever, there is also an argument that the longer Ireland puts off much-needed infrastructure developments, the less attractive it becomes as a hub for companies looking for sustainable growth in the country.\n\n“The biggest risk to multinationals now in Ireland, is they leave because our transport infrastructure and housing costs are so abysmal,” Irish economist David McWilliams said on his podcast.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple picks the low-hanging fruit in iPhone unveil: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nApple's (AAPL) unveiling of the iPhone 16 Monday shows the company is sticking to the basics when it comes to new product launches rather than diving headfirst into the AI horse race.\n\nAs our Dan Howley noted, the company is shooting its AI shot carefully, slowly, and deliberately, lest its AI, dubbed Apple Intelligence, make a bad first impression and poison the AI well.\n\nBut read another way, Monday's presentation showed a company unwilling to rush tech it hasn’t found the right use for — and in the meantime is doubling down on its marketing and user-experience prowess, making the banal suddenly seem compelling.\n\nAlongside the slick but incremental-feeling AI features, the company launched AirPods with hearing aid functionality, an Apple Watch that now can detect sleep apnea, and a phone with a satellite connection for emergencies, wrapping three long-standing tech devices in a package of its signature branding, instinctive user experience, and already well-known products.\n\nIt’s as if the company is picking low-hanging fruit instead of trying to prematurely cull the still-ripening AI crop hanging from the canopy’s branches.\n\nApple has been trying to figure out its next moves since at least 2016, when sales of the iPhone began to level out as people started to keep their old phones, which were still working just fine. Incremental improvements in camera and screen quality stopped being noticeable — and certainly weren’t asked for. The yearly chorus of “best battery ever” stopped hitting as hard when batteries actually kept working after the two-year mark.\n\nWith its hardware working too well to be replaced, Apple had to lean into other parts of its growing suite of offerings, especially services.\n\nInvestors hope that artificial intelligence will solve the hardware sales problem for Apple, as they hope the technology will do for a suite of other things. But many still see the current and near-term embodiments of AI as a solution in search of a problem — cool functionality, perhaps, but with a currently nebulous use case for most businesses, let alone consumers.\n\nThe two buzzy letters got plenty of attention, but the event’s shared billing of AI and the suite of safety features makes it clear that Apple is keeping its portfolio diverse, AI expectations managed, and focus firmly on the company’s ecosystem and services. As Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote, the new devices \"focus on driving more users to the ecosystem,” and while the phones cost the same (a nod to tamed inflation?), the sat phone feature will become another revenue stream once the free two-year trial ends.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has long been the GOAT in taking challenging technology and putting it into a consumer-friendly wrapper. Computers, MP3 players, tablets, phones, smartwatches, smart TVs, wireless headphones — it’s an all-time record.\n\nAI may also be in this category, existing already but for the most part being a B2B conversation. But as Apple well knows, so are an array of decades-old tech products that have never quite made it into the consumer space.\n\nI had to dig a hole the other day and found a pipe in the way. I look forward to the iPhone 17’s metal detector.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 11, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nApple Unveils AI-Powered iPhone 16: Buy, Sell or Hold AAPL Stock?\n\nApple unveiled the AI-powered iPhone 16 line-up of devices on Monday. The iPhone maker introduced Apple Watch Series 10, as well as AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2.\n\nThe new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are powered by the new A18 chip, delivering better performance and efficiency, as well as a big boost in battery life. Both models feature Camera Control that includes a 48MP Fusion camera with a 2 times Telephoto option.\n\nThe premium iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are powered by an A18 Pro chip. These devices feature a new 48MP Fusion camera with a faster quad-pixel sensor that enables 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision.\n\nThe devices feature Apple Intelligence, which Apple unveiled at its annual developers’ event. It is an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1. It will be available from next month.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to be a game changer for AAPL stock, driving iPhone sales. However, is that enough to attract investors?\n\nLet’s analyze the role Apple Intelligence is expected to play in driving Apple’s prospects.\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nWill Apple Intelligence Aid AAPL Stock’s Prospects?\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple’s stringent privacy standards.\n\nApple Intelligence will be first available in U.S. English and will be expanded quickly to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. in December. Additional language support – Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish will be available next year.\n\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, becomes more natural, contextually aware and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new writing tool helps users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text everywhere, including mail, notes, pages and third-party apps.\n\nPhoto features get enhancement as the Movie feature now allows users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. The new Clean Up tool identifies and removes distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject.\n\nApple has integrated ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nAI Focus & Services to Aid AAPL’s Top-Line Growth\n\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nAlthough Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged its strong growth driver. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.\n\nApple expects the September-end quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as the June-end quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nApple Shares Overvalued\n\nThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nAAPL Shares Trade at a Premium\n\nApple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 29.43X compared with the sector’s 24.76X and higher than the median of 27.68X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nApple Underperforms Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 23.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s appreciation of 23.9%.\n\nWhat Should Investors Do With AAPL Stock?\n\nApple’s AI push is attractive for growth-oriented investors. The Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive.\n\nHowever, Apple’s sluggish China business has been a headache. Greater China sales decreased 6.5% year over year to $14.73 billion, accounting for 17.2% of total sales in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Huawei's tri-foldable phone stirs Chinese pride but $2,800 price tag panned",
        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Huawei's new tri-foldable smartphone has ignited nationalistic pride in China with social media abuzz with what supporters see as its ability to out-innovate Apple despite U.S. sanctions - even if many are balking at the phone's $2,800 price tag.\n\nThe Chinese technology giant unveiled its Mate XT, the industry's first tri-foldable phone, on Tuesday just hours after Apple introduced its artificial intelligence-enhanced iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nBoth the Mate XT and iPhone 16 will go on sale on Sept. 20, though the Mate XT is expected to be available only in China.\n\n\"Apple hasn't fallen, but Huawei has truly risen again,\" commented one user on Weibo, China's equivalent to X.\n\nAnother wrote: \"Times are changing. U.S. sanctions have been in vain.\"\n\nA video that purports to show Apple store employees in China going to a Huawei store to watch the Huawei product launch also became the No. 2 trending item on Weibo for 13 hours, garnering 91 million views and more than 6,600 comments.\n\nThe launch of the Mate XT follows Huawei's re-emergence in the 5G premium smartphone market last year with its Mate 60 series and this year with its high-end Pura series phones that have domestically produced semiconductors.\n\nAll have been celebrated in China as a triumph over U.S. sanctions that have, since 2019, prevented the company from accessing advanced U.S. chips and other technology.\n\nWashington sees Huawei as a national security risk - a charge that the company denies. U.S. sanctions have since broadened out to encompass export bans on highly advanced U.S. chips to all Chinese firms with Washington seeking to impede advances in technology for China's military.\n\nHuawei fans also noted that Apple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power its iPhone 16 product range and Apple Intelligence, the company's AI software, will only be available in Chinese next year.\n\nNationalistic pride notwithstanding, the Mate XT's starting price of 19,999 yuan was widely criticised as beyond the reach of ordinary consumers and insensitive at a time of sluggish economic growth when ordinary citizens are struggling with financial insecurity.\n\nVersions with more sophisticated features such as larger memory will cost as much as 23,999 yuan ($3,300).\n\nA Weibo poll on the Mate XT showed that only 966 of some 9,200 respondents said they planned to buy it. More than 4,700 said they were put off by the price while another 3,500 said they were not considering purchasing it at the moment.\n\n\"No matter how much I like the product, the price tag just sounds crazy to me,\" said a person surnamed Xu at a Beijing Huawei store, describing himself as a Huawei loyalist.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Maybe Huawei isn't really targeting people like me,\" he added.\n\n($1 = 7.1138 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Edwina Gibbs)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Recent Reduction in Bank of America Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 10, 2024, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm made a notable adjustment in its investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). This transaction involved the sale of 5,797,093 shares at a price of $39.45 each. Following this trade, the firm still holds a substantial number of shares, totaling 858,180,506, which represents a 12.1% position in its portfolio and an 11.06% ownership in the bank itself.\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio): Investment Titan\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a legendary figure in the investment world. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has transformed a modest textile company into a major conglomerate, primarily focusing on insurance and other diverse investments. His investment philosophy, deeply rooted in Benjamin Graham's principles of value investing, emphasizes understanding a business deeply, investing with a margin of safety, and choosing companies with long-term value. Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings include major names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and American Express Co (NYSE:AXP), highlighting a strong inclination towards financially sound companies.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with XYL.\n\nDetails of the Trade Action\n\nThe recent sale marks a slight reduction in Buffett's holdings in Bank of America, decreasing by approximately 0.67%, with a minor portfolio impact of -0.08%. Despite this reduction, Bank of America remains a significant part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, reflecting Buffett's ongoing confidence in the financial sector.\n\nBank of America at a Glance\n\nBank of America is one of the leading financial institutions in the U.S., with operations spanning across consumer banking, global wealth management, and investment banking. As of now, the bank boasts a market capitalization of approximately $304.8 billion and maintains a P/E ratio of 13.83, indicating a stable financial standing. The stock is currently priced at $39.28, closely aligning with the GuruFocus Value of $38.37, suggesting it is fairly valued.\n\nMarket and Sector Analysis\n\nBank of America plays a pivotal role in the financial services sector, a top area of focus for Buffett's investments. The stock's current valuation metrics and its significant position in Buffett's portfolio underscore its importance within the sector and its potential influence on Berkshire Hathaway's overall investment strategy.\n\nPerformance Metrics and Future Outlook\n\nBank of America holds a GF Score of 80/100, indicating good potential for future performance. The bank's financial strength and profitability are adequately positioned, with a Growth Rank of 7/10 and a Profitability Rank of 6/10. Looking forward, the bank's strategic positioning and steady financial metrics suggest a stable outlook, which likely contributes to its maintained presence in Buffett's portfolio.\n\nGF-Score\n\nBroader Impact of Buffett's Trade\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s trading actions invariably set ripples across the investment community, influencing other major investors and market trends. Notably, other significant investors in Bank of America include Dodge & Cox, Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio), and Richard Pzena (Trades, Portfolio), who may also react to these changes in Buffett's strategy. This trade, while minor in terms of portfolio impact, reaffirms Buffett's cautious approach to portfolio management and his focus on value investing principles.\n\nConclusion\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent reduction in Bank of America shares reflects a strategic portfolio adjustment rather than a shift in investment philosophy. As the market continues to monitor Buffett's moves, the enduring value approach of Berkshire Hathaway remains a central theme in understanding these investment decisions.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Harris Says Trump ‘Sold Us Out’ to China, Slams His Praise of Xi",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Kamala Harris slammed her presidential rival Donald Trump for not protecting American interests against China, and lambasted his public praise for Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the global pandemic.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus Rome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain\n\n“Under Donald Trump’s presidency, he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military,” Harris said during a televized debate on Tuesday evening.\n\n“Policy about China should be making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century,” Vice President Harris added, claiming that Trump “sold us out” during his time in office.\n\nChina has become a top target during the US election, with Trump vowing to impose a 60% tariff and the Biden administration announcing a 100% levy on Chinese-made electric cars. Beijing has, so far, resisted any move that could backfire on the world’s second-largest economy, and not made clear which candidate it prefers.\n\nWhile Trump placed tariffs on more than $300 billion of Chinese goods as president and sought to block countries from buying Huawei Technologies Co. equipment for 5G networks, his opponent’s stance is lesser known after she joined the ticket late. The debate gave Harris a chance to flesh out her policy in comments likely to be closely watched in Beijing.\n\nChina was a recurring theme with Harris taking swipes at Trump for displays of admiration for Xi, whom President Joe Biden has publicly called a “dictator.”\n\n“He actually thanked President Xi for what he did during Covid. Look at his tweet — ‘Thank you, President Xi. Exclamation point,’” Harris said. “We know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of Covid.”\n\nTrump commended the world’s No. 2 economy for its “efforts and transparency” in containing the virus on Jan. 25, 2020, at the pandemic’s dawn as the trade war was winding down. “It will all work out well,” he posted, thanking Xi on behalf of the American people.\n\nTrade policy was another talking point. The Republican indicated again that he’d further hike tariffs on China if elected in November, a policy Harris criticized as bad for American consumers. The Federal Reserve has been trying to cool US inflation, an effort that frustrating access to cheap Chinese goods could hinder.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump defended his record, claiming Biden had kept his China curbs because they generated too much revenue to give up. He also pledged to clamp down on Chinese firms he said were building car plants in Mexico to skirt tariffs and flood the US market.\n\nThe sparring come amid “China Week” in the US House, as it votes on a swath of legislation clamping down on ties with Beijing. American lawmakers earlier this week passed a bill to blacklist Chinese biotech companies and their US subsidiaries.\n\nHarris is largely expected to continue Biden’s approach of managing ties through “intensive diplomacy,” while rallying US partners to limit China’s access to cutting-edge chips on national security concerns.\n\nAmid the back and forth, Trump called Harris the “worst vice president in the history of our country.” The Democrat criticized her rival for, among other things, inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David, in apparent reference to a meeting that was ultimately canceled in 2019.\n\n“You adore strong men instead of caring about democracy,” Harris told her challenger.\n\n--With assistance from Michelle Jamrisko.\n\n(Updates with more details and Trump’s tweet)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Global tech giants halved their business flight emissions in 2023 compared to 2019, but companies like Apple and Google's parent Alphabet are falling behind, risking a return to pre-pandemic levels, a Brussels-based NGO said in a report.\n\nBusiness travel last year approached pre-pandemic levels but trailed behind leisure trips, as geopolitical conflicts and a slower rebound in key markets hindered full recovery.\n\nEmissions from corporate flights by 26 major tech companies analysed by Travel Smart, a campaign led by Transport & Environment (T&E) dropped by an average of 49% in 2023, it found.\n\nWhile this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.\n\nAlphabet, which has not set a goal to cut emissions, and Apple, which set a broader target, are slowly creeping back toward 2019 levels, T&E said.\n\nThe two were among the worst performers, with reductions in corporate travel emissions of just 23% and 31% in 2023, respectively.\n\n\"How can (Google chief) Sundar Pichai say that Google is progressing to a sustainable future when its travel emissions are going in the wrong direction?\" said Denise Auclair, corporate travel manager at T&E.\n\nMicrosoft, IBM, and SAP, despite significant cuts, are also at risk as they are among the companies that fly the most without having set reduction goals, T&E said.\n\n\"Tech companies have claimed to be climate leaders for a long time and many have substantially reduced their business travel emissions, but if they want to be credible they must set reduction targets,\" Auclair added.\n\nAsked about its performance, Apple said it has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% since 2015 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\n\"We're achieving this by making reductions across our entire carbon footprint — including business travel — and implementing significant cuts to the largest sources of our emissions,\" a spokesperson for Apple told Reuters.\n\nOther companies were not immediately available for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Dagmarah Mackos; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

As per the data, some hedge funds that were using long-short equity strategies have started to fight the rally.\n\nDuring extreme market volatility, short selling has become pronounced and has drawn significant interest from institutional and retail investors. It has prompted regulatory intervention as new reporting requirements have been issued by the SEC to offer transparency and ensure the availability of short position data.\n\nRecent Trends in Short Selling\n\nIn the 2Q 2024, the US and Canadian markets saw an increase of ~$58 billion in short interest or a rise of 5.1% from the previous quarter.\n\nRecently, S3 Partners, a renowned tracker of short-interest data, reported that the sectors that saw the largest increases in short exposure in 2Q 2024 included information technology (a rise of $49.3 billion), communication services (at $11.2 billion), and utilities (a rise of $3.7 billion) from the previous quarter. The sectors that saw the largest decrease in short exposure were the energy and financial sectors, down $12.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n\nEarlier in 2024, a significant surge in the leading AI giant resulted in losses of ~$3 billion for the short sellers. Some market experts even described this as an “AI-generated nightmare.”\n\nIn global equities, short interest climbed during July 2024, with strong increases seen throughout the Automobile (+13bps), REITs (+11bps), and Consumer Durables (+11bps) sectors, reported S&P Global. On the other hand, the largest decreases were in the Financial Services (-10bps) and Real Estate Management and Development (-4bps) sectors.\n\nTalking about the US equities, the average short interest decreased to 77 basis points during July 2024. Significant increases in short interest were seen throughout REITs (+6 basis points) and the Household and Personal Products (+8 basis points) sectors. Conversely, the largest declines were in the Financial Services (-15 basis points) and the Automobile (-9 basis points) sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeavily Shorted Stocks Might Not Always Be in Distress, Says S3 Partners\n\nS3 Partners revealed that there is a relatively weak correlation between short positions in certain assets and distress measures. This means that not all heavily shorted stocks are facing difficulties. As per the firm, broader market sentiments and valuation concerns are some of the factors that can drive short interest.\n\nThe company believes that shorting an asset can form part of broader strategies or hedging activities not linked to distress. It mentioned that there can be 3 measures of bearishness for stocks —- average analyst ratings (From 1 to 5), Credit default swap (CDS) spreads, and Altman Z-Score.\n\nFor example, the US Dollar had a low short position of ~1.32%. However, it had a high CDS spread of 1000 basis points. This indicates high perceived distress on the currency even though there is minimal short interest. This can be because of factors such as currency market dynamics or investor sentiments.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding (August 15, 2024): 0.80%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs a variety of consumer electronic devices, including smartphones (iPhone), tablets (iPad), PCs (Mac), smartwatches (Apple Watch), AirPods, and TV boxes (Apple TV), among others.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s long-term outlook is supported by its competitive advantages, which include high customer switching costs, intangible assets, and network effects around its iOS ecosystem. The company provides an expansive ecosystem of tightly integrated hardware, software, and services, which locks up the customers. Ultimately, this helps in generating strong profitability. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s move to in-house chip development accelerated its product development and increased differentiation.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that a higher mix of premium products, such as iPhone Pro models, should help improve product gross margins moving forward. Regarding AI, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is all prepared to make a massive push to the industry, given its release of iPhone 16 and the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a generative overhaul of the operating systems. Apple Intelligence is an exciting development and Apple is on the cusp of an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nThis new AI platform is expected to bring generative features throughout the company’s product lineup. These include a major upgrade to Siri, image, and language generation tools. Therefore, the company’s interconnected ecosystem should continue to act as a tailwind.\n\nIn 3Q 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) released 3Q 2024 financial results, with revenues reaching $85.8 billion, up 5% YoY, and earnings per diluted share touching $1.40, up 11% YoY.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) from $265.00 to $275.00, giving it a “Buy” rating on 2nd August.\n\nMar Vista Investment Partners, LLC, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of 10 Best Big-Name Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Short Sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Discounts: Buy These 3 Stocks (META, AAPL, NVDA)",
        "content": "Action over the last three months in the stock market has been marked by a notable shift in leaders from Tech and AI to more defensive sectors like Utilities, Healthcare, Real Estate and Bonds. In the chart below we can see that since June, the Real Estate ETF XLRE, Treasury ETF TLT, Utilities ETF XLU and Healthcare XLV have outperformed both SPY and QQQ by a fairly significant margin.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve signals the start of a rate-cutting regime and broad economic indicators (employment, growth, inflation) point to a slowdown (not a recession), it's not surprising that some investors have shifted to more conservative holdings.\n\nHowever, now that tech stocks have been out of favor for nearly three months, many of the leading names, such as the Magnificent Seven stocks have traded to quite attractive levels. In this article, I’ll highlight my top three picks moving forward—Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA)—along with key tactical trading levels to watch. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple: New iPhone and AI Innovations\n\nOn Monday, Apple unveiled a new lineup of products, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Key features of the iPhone 16 series include enhanced camera capabilities, improved battery life, a new Action button for quick shortcuts and its new AI system called Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 boasts upgraded health tracking features and a redesigned case. AirPods 4 offer improved audio quality, active noise cancellation, and enhanced hearing health features.\n\nApple has expanded its foray into health monitoring, with the AirPods now administering hearing tests and functioning as a 'clinical-grade' hearing aid. Additionally, the Apple Watch will now be able to monitor for sleep apnea by tracking breathing disturbances.\n\nAlthough critics often note the seemingly incremental improvements to these new Apple products, I find the health-monitoring functionalities especially compelling, while the new AI features could significantly improve usability.\n\nApple stock has notably outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks since May of this year, which is especially impressive considering the high volatility the market has experienced over the last three months. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAlong with the relative strength of Apple stock, a more granular look at the price action shows a potential bull flag forming. If the broad market can hold up and AAPL breaks out above the $220 level, it should make an attempt at new all-time highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the material integration of AI into the iPhone, the most widely used mobile device in the world sets up Apple to possibly ascend to AI leadership. At the least, if the AI narrative picks up again, Apple should be at the forefront. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMeta Platforms: A Well Rounded and Promising Stock Pick\n\nAlthough Meta Platforms seems to semi-regularly get caught up in frenzied controversy such as political scandals and misguided investments (Metaverse) the business continues to grow like crazy and spew profits. These manic cycles, although sometimes exhausting, have created numerous opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares at a discount.\n\nSales are expected to grow 19.8% this year and 13.9% next year, while earnings are projected to jump 43.6% this year and 12.7% next year. Analysts forecast earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years. Additionally, the stock is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.6x, which is inline with the market average and below its 10-year median valuation of 25x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms isn’t currently mixed up in any scandals and has rather been the second-best performing stock in the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023, bested only by Nvidia. But even with this incredible stock price appreciation, META remains among the cheapest of the group when comparing relative valuations thanks to equally impressive growth in EPS. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action in Meta Platforms’ stock also paints a bullish picture. In addition to relative strength, META is building out a bull flag, nest within a broader consolidation. If the stock can break out above the $515 level, it should move into the upper range and beyond. Alternatively, if the stock loses the lower bound support of ~$465, the broader market is likely selling off, and it may be prudent to wait for another opportunity. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nNvidia: Cheapest Relative Valuation in Years\n\nNvidia, the most exciting stock in the market over the last two years, has been struggling over the last three months. Between mid-June and early-August Nvidia staged a nasty correction, falling 35%. After rallying aggressively from the lows and testing the upper bound of the range, the shares have again sold off.\n\nHovering now just above $100, I think investors have an opportunity to buy the stock near the bottom of the range. And not only has the stock come down to more reasonable levels, so has the Semiconductor manufacturer’s valuation. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 38x, which is below its 10-year media of 42.8x and close to the lowest it has been in the last five years. With EPS forecast to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.9, which is a discount based on the metric.\n\nIf we look a little further into the future, Nvidia is trading at just 28x FY26 earnings. If growth remains as high as projected, Nvidia stock should continue to appreciate strongly.\n\nShould Investors Buy Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Apple Stock?\n\nGiven the current market conditions, a shift towards defensive sectors has created attractive buying opportunities among the tech leaders, particularly the Magnificent Seven. Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all experienced pullbacks in recent months, presenting investors with entry points at more reasonable valuations.\n\nApple, with its latest product releases and AI innovations, continues to show resilience and leadership, while Meta Platforms, despite past controversies, is experiencing tremendous growth and remains undervalued compared to its peers. Nvidia, despite its recent correction, offers high growth potential and is trading at its most attractive valuation in years.\n\nFor long-term investors, these stocks offer a blend of stability, innovation, and growth. Apple’s steady outperformance, Meta’s explosive earnings growth, and Nvidia’s dominance in AI and semiconductor technology make these three companies well-positioned for the next market uptrend. With their recent pullbacks, now may be the time to capitalize on their future potential before the market shifts back in favor of tech.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality Lab’s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\n\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for META\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jul 2020 Desjardins Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Apple believes Apple Intelligence is its platform of the future. Rolling it out will take time.",
        "content": "Apple’s iPhone 16 line hits store shelves on Sept. 20, and while the new phones get some impressive hardware upgrades, their biggest selling point isn’t the Pros’ larger displays or the lineup’s Camera Control button. It’s the generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence software platform.\n\nAnd while Apple Intelligence won’t launch alongside the new phones — it’ll begin to roll out as a software update for US English users in October — it’s clear that Apple (AAPL) is throwing all of its weight behind the technology as the catalyst to reaccelerate iPhone sales, which have flagged in recent quarters.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook pointed to the iPhone 16 lineup as the first built “from the ground up” for Apple Intelligence. Wall Street is similarly banking on Apple Intelligence pushing users to upgrade from their older iPhones, with analysts including Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring and Wedbush’s Dan Ives saying the platform is key to future iPhone growth.\n\nWhile the iPhone 16 may benefit from the inclusion of Apple Intelligence, the company is clearly positioning the platform as its software of the future, something it will build on for years to come.\n\n“This is a long-term play for Apple,” Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, wrote in a note following Apple’s iPhone 16 launch event on Sept. 9. “And while we may not see the bigger impact immediately, Apple Intelligence will eventually change the smartphone user experience completely, like with the first iPhone.” Apple debuted its generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence software platform on Monday, Sept. 9. (Apple)\n\nA slow roll\n\nDuring the show’s keynote, Apple hit on a number of Apple Intelligence features it says will be coming to iPhones next month. Those include product updates the company showed off during its WWDC event in June, such as generative AI-powered summarizations for text notifications and emails; writing tools to help proofread, punch up, and summarize documents; photo editing; and the ability to record and transcribe notes and phone calls.\n\nIt’s an early look at how Apple is thinking of AI and where it thinks it will benefit consumers the most. We’ve seen similar capabilities from Google and Samsung, but Apple was sure to point out that its first crop of AI offerings are just the beginning of a larger rollout, which will include a reimagined, more capable version of Siri.\n\nThe goal is to ensure consumers don’t get their hands on the first few AI apps and shrug their shoulders at their limited functionality. After all, the tech industry has promised that generative AI will revolutionize virtually every gadget and piece of software. And if consumers’ first experiences with the technology underwhelms, it could sour their view on Apple’s AI plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter all, remember what happened when Apple released its Apple Maps app in 2012 before it was ready for prime time? Users derided its look, and it took years for the software to gain traction.\n\nPositioning Apple Intelligence’s initial set of features as the first in a series of software updates for iPhone owners gives Apple the latitude to deliver portions of its AI platform piecemeal, ensuring that even if users are put off by early interactions with the software, the company will be able to correct those issues and have more capabilities to market in the future.\n\nLaunching new features in the future would also give Apple cover if any of the first batch of Apple Intelligence offerings run into hiccups like the kind Google experienced when it rolled out AI Overviews and had to pull it back after it told people to add glue to their pizza.\n\nOutside of that, slowly launching Apple Intelligence products should keep users from feeling overwhelmed with so many new features at once, which could similarly confuse and turn them off from the experience.\n\nApple still has to deliver\n\nWhile launching Apple Intelligence over time will help Apple better control its rollout, the company still has to deliver on its already lofty expectations. And while it may not blow people away at the start, the company is setting up Apple Intelligence to be quite an impressive collection of features.\n\nSiri, in particular, looks like it will finally become the smart assistant we were promised years ago, complete with the ability to understand what’s on your screen and the option to not only speak your requests but type them out as well.\n\n“I don’t think Siri is a new interface that will change how we interact with the world around us — yet,” Forrester VP and principal analyst Thomas Husson said in a statement. “However, there are clear signs that Siri is finally moving into becoming more of a digital agent leveraging on-device information and personal context to deliver new multimodal experiences and take actions on the user’s behalf.\"\n\nApple also showed off its new visual intelligence feature, which it says will use the iPhone 16’s new Camera Control functionality to provide information about the world around you similar to Google’s Circle to Search.

        "content": "Apple’s introduction of its iPhone 16 with integrated artificial intelligence (AI) marks the tech giant’s deeper foray into the AI race, a move that UBS says sees as the ongoing structural support for the AI trend and the increasing competition within the sector.\n\n“Without taking a view on individual companies, Apple’s foray into the AI race through its consumer AI services illustrates both ongoing structural support for the AI trend and the sector's increasingly competitive landscape,” UBS said.\n\nWhile the product launch may not have significantly spiked Apple’s stock, UBS analysts view it as a signal of the broader, longer-term growth in AI-related capital expenditures across big tech companies.\n\nUBS analysts noted that the strong capital spending on AI will continue, particularly as companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramp up their investments in AI-enabled devices and services. “We expect big tech’s capex on AI to grow 47% this year to USD 218 billion, and by another 16.5% in 2025 to USD 254 billion,” the firm noted.\n\nThe iPhone 16’s A18 chip, designed specifically to support generative AI, represents Apple’s latest bid to improve AI functionality while maintaining its privacy-focused approach. UBS sees this as part of a broader trend, with AI compute demand projected to grow strongly.\n\n“New AI models could require 10-20 times more compute than current ones,” UBS said, pointing towards the increasing investment in graphics processing units (GPUs) and other AI infrastructure for growth prospects.\n\nMoreover, UBS remains optimistic about the sector’s fundamentals. \"Recent declines have been driven by broader economic uncertainty rather than weakening AI fundamentals,\" UBS stated.\n\nThe firm expects big tech’s earnings to grow near 15-20% over the next few quarters on the back of increasing AI monetization efforts. “We forecast big tech’s combined free cash flows to rise from $413 billion this year to USD 522 billion in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple’s AI push reinforces strong spending trends in tech: UBS\n\nInstant view: Fed's Barr unveils sweeping bank capital plan revisions after pushback, delays\n\nEarnings call: Bioceres reports record FY2024 revenues despite crop price drop\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- DA Davidson analysts initiated Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 per share price target in a note Tuesday, saying it is facing challenges in its core Search business, and its future growth may depend on other parts of its portfolio.\n\nHowever, the firm sees Alphabet's positioning in these areas as mixed, leading them to expect the stock to continue trading at a discount compared to other mega-cap companies.\n\nThe analysts highlight that Alphabet is at a critical point in its evolution, stating that it \"will either be 'Xeroxed' or emerge as a leader in the most important new categories of Compute.\"\n\nThey draw a parallel between Google's current situation and Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) in the 1980s, which invented much of the technology behind the PC but watched companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) capitalize on it.\n\nDA Davidson expresses concern over Google's slower response to the introduction of AI services, particularly with Microsoft's rapid commercialization of AI over the past 18 months.\n\nWhile they believe Alphabet has shown some encouraging signs, such as the reacceleration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its potential to achieve AI product parity, DA Davidson points out that Google has made notable missteps.\n\nOne example is the under-commercialization of Google TPUs, a viable alternative to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, which have missed capturing much of the $3 trillion hardware market.\n\nShorter-term, Google faces the challenge of transitioning from a 90% market share in Search to something less, as AI-enhanced search tools gain prominence. Coupled with the Department of Justice charges that may limit its monopoly, Google's path forward looks uncertain, according to the firm.\n\nDA Davidson concludes that without more aggressive strategies, Google's stock will likely continue to trade at a discount.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle shares to continue to trade at a discount to other mega-caps - DA Davidson\n\nSweden stocks lower at close of trade; OMX Stockholm 30 down 0.62%\n\nSpain stocks lower at close of trade; IBEX 35 down 0.61%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ireland to Decide How to Use Apple’s €13 Billion It Didn’t Want",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Ireland just landed a challenge most countries would envy: how to spend an almost €13.8 billion ($15.2 billion) windfall that Apple Inc. was ordered to pay in taxes by the European Union’s top court.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nIronically, the Irish government has always maintained that it didn’t think Apple owed these taxes. But the EU’s Court of Justice Tuesday backed a landmark 2016 decision that Ireland broke state-aid laws by giving the company tax benefits that resulted in an unfair advantage.\n\nThe money involved has been sitting in escrow since an initial EU court ruling in 2016, and the bloc’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said in a news conference that the taxes “must be released to the Irish state.”\n\nThe Irish finance ministry said in a statement that it “respects the findings” even as it continued to insist that “Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies or taxpayers.” It added that the process of transferring the assets from the escrow fund will now commence.\n\n“It is a complex process which is expected to take a number of months to conclude,” Irish Finance Minister Jack Chambers told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “It is a one-off payment and we will have discussions with party leaders on what next steps will be.”\n\nThe funds have been accruing interest since it was paid by Apple into an escrow account. The Irish government said in July the total value of the fund stands at €13.8 billion, after generating €400 million in 2023. The total represents about 15% of the upcoming government budget.\n\nThe sudden cash bonanza comes as Irish politicians are expecting the government to call an election in the coming months, adding an extra charge to the debate on how to use it.\n\nOpposition parties are already calling for a parliamentary debate on how to use the money, with criticism that the government had defended corporate interests, and not the public’s.\n\n“Everybody’s going to be demanding everything, and it’s going to be very hard for the government to say no when they want to basically get back into power,” said Aidan Regan, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University College Dublin.\n\nThe country faces a housing crisis and a record number of people are homeless with a lack of supply and house prices out of reach of most. Ivana Bacik, the leader of the Labour Party, said in a post on X that the proceeds of the case could “be used to underpin a dedicated long-term housing fund.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the spending in the budget for 2025, which will be announced Oct. 1 has already been decided, said Chambers. “This will not impact on the parameters already set out for Budget 2025,” he told reporters.\n\nRare Surplus\n\nDublin is in the enviable position of having one of Europe’s rare budget surpluses, thanks to the presence of all those multinational companies. In September, the government reported a significant increase in corporation tax receipts, and officials are working to set up a sovereign wealth fund that the finance ministry estimates could eventually reach €100 billion.\n\nEven with such healthy public finances, €13.8 billion is still a “huge amount of money for a small country,” said Regan.\n\nThere were concerns in Dublin that the case — and subsequent appeal — would create uncertainty around tax affairs in Ireland, where low rates had long been a draw. The country has remained an attractive hub for the tech and pharmaceutical industries, with many of the world’s largest companies, including Meta Platforms Inc, Alphabet Inc. and Pfizer Inc., maintaining large physical presences.\n\nApple was one of the first tech giants to set up in Ireland, as a result of its deliberately low corporate tax rate in the 1980s and early 1990s to attract foreign investment. The company set up its European headquarters outside the southern city of Cork in 1980, and now employs around 6,000 in Ireland.\n\n--With assistance from Samuel Stolton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Pandemic-Fueled ‘Dating Recession’ Is Reshaping American Economy ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

With its latest results, the supplier of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) showed positive revenue growth and perhaps more importantly, proved that the transformation of the acquired VMware around private cloud is well grounded.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on August 4th, Broadcom reported revenue grew 47% YoY to $13.07 billion, surpassing FactSet’s and LSEG’s consensus estimate of $12.98 billion. When excluding the contributions from VMware deal that closed in November, revenue only grew 4%. Semiconductor solutions brought in $7.27 billion with revenue growing 5% YoY, but still short of FactSet’s estimate of $7.42 billion. Strengthened by the VMware deal, infrastructure-solutions reported revenue grew as much as 200%, topping FactSet’s consensus estimate of $5.52 billion.\n\nBut, Broadcom ended up with a net loss of $1.88 billion, or 40 cents a share.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to $1.24, surpassing LSEG’s consensus estimate of $1.20.\n\nGuidance in line with expectations.\n\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom guided for revenue of $14 billion.\n\nFueled by ethernet networking and custom accelerators for AI data centers, Broadcom lifted its prior forecast as it now expects $12 billion in full-year AI revenue from sold AI parts and custom chips. It previously expected $11 billion. For the full year, Broadcom expects adjusted EBITDA to be 64% of revenue.\n\nBroadcom's contribution is not going unnoticed.\n\nOver the past year, Broadcom stock rose as much as 75%, underlying the fact that the market is seeing the company as a noteworthy contributor to the AI infrastructure in the making. Some example of Broadcom’s work is on the Google-made TPU chip, the custom chip that even Apple used in its AI training work. With this decision, Apple also showed its focus to reduce reliance on the dominating chip player, Nvidia, as when it comes to AI training, Nivida makes the rules with its graphics processing units. Unsurprisingly, Nvidia put a hefty price tag on these highly wanted chips that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Open AI and Anthropic use for their current models, while Google is among those using them to make its AI offerings and build its system. Therefore, the Apple supplier seems to have a less-obvious but still noteworthy role in the AI dynamics and new era that is in the making and Broadcom is clearly somewhat receiving the acknowledgement for its contribution.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Blackwell chip delay is center stage amid stock slump",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nervous Nvidia Corp. investors are eager for an update on its Blackwell chip rollout — hoping for a catalyst to halt the stock’s recent decline.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nThe next-generation processor was unveiled six months ago, but has faced engineering snags that delayed its release. While Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang tried to reassure the market last month that revenue from the chip is coming soon, some investors were left wanting for details. That — along with broader macroeconomic jitters — has contributed to a 15% selloff since the earnings report.\n\nLingering questions about Blackwell will be a key focus when Huang speaks at a Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. He’s scheduled to speak with David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive officer, at 7:20 a.m. local time.\n\n“Nobody likes a delay,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc. “It’s one of those blips that investors are just kind of latching onto.” In the absence of other positive catalysts for the stock — and combined with broader worries hitting the whole tech sector — the Blackwell snags have added to concerns that the artificial intelligence darling has risen too far, too fast.\n\nWhile Nvidia has done a good job of managing expectations, “they probably could communicate better, particularly around the Blackwell issue,” Mulberry added.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Bank of America analysts, who wrote in a research report last week that details about the readiness of Blackwell shipments are the key fundamental catalyst for a recovery in Nvidia shares.\n\nBlackwell is the next generation of the company’s dominant AI processor and has been eagerly awaited by investors to provide the next leg of growth. Nvidia acknowledged in its latest earnings report that there were issues with production and said it has had to revamp part of the chip’s manufacturing process.\n\nStill, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue from Blackwell in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends January 31. The production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026, according to comments on the earnings call.\n\nIf everything goes smoothly and Nvidia is able to deliver its Blackwell chips on this schedule, then the stock may become less volatile than in recent months, Mulberry said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ve said they’ll be able to bring things up to speed by early 2025, and “if they can communicate clearly that they are still on track to do that and there won’t be any further delays in production, they can quell some of these short-term fears,” he said.\n\nStill, if Blackwell faces more delays or snags, that could add to downside pressure on the shares — especially with few other catalysts on the horizon and potential risks related to a US Justice Department antitrust probe.\n\nRandy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington National Bank, agrees that near-term pressure on Nvidia shares is likely to the downside. Still, for investors who believe in the potential of AI in the long-term, it could be a good time to add to positions.\n\n“We’re maybe part-way through the mid-cycle correction,” said Hare. “And then I think you’ll get a good opportunity where people will realize that this is the best growth area in the market and they’ll start putting money to work again.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc. lost its court fight over a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) Irish tax bill, in a boost to the European Union’s crackdown on special deals doled out by nations to big companies. Google lost its bid to topple a once-record €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) European Union fine for abusing its monopoly power to crush rival shopping services. Apple introduced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that’s still on the horizon. Huawei Technologies Co. announced the world’s first commercial device with two folds, claiming leadership in mobile design just after Apple Inc. unveiled its latest iPhones. SpaceX launched a rocket carrying four private astronauts to space, part of a groundbreaking mission aimed at performing the world’s first commercial space walk.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing Your First $10,000 In ETFs, Redditors Share Their Tips For Beginning Investors\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFor young investors, getting started can be exciting but also nerve-wracking. One 25-year-old investor posted in the r/dividends subreddit to get advice on investing $10,000. The investor was looking for ideas for low to medium-risk high-yield exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and plans to add $250 to $500 monthly.\n\nRedditors chimed in with various ETFs and guidance for the beginning investor, including ensuring they have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before starting. Many cautioned the young investor not to dive in with all $10,000 into one option but to slowly begin building up positions. Dollar-cost averaging is a way to build up positions over time, thereby reducing the risk of buying all at once at an unfavorable price.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nSome suggested using limit orders to help narrow down buying prices. High-yield ETFs do not always have high returns, and some cautioned the young investor to consider both. Others said that one potential strategy is to max out a Roth IRA before investing through a taxable account.\n\nSPLG: A Low-Cost Index Option\n\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPLG) seeks to match the total return performance of the S&P 500 Index. Redditors praised the fund’s lower expense ratio. SPLG is a low-cost ETF that seeks to offer comprehensive exposure to the large-cap part of the market. It has met the benchmark of the index it tracks for ten years. Major holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nDGRO: Tracking Consistently Growing Dividends\n\nStarted in 2014, the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE:DGRO) is designed to offer exposure to companies that provide consistent dividend growth with a low expense ratio. It tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, and since its inception, it has delivered an 11.27% total return, roughly in line with its benchmark. Top holdings are blue-chip companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Apple Inc.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast — No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade. The total net worth of these five entrepreneurs is $223 billion – they all believe in one company where you can lend money to companies at 7-9% APY.\n\n$100K In VOO?\n\nOne Redditor shared the experience of achieving the enviable goal of $100,000 by first investing in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO). This fund invests in stocks in the S&P 500 Index and tracks the index's return. This fund offers the potential for high investment growth but may have downturns along with the market it tracks. It is often suitable for long-term investors seeking growth rather than dividends. “After that first 100K, I started thinking about building an income portfolio and did a lot of research from there. I still have that 100K in VOO, never sold, and it’s worth a lot more than 100K now. I’m just focusing on dividend funds at this time,\" said the Redditor.\n\nSPYI: An Active Approach\n\nThe NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is an actively managed fund created in 2022. It distributes high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy. Because the fund is actively managed, it has a higher expense ratio and seeks to exploit tax loss harvesting opportunities. It has generated 25.9% in total returns since inception.\n\nThe young investor has the most essential asset available for anyone hoping to make big returns in the stock market: time. As Warren Buffett famously said, \"The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.\"\n\nA 9% Return In Just 3 Months\n\nEquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets. This short-term note investment offers investors a 9% rate of return (APY) with just a 3 month term and $5K minimum. The Basecamp rate is at a significant spread to t-bills. This healthy rate of return won't last long. With the Fed poised to cut interest rates in the near future, now could be the time to lock in a favorable rate of return with a flexible, relatively liquid investment option.\n\nWhat's more, Alpine Note — Basecamp can be rolled into another Alpine Note for compounding returns, or into another of EquityMultiple's rigorously vetted real estate investments, which also carry a minimum investment of just $5K. Basecamp is exclusively open to new investors on the EquityMultiple platform.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

        "title": "Apple, Google Lose Multibillion Dollar Court Fights With EU",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. lost its court fight over a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) Irish tax bill, in a boost to the European Union’s crackdown on special deals doled out by nations to big companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nThe EU’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg backed a landmark 2016 decision that Ireland broke state-aid law by giving the iPhone maker an unfair advantage.\n\nThe court ruled on Tuesday that a lower court win for Apple should be overturned, because judges incorrectly decided that the commission’s regulators had made mistakes in their assessment.\n\nThe ruling is a boost for EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, whose mandate in Brussels is about to end after two terms.\n\nIn 2016, Vestager sparked outrage across the Atlantic when she homed in on Apple’s tax arrangements. She claimed that Ireland granted illegal benefits to the Cupertino, California-based company that enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses in the country, over many years.\n\nShe ordered Ireland to claw back the €13 billion sum, which amounts to about two quarters of Mac sales globally. The money has been sitting in an escrow account pending a final ruling.\n\n“We are disappointed with today’s decision as previously the general court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case,” an Apple spokesperson said.\n\nAt 4:16 a.m. New York time, Apple shares were down 1.3% at $218 in premarket trading on Tuesday.\n\nWhile it is a negative outcome for Ireland, which had claimed it had not given any tax advantages to Apple or other tech companies to set up there, given how long the case took to reach completion, it is now unlikely to have much of an impact for the country that is a well established hub for the European headquarters of a large number of major tech companies.\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook previously blasted the EU move as “total political crap.” The U.S. Treasury has also weighed in, saying that the EU was making itself a “supra-national tax authority” that could threaten global tax reform efforts. Then President Donald Trump said Vestager “hates the United States” because “she’s suing all our companies.”\n\nThe Apple decision was by far the biggest in Vestager’s decade-long campaign for tax fairness, which has also targeted the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and carmaker Stellantis NV’s Fiat. Vestager has argued that selective tax benefits to big firms are illegal state aid that are banned in the EU.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt issue in Tuesday’s case were two tax deals with the Irish government in 1991 and 2007. Those agreements allowed Apple to mis-attribute Irish profits to a “head office” that “only existed on paper,” according to the EU’s assessment. In turn, this resulted in a massive reduction in tax bills. The EU’s antitrust arm argued the break Apple received was anti-competitive, amounting to illegal state aid.\n\nThe case landed at the EU’s top court after Vestager contested Apple’s win at a lower tribunal in 2020. Judges at the bloc’s General Court found EU state aid watchdogs made several errors.\n\nSince then, the Dane has suffered several more tax defeats but she took comfort from the fact that judges backed her approach to using state-aid rules to attack unfair arrangements.\n\nApple was one of the first US tech giants to set up in Ireland, as a result of its deliberately low corporate tax rate in the 1980s and early 1990s, designed to attract foreign investment. The company set up its European headquarters outside the southern city of Cork in 1980 and now employs around 6,000 in the country.\n\nIn the years since, many tax loopholes once available have been closed and Ireland in 2021 signed up OECD measures that include a global minimum rate of 15% for multinational corporations.\n\n--With assistance from Gian Volpicelli, Saim Saeed and Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates with shares in the eighth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The decision is a boost for Europe’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, who is overseeing a tax crackdown on US multinationals - AP Photo/Virginia Mayo\n\nApple has been ordered to pay €13bn (£11bn) to Ireland after losing a decade-long fight with the European Union over “sweetheart” tax breaks.\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled on Tuesday that Apple had benefited from years of illegal state aid by receiving unfair tax support from the Irish government.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, Europe’s competition chief, had ordered the company to pay Ireland the fee in 2016 after a two-year investigation. However, the ruling had been overturned by a lower EU court in 2020 after Apple appealed the case.\n\nThe CJEU is the EU’s highest court, meaning the decision cannot be appealed and the funds will now have to be released to the Irish government. They have been frozen in an escrow account since 2018.\n\nThe decision is a boost for Ms Vestager’s tax crackdown on US multinationals after she was previously defeated in a separate case involving Amazon before the CJEU.\n\nIn its latest ruling, the CJEU said: “On appeal, the Court of Justice sets aside the judgment of the General Court and gives final judgment in the matter, conversely confirming the Commission’s decision.”\n\nIn 2016, Ms Vestager said the Irish tax authority had allowed Apple to benefit from tax rates as low as 0.005pc since 1991, meaning it underpaid billions of euros in taxes.\n\nTim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, had called the original ruling “total political crap”. Apple chief Tim Cook branded the EU's original ruling 'total political crap' - NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe company says it has now paid $20bn (£15bn) in taxes on the relevant profits in the US.\n\nAn Apple spokesman said: “This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.\n\n“Apple is proud to be an engine of growth and innovation across Europe and around the world, and to consistently be one of the largest taxpayers in the world. The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US.\n\n“We are disappointed with today’s decision as previously the General Court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case.”\n\nIn a separate case on Tuesday, the CJEU upheld a €2.4bn fine for Google first ordered in 2017 after the EU found that it had abused its search dominance to boost its shopping service.",

        "content": "Investing in fundamentally strong growth companies with sustainable competitive advantages can be a smart long-term strategy for astute investors. With artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a major investment trend, it is no surprise that billionaires have also been actively pursuing high-quality AI-powered stocks.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) seem to fit the bill and have been picked up by multiple billionaire investors and investment funds. Here's why retail investors should also follow their path and consider taking at least a small position in these stocks now.\n\nBroadcom\n\nSemiconductor chip designer and enterprise software player Broadcom's shares are up 25% in 2024. While a 10-for-1 stock split in July 2024 played a major role in improving investor sentiment, many billionaire investors identified the growth potential in this stock in the second quarter of 2024. Some prominent ones were Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors, the late Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, Israel Englander's Millennium Management, Jerome Dodson's Parnassus Investments Holdings, and DE Shaw's David Shaw.\n\nThe increasing adoption of complex AI technologies has emerged as one of Broadcom's most prominent growth catalysts. Broadcom accounts for nearly 80% share of the data center networking chips market. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), the company's networking segment revenue soared 43% year over year to $4 billion. The solid performance was driven by robust demand from hyperscalers for the company's AI-optimized networking solutions and custom AI accelerators.\n\nIn the third quarter, sales of Ethernet switching products such as Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI were up more than fourfold year over year. Sales of custom AI accelerators, which can be more efficient for specific activities instead of general-purpose GPUs, were up 3.5 times year over year in the third quarter. The AI accelerator business is very profitable and scalable and has high barriers to entry. Subsequently, the company has raised its fiscal 2024 AI revenue projection from $11 billion to $12 billion.\n\nThe acquisition of virtualization software technology player VMware has also strengthened Broadcom's enterprise software portfolio and reduced its reliance on hardware sales. VMware contributed $3.8 billion in sales in the third quarter. The company expects the high-margin VMware business to enable the company to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin of almost 64% by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom's share price tumbled nearly 10% in late-morning trading on Sept. 6, the day after it released third-quarter results. Although the company surpassed analyst revenue and earnings estimates, a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter forecast seems to have adversely affected investor sentiment. However, this reaction seems overdone for a stock like Broadcom with solid fundamentals and robust growth prospects, and will most likely be short-lived.\n\nConsidering the many pros and the current dip in share prices, Broadcom seems like a great stock to buy in September 2024.\n\nApple\n\nAlthough Warren Buffett's investment company Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake in technology titan Apple by nearly 50% in the second quarter of 2024, many other billionaire investors have been piling on this stock. A few of the prominent ones are Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, Englander's Millennium Management, Jeremy Grantham's Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, Griffin's Citadel Advisors, Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors, and Sander Gerber's Hudson Bay Capital.\n\nApple posted impressive results for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 (ended June 29), with revenue and earnings surpassing analysts' average estimates. The company's ecosystem of products and services saw robust demand despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures.\n\nHistorically, the iPhone has been the major growth catalyst for Apple. Although iPhone sales were down 1% year over year to $39.3 billion in the third quarter, a recent Kantar survey showed iPhone models to be the top-selling smartphone in many key markets, such as the U.S., urban China, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and Japan.\n\nApple recently launched the generative AI technology Apple Intelligence, which will be integrated into its entire product line. The company expects Apple Intelligence to drive more customers to upgrade to newer iPhones capable of running these AI services. The company is gearing up to launch the iOS 18 operating system to make the iPhone more personalized, intelligent, and capable. Coupled with the iPhone's installed base reaching a new all-time high at the end of the third quarter, the iPhone upgrade cycle can be a major catalyst for Apple in the coming years.\n\nApple's digital services segment also reported an all-time revenue high of $24.2 billion, up 14% on a year-over-year basis. The services business is critical in securing recurring revenue streams and building a steady customer base. Services are seeing rising customer demand, thanks to the company's huge installed base of devices. Apple ended the third quarter with more than 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services segment, more than double four years ago. With the highly profitable services business becoming a bigger part of Apple's business, the company's margins are well positioned to widen in future quarters.\n\nApple is trading at trailing-12-month price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 8.64 times, significantly higher than its five-year average (P/S) of 6.92 times. Despite the elevated valuation, the stock seems attractively priced when compared with the majority of the other AI-powered technology titans.\n\nIt may make sense for investors to piggyback on several of the billionaires' investment analyses and consider picking up at least a small stake in this stock now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "29.5% of Warren Buffett's $305.7 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has been at the helm of the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company since 1965. During his 59 years of leadership, Berkshire Hathaway stock has delivered a compound annual return of 19.8%, which would have been enough to turn an investment of $1,000 back then into more than $42.5 million today.\n\nBuffett's investment strategy is simple. He looks for growing companies with robust profitability and strong management teams, and he especially likes those with shareholder-friendly programs like dividend payments and stock-buyback plans.\n\nOne thing Buffett doesn't focus on is the latest stock market trend, so you won't find him piling money into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks right now. However, two stocks Berkshire already holds are becoming significant players in the AI industry, and they account for about 29.5% of the total value of the conglomerate's $305.7 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: 28.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company with a $3.3 trillion market capitalization, but it was worth a fraction of that when Buffett started buying the stock in 2016. Between then and 2023, Berkshire spent about $38 billion building its stake in Apple, and thanks to a staggering return, that position had a value of more than $170 billion earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Berkshire has sold more than half of its stake in the iPhone maker during the past few months. Its remaining position is still worth $88.3 billion, so it's still the largest holding in the conglomerate's portfolio, and I think the recent sales reflect Buffett's cautious view on the broader market as opposed to Apple itself. After all, the S&P 500 is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27.6 right now, which is significantly more expensive than its average of 18.1 going back to the 1950s.\n\nBesides, Apple is preparing for one of the most important periods in its history. With more than 2.2 billion active devices globally -- including iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers -- Apple could become the world's biggest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nThe company unveiled Apple Intelligence earlier this year, which it developed in partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It's embedded in the new iOS 18 operating system, and it will only be available on the latest iPhone 16 and the previous iPhone 15 Pro models because they are fitted with next-generation chips designed to process AI workloads.\n\nConsidering Apple Intelligence is going to transform many of the company's existing software applications, it could drive a big upgrade cycle for the iPhone. Apps like Notes, Mail, and iMessage will feature new writing tools capable of instantly summarizing and generating text content on command. Plus, Apple's existing Siri voice assistant is going to be enhanced by ChatGPT, which will bolster its knowledge base and its capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Apple's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent quarters, the company still ticks nearly all of Buffett's boxes. It's highly profitable, it has an incredible management team led by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, and it's returning truckloads of money to shareholders through dividends and buybacks -- in fact, Apple recently launched a new $110 billion stock buyback program, which is the largest in corporate American history.\n\nThere is no guarantee Berkshire has finished selling Apple stock, but the rise of AI will likely drive a renewed phase of growth for the company, so that's a good reason to remain bullish no matter what Buffett does next.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought a relatively small stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2019, which is currently worth $1.7 billion and represents just 0.6% of the conglomerate's portfolio. However, Buffett has often expressed regret for not recognizing the opportunity much sooner, because Amazon has expanded beyond its roots as an e-commerce company and now has a dominant presence in streaming, digital advertising, and cloud computing.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest business-to-business cloud platform in the world, offering hundreds of solutions designed to help organizations operate in the digital era. But AWS also wants to be the go-to provider of AI solutions for businesses, which could be its largest financial opportunity ever.\n\nAWS developed its own data center chips like Trainium, which can offer cost savings of up to 50% compared to competing hardware from suppliers like Nvidia. Plus, the cloud provider also built a family of large language models (LLMs) called Titan, which developers can use if they don't want to create their own. They are accessible through Amazon Bedrock, along with a portfolio of third-party LLMs from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic. LLMs are at the foundation of every AI chat bot application.\n\nFinally, AWS now offers its own AI assistant called Q. Amazon Q Business can be trained on an organization's data so employees can instantly find answers to their queries, and it can also generate content to boost productivity. Amazon Q Developer, on the other hand, can debug and generate code to help accelerate the completion of software projects.\n\nAccording to consulting firm PwC, AI could add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and the combination of chips, LLMs, and software apps will help Amazon stake its claim to that enormous pie.\n\nAmazon was consistently losing money when Berkshire bought the stock, and it doesn't offer a dividend nor does it have a stock buyback program, so it doesn't tick many of Buffett's boxes (hence the small position). But it might be the most diverse AI stock investors can buy right now, and Berkshire will likely be pleased with its long-term return from here even if Buffett wishes it owned a bigger stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got a Grim Warning From Apple and Amazon",
        "content": "Semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\n\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\n\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\nApple's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\n\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\n\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\n\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple unveils AI-powered iPhone 16 range",
        "content": "Apple has unveiled the new iPhone 16 range – the company’s first devices powered by its new artificial intelligence tools it claims will have a “profound impact” on users.\n\nThe four new smartphones will go on sale on September 20 and come with Apple Intelligence built in, a set of tools which use generative AI to help users with every day administrative tasks as well as offer text and image editing capabilities – following similar tools already launched by rivals Google and Samsung on their flagship phones.\n\nThe design changes to the handsets themselves are incremental, but Apple has added a new Camera Control button to the phones, from which users will be able to instantly launch the camera app, take photos and videos or select different capturing tools and options.\n\nThe button can also be used to access another new AI-powered tool, called Visual Intelligence, which enables users to carry out image-based searches on places or objects by capturing an photo of them.\n\nSpeaking at the event to unveil the new devices, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said these were the first iPhones to be designed “from the ground up for Apple Intelligence” and that the new “personal intelligence system” would have a “profound impact” for users.\n\n“The innovation and invention these products deliver will continue to deepen the meaningful impact they have on all of our lives,” Mr Cook said.\n\n“I’m proud of our teams and what they’ve accomplished and I can’t wait for you to experience these amazing products.”\n\nApple Park is glowing! #AppleEventpic.twitter.com/gVgtMbZhaM\n\n— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 9, 2024\n\nThe AI-powered tools use “personal context” to provide help, Apple said, for example offering edits to writing or notes made in almost any app, or being able to quickly find a specific photo or moment within a video based on a typed description.\n\nThe tools can also be used to find specific emails, flight details and other personal information instantly, as well as offer email summaries and prioritise certain notifications and enable users to create their own emoji or new image.\n\nThe tech giant confirmed the new devices would go on sale on September 20, with Apple Intelligence tools rolling out in a software update, starting in October.\n\nApple confirmed the iPhone 16 would start at £799, with the iPhone 16 Plus starting at £899, while the iPhone 16 Pro will start at £999 and the iPhone 16 Pro Max starting at £1,199.\n\nStory continues\n\nBen Wood, smartphone expert and chief analyst at CCS Insight, said although Apple had not entirely shaken the perception that its phone launches were becoming more low-key, its new AI tools were still eye-catching.\n\n“There is a growing feeling that smartphone updates have become a bit boring. Apple is not immune to this trend and is betting on software and AI to breathe new life into its most important product to reignite consumer interest and drive upgrade purchases,” he said.\n\n“As expected, Apple Intelligence features will roll out progressively over the next few months and years. However, at present, a notable exclusion is the EU, where Apple is in a stand-off over compliance with the Digital Markets Act.\n\n“We will be watching closely to see how European consumers react to missing out on the new Apple Intelligence features and whether it affects demand for the iPhone 16.\n\n“We note with interest that Apple Intelligence will be available in the UK — which, since Brexit, falls outside the EU. Historically Apple has treated the region with a consistent approach since the UK’s departure from the trade bloc so this is a notable change.\n\n“Many of the features being offered by Apple Intelligence, such as summarising emails and editing photos, are similar to those previously showcased by Google and Samsung.\n\n“However, as it has done in the past, Apple put a heavy focus on privacy as a differentiator — this aligns well with CCS Insight’s research, which indicates that despite the enthusiasm for AI, about 43% of UK consumers surveyed expressed concerns about privacy and data security.” Apple Intelligence can help users rewrite any notes or emails in a range of styles. (Apple)\n\nFellow smartphone expert Ernest Doku, from Uswitch.com, agreed that the AI tools were the main notable change in an otherwise incremental iPhone update.\n\n“Last year’s iPhone launch left some a little disappointed by Apple’s strategy of ‘evolution not revolution’, and many feel that Android devices have pulled ahead in the last 12 months,” he said.\n\n“Apple’s latest launch may not have entirely changed this perception, but there are still some innovative features worth calling out on its new flagship smartphone. Although the new camera updates and Camera Control button are impressive, the biggest development is the new handsets’ Apple Intelligence compatibility.\n\n“This unique delivery of deep AI integration into every aspect of the phone ensures Apple’s refresh can keep pace with key features touted at recent releases of Google’s Pixel and Samsung’s Galaxy devices alike.\n\n“An exciting development is Apple’s focus on personal data security when it comes to using generative AI, with nothing shared with Apple while using Apple Intelligence. This could set its AI technology apart, as consumers continue to prioritise their digital privacy.”\n\nElsewhere, the technology giant unveiled the redesigned and update Apple Watch Series 10, which will include the ability to detect sleep apnea for the first time.\n\nIn addition, a software update to the firm’s existing AirPods Pro 2 will enable wearers to use them as a clinical-grade hearing aid.",

        "title": "Huawei unveils $2,800 trifold phone hours after iPhone 16 debut",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. announced the world’s first commercial device with two folds, claiming leadership in mobile design just after Apple Inc. unveiled its latest iPhones.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nThe so-called trifold phone from Huawei, dubbed the Mate XT and starting at 19,999 yuan ($2,800), took over five years of development and promises to fit a 10-inch tablet in a pocket. Introduced in a livestreamed event from Shenzhen, the new device is jostling for attention at the top of the premium market in China, where Huawei has reclaimed share from Apple over the past year.\n\nRiding a yearlong high after the debut of a breakthrough, made-in-China mobile processor last August, Huawei returns with a first-of-its-kind innovation. But questions abound as to how much of an impact the pricey new phone will have on the overall market. And, at a time that every other phone vendor is pushing artificial intelligence features and additions, Huawei’s focus on hardware engineering stands out.\n\n“It’ll be hard for trifold products to become a major growth engine for the foldable market given the high technical requirements, low yields, high prices and limited participants,” IDC analyst Arthur Guo said ahead of Huawei’s event. Other phone makers are starting to decelerate investment in foldables, waiting for Apple to enter the fray and use its “strong appeal” to attract consumers to the category, he added.\n\nFor Huawei, the prize may be bigger than just sales. Huawei has become a de facto symbol of national pride, after developing homemade chips that US trade sanctions were meant to prevent, and that patriotism has shown up in some of its bumper sales over the past year.\n\nThe Mate XT measures just 3.6mm in thickness when open — camera bump excluded — and was designed to allow three modes of operation. One is like a regular smartphone, another is an almost square foldable device, and the third is the full 10.2-inch tablet experience. The device runs Huawei’s in-house Harmony OS.\n\nThe company’s decision to set its trifold debut mere hours after Apple’s worldwide introduction of the iPhone 16 signals the company wants to own the innovation crown — at home in China, at least — and not allow Apple its usual honeymoon period after a new launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei and Apple are likely to once again dominate the Chinese premium smartphone tier this holiday shopping season, with the Shenzhen company expected to introduce a new Mate series of flagship handsets later in the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 33% last month, in a positive signal to investors betting on a smartphone market recovery and sustained demand for Nvidia Corp.’s AI chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nSales reached NT$250.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in August, slowing from the previous month’s 45% growth pace. For the third quarter, analysts expect TSMC’s revenue to grow 37%, extending a recovery from the post-Covid depths of 2023.\n\nWhile just a month’s snapshot, the results could assuage concerns about whether the market has over-estimated the durability of AI infrastructure spending. Nvidia’s shares shed some $279 billion on Sept. 3 in their biggest single-day loss of value, after reporting earnings that failed to live up to the loftiest expectations.\n\nTaiwan’s largest company now makes more than half of its revenue from high-performance computing, the segment of its business driven by AI demand.\n\nNvidia’s go-to chipmaker is also the main manufacturer for the iPhone’s main processor. Apple Inc. on Monday unveiled the iPhone 16, built for AI “from the ground up” but with capabilities that will be gradually added to the device via software updates. Wall Street is betting on a bounce-back in demand for mobile devices.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nApple’s adoption of Wi-Fi 7 on the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro should accelerate technology penetration and boost demand for TSMC’s N6 (7-nanometer) and N4 (5-nanometer) nodes already used by Broadcom and MediaTek and others for Wi-Fi 7 chip production. A18 and A18 Pro processor performance gains align with our expectations, reinforcing a positive outlook for TSMC’s N3E node sales growth.\n\n- Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nTSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings. In July, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.\n\nAs the market improves, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei is spearheading a major global expansion.\n\nThe company has flagged early progress in ramping up a project in Arizona, is considering a third fab in Japan, and broke ground a few weeks ago on a €10 billion German facility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple's new iPhone launch drew scorn on Tuesday for its lack of artificial intelligence features in China, a challenge for the U.S. giant as it battles growing competition from Huawei Technologies in the world's largest smartphone market.\n\nApple unveiled its long-awaited, AI-boosted iPhone 16 on Monday, hoping the new features would drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in its smartphone sales, which account for more than half of its total sales.\n\nBut Apple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power the 16s, and Apple Intelligence, the company's AI software, will be available in Chinese language only next year.\n\nThe iPhone 16 launch dominated discussions on Chinese social media on Tuesday, ahead of Huawei's unveiling of a three-way foldable smartphone later in the day.\n\nOn Weibo, China's X-like platform, three of the top 10 trending topics were related to the iPhone 16 launch, with AI features among a key topic of discussion.\n\nThe hashtag \"iPhone 16 Chinese version doesn't support AI yet\" attracted 11.33 million views and over 1,500 comments on Weibo.\n\n\"What's the point of buying it if you can't use AI?\" wrote one Weibo user.\n\nAnother commented, \"Without AI as the biggest selling point, it should be half price.\"\n\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will cost the same as models they replace. In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, as government restrictions on the use of foreign-branded phones and increased domestic competition weighed on its smartphone sales.\n\nOther users on Weibo compared Apple's launch with Huawei's new phone, due to be released as the Chinese firm seeks to widen its lead over Apple in its home market.\n\n\"Whether iPhone 16 has AI or not doesn't affect me, because I'm going to buy Huawei's tri-fold phone,\" one Weibo user wrote, underscoring the growing popularity of Huawei's latest models in China that helped it replace Apple as the country's No.3 smartphone vendor in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut some analysts predicted the absence of AI features in the iPhone 16 was unlikely to have a big impact on near term sales.\n\n\"Chinese consumers are not yet driven to upgrade by AI capabilities ... However, in the long run, as domestic brands use AI as a key differentiator for their flagship products, it will negatively affect Apple,\" said Toby Zhu, an analyst at technology market research firm Canalys.\n\nZhu said Apple needs to localise its offerings and swiftly establish an AI application and service ecosystem in China to remain competitive.\n\nApple's powerful operating system remains a draw for Chinese consumers, according to Will Wong, an analyst at IDC.\n\n\"The key competitive advantage of Apple is its strong customer stickiness. Thus, the replacement needs of the users of the iPhone 11, 12, or 13 series could still support the sales of Apple in the absence of AI.\"\n\n\"It's still too early to say who will win,\" Wong said.\n\nPre-orders for the new iPhone start on Friday in China through online retailers such as JD.com, with deliveries beginning on Sept. 20.\n\n(Reporting by Liam Mo and Casey Hall; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Sonali Paul)",

        "content": "By David Kirton\n\nSHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies unveils a three-way foldable phone on Tuesday, as it seeks to widen its lead over Apple in the world's biggest smartphone market with a new form factor that has gained popularity in the China market.\n\nJust hours after Apple unveiled its latest iPhone model, Huawei is holding a launch event of the new Z-shaped smartphone Mate XT which was displayed on its flagship e-commerce stores in mainland China a day earlier.\n\nHuawei's website showed on Tuesday that it had garnered more than 3.3 million pre-orders, for which no deposit is required, for the new smartphone.\n\nBy comparison, the entire global market for foldable phones was around 4 million units in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC.\n\nThe latest launch, which follows a series of successful smartphone debuts since last year, underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China.\n\nHuawei already has two-way foldable phones in its lineup and their strong sales in China helped it overtake Samsung Electronics this year as the biggest vendor of such phones globally.\n\nBut the hefty price tag and limited quantity are likely to make the new model more of a symbol of Huawei's tech prowess than a major sales driver, analysts said.\n\n\"The upcoming Huawei products are not expected to significantly impact Samsung and Apple's businesses in terms of product quantity,\" said Jene Park, an analyst at research firm Counterpoint.\n\n\"There is a limit to the quantity of products supplied. However, there may be some impact on sales in certain Chinese markets.\"\n\nThe foldable smartphone market grew 57% year-on-year in the second quarter with 3.9 million units shipped, largely as Chinese smartphone makers pushed into overseas markets, according to consultancy IDC.\n\nThat still remains just 1.3% of the wider smartphone market, with 292.2 million smartphones shipped in the second quarter, IDC said.\n\n\"The average consumer still has limited knowledge about them, not to mention the benefits and value of the products,\" said Will Wong, a senior researcher with IDC.\n\nHigh prices of such models remain another barrier. While the new model's price tag is unknown, last year's Mate X5 still retails for over 10,000 yuan ($1,406) domestically, almost twice as much as a new iPhone 15.\n\nOvercoming issues such as screen wrinkles and reduced durability due to the use of more hinges will also be important for foldables' increasing usage, said Park.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei ranked as the world's biggest foldable smartphone seller in the second quarter with a 27.5% market share, ahead of South Korea's Samsung, with 16.4%, according to IDC.\n\nThat share rises to 42% in China's home market, ahead of Vivo and former Huawei unit Honor, which it spun off under pressure from U.S. sanctions in 2020.\n\nIn the broader smartphone market in China, Apple's ranking fell from third to sixth place in the second quarter, as Huawei emerged as the third-largest vendor on the back of strong sales of its latest smartphones.\n\n($1 = 7.1105 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen and Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Stephen Coates)",

        "content": "The Magnificent 7 group has been at the forefront of market headlines over the last year thanks to their strong performance, which has been driven by robust earnings results. The mega-cap giants have only gotten larger, making them that much more scrutinized.\n\nAnd today, a member of the club, Apple AAPL, hosted its Apple Event, showcasing new products and other features aimed at consumers. It’ll be a busy month for the company, particularly as the latest iPhone model gets rolled out to consumers.\n\nBut what should investors know about the event? Let’s take a closer look at a few announcements.\n\nApple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro\n\nUnsurprisingly, the iPhone 16 Pro was a major focal point during the event, with the company unveiling several new features for the model. A few of the notable features include better battery life, AI capabilities (coming later this fall), and the biggest display screen yet.\n\nImportantly, the iPhone 16 Pro is built for Apple Intelligence, which is the personal intelligence system that helps consumers write, express themselves, and get things done effortlessly. In addition, the iPhone 16’s glass is reportedly two times tougher than any other smartphone glass, providing a durable nature.\n\nThe company’s iPhone results have been somewhat mixed as of late, delivering both misses and beats over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe new Apple Watch 10 was also unveiled, featuring its biggest and most advanced display yet. The watch also comes with Apple’s first wide-angle OLED Display, making screen reading easier at a glance. Similar to the iPhone, Apple’s Wearable results have been somewhat mixed as of late, exceeding and falling short of expectations over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAre Apple Shares a Buy?\n\nApple’s earnings outlook has shifted bullishly across the board over the last several months, with the trend particularly notable for its current and next fiscal years. The mega-cap giant is forecasted to post 9% EPS growth on 2% higher sales in FY24. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares trade at elevated valuation multiples, consistent with its history over the years being a high-growth name. Still, the current PEG ratio works out to 2.3X, above the five-year median considerably and suggesting that investors are paying a premium for the earnings growth expected.\n\nIt’s been no secret that the company’s growth has been stalling, but perhaps recent news surrounding its new lineup of products can reverse the trend. Apple is in the very early innings of its AI offerings, a key aspect to keep in mind when sizing up its long-term prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd despite slowing growth, the company still remains a cash-generating machine, posting $34.1 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTech titan Apple AAPL unveiled several new products and models in today’s event, kicking off a big September for the company. The biggest highlight of the event for investors is likely the news surrounding the AI offerings inside the iPhone 16 Pro, though it’s critical to note that it won’t initially come loaded with these features.\n\nA sleeker Apple Watch and new versions of AirPods will also help keep its Wearables segment healthy, which has shown great growth over recent years.\n\nAll in all, Apple could be seen as a dark horse in the AI race, keeping things relatively quiet compared to many other companies touting their offerings. While the valuation multiples are a bit rich for the current forecasted growth, the stock remains a prime long-term selection for investors’ portfolios given its immense earnings power and cash-rich position.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple details Watch Series 10 and its features",
        "content": "The upcoming model of Apple’s smartwatch will have a larger display and multiple new features.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10, unveiled Monday during Apple’s \"Glowtime\" event, will come with a display that provides \"up to 30 percent more active screen area\" than the Series 4, 5 and 6 and \"up to 9 percent more\" than the Series 7, 8 and 9, the tech giant announced Monday.\n\nRounding the corners of the case and giving it a wider aspect ratio helped Apple achieve that feat without increasing the size of the case significantly, according to Apple. The case size options for the Series 10 are 42 mm and 46 mm, up 1 mm from the Series 9.\n\nApple has also reduced the thickness of its smartwatch with the Series 10, designing it to be almost 10% thinner than its predecessor.\n\nAPPLE HITS ALL-TIME HIGH AS MORGAN STANLEY TOUTS STOCK AS ‘TOP PICK’ FOR AI\n\n\"Apple Watch Series 10 builds on a decade of breakthrough innovations to offer the most advanced version yet, with even more intelligence, our biggest wearable display, and a design that’s slimmer and sleeker than ever,\" Apple COO Jeff Williams said in a press release.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe newest version of the Apple smartwatch will have the ability to play audio from numerous Apple and third-party apps through its speaker.\n\nApple also said the Series 10 has an upgraded charging coil that \"means users can charge to 80 percent battery in about 30 minutes.\"\n\nAnother notable addition to the latest Apple Watch is sleep apnea notifications. The smartwatch will track \"breathing disturbances\" during sleep and analyze it using a special algorithm to send those messages, according to Apple.\n\nThe Series 10 will run on watchOS 11. That will include a new app showing \"key overnight health metrics,\" more customization options for \"Activity Rings,\" an upgrade for \"Smart Stack,\" double-tap scrolling capability and more, per the company.\n\nApple has already started accepting preorders for the Series 10 and will officially launch the new smartwatch late next week. Series 10 watches will have different starting price tags based on the material of their cases, with aluminum costing $399 and titanium costing $699, it said.\n\nThe upgraded Apple Watch Ultra 2, also unveiled Monday, has the same release timeline as the Series 10.\n\nThe unveiling of Apple’s latest smartwatches coincided with the tech giant providing details about its four new iPhone models — the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nAPPLE UNVEILS THE IPHONE 16\n\nStory continues\n\nThose will also start hitting the market Sept. 20. Their preorders open Friday, later than the smartwatches.\n\nIn addition to those products, Apple used \"Glowtime\" to introduce AirPods 4 and revamped AirPods Max.\n\nThe company’s stock price ended the trading day roughly flat from where it opened amid investors reacting to the product updates.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple details Watch Series 10 and its features\n\nView comments",

        "title": "IPhone’s Camera Control Button Stands Out as Most Visible Change",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- From the outside, Apple Inc.’s latest iPhones aren’t strikingly different than last year’s models — other than a small button nestled into the lower right side.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\n\nThis feature, the Camera Control button, is included in all four versions of the new iPhone 16 and looks like a slightly recessed groove. Pressing it once instantly brings up the camera launch screen, letting you fine-tune the shot. A second touch will take the photo.\n\nThe idea is to replicate the experience of using the shutter button on a digital single-lens reflex camera — better known as a DSLR. The process is pretty simple and works best with the phone held in your right hand, using your thumb on the button. It’s possible to do it with your left hand, though it might require a bit more fiddling.\n\nFrom there, it gets a little less intuitive. While doing a hands-on test of the technology at Apple’s campus in Cupertino, California, it took time to get the hang of some of the button’s other functions.\n\nBeyond pressing down to take a shot or start a video, you can maintain your finger’s contact with the button and double-tap lightly to toggle through camera options. You can also adjust the zoom level or — depending on the mode you’ve selected — change other settings by sliding the finger across the button.\n\nThis part didn’t always go smoothly. A number of people testing the feature, as well as some Apple staff, struggled to activate the mode toggle the first time.\n\nThere are some other subtle changes to the iPhone lineup. The Pro versions now have slightly larger screen sizes, checking in at 6.3 and 6.9 inches depending on the model. They also have the tinniest borders of any Apple product, helping maximize that screen real estate.\n\nEven so, many consumers might not notice the difference. The iPhone 16 Pro’s 6.3-inch screen doesn’t appear remarkably large when held up against its 6.1-inch predecessor.\n\nMore substantive changes will come in the form of software updates — most notably, a suite of AI tools called Apple Intelligence. But you’ll have to be patient: A beta version of that technology will debut next month, well after the iPhones go on sale.\n\nThe early iteration of Apple Intelligence will center on text summarization, generating responses in email and other messages, and photo editing. Those capabilities were impressive during tests, but also in line with what’s available through the likes of Adobe Inc. and Google.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 16 Pro also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera — something that does seem like a step up for the photography enthusiast.\n\nSiri, the voice assistant, has a refreshed interface. When triggered, the feature lights up around the border of the phone. You also can pose questions to Siri voice-free by typing in a command bar.\n\nThe phones have more powerful processors, and this is evident when switching between between applications and handling other tasks. Apple also has described the new Pro Max phone as having the best iPhone battery life ever — something that seemed especially appealing after I drained my 15 Pro’s battery during the event.\n\nApple kept the prices steady for the new lineup. The iPhone 16 starts at $799, with the Plus model priced at $899. The iPhone 16 Pro is $999, and the Pro Max begins at $1,199. Preorders begin Friday, with the phones shipping on Sept. 20.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Apple Intelligence will also upgrade Apple's virtual assistant Siri to get it to better understand requests and give it some awareness of on-screen actions taking place on the phone, hopefully making it more useful.\n\nWhat sets Apple apart from what's being offered by rivals Samsung and Google? It is trying to preserve its longtime commitment to privacy by tailoring its AI so that most of its functions are processed on the device itself instead of at remote data centers. When a task requires a connection to a data center, Apple promises it will be done in a tightly controlled way that ensures no personal data is stored remotely.\n\nMost of Apple’s AI functions will roll out as part of a free software update to iOS 18, the operating system that will power the iPhone 16 rolling out from October through December. U.S. English will be the featured language at launch but an update enabling other languages will come out next year, according to Apple.\n\niPhone 16 and the camera button\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will offer slightly bigger displays and feature variants of the powerful A18 chip, which gives Apple the computing power its devices need to run AI functions on its devices.\n\nThe iPhone 16 “has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,” CEO Tim Cook said during Monday's event.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the biggest physical change to the iPhone 16 lineup comes in the form of a dedicated camera-control button. The button responds to clicks and gestures, allowing users to quickly snap pictures, preview a shot or start video recording.\n\nThe button also allows owners to use something called Visual Intelligence, which will tell the iPhone 16 to automatically search on things you take photos of.\n\nThe phones will start shipping Sept. 20. The iPhone 16 will retail for $799, with the Plus model going for $899. The iPhone 16 Pro will cost $999, while the Pro Max will sell for $1,199.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Watch upgrades\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 features a larger, and brighter, wide-angle OLED display that will allow users to better view the watch at an angle. But Apple focused much of its presentation on the device's ability to detect signs of sleep apnea.\n\nThe new device is also being offered in a titanium finish for the first time, joining a longtime trend in the watch industry of offering a tougher, more lightweight, and perceived higher-quality, alternative to traditional materials.\n\nThe Series 10 watch starts at $399 and will be available on Sept. 20.\n\nAirpods lean toward being a listening device\n\nThe new AirPods 4 series will come with an upgraded chip for better audio quality, and will feature more active noise cancellation.\n\nIf you frequently lose your ear buds, the new AirPods will also play a sound when you locate them through the Find My app.\n\nIn a medically focused update to the AirPods Pro 2, Apple said it will upgrade the devices so they can act as an over-the-counter hearing aid. A free software update will provide the upgrade and also include options to help protect hearing and the ability to administer a clinical-grade hearing test.\n\nThe AirPod 4 model costs $129, while the version with active noise cancelling will cost $179. They both ship on Sept. 20.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Big Company Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other big company stocks.\n\nMega-cap stocks—major technology companies to be precise—continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500’s 40%+ gain.\n\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies’ stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\n\n3Q 2024 Earnings Season – A Preview\n\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\n\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks.  Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\n\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\n\nAmidst Worries, Investors Should Stick to Big Company Stocks\n\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\n\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\n\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\n\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the big and well-established companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, markets, and sells smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and related accessories.\n\nHigh customer switching costs, intangible assets, and network effects around the company’s iOS ecosystem continue to strengthen Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s competitive positioning. The company is expected to be supported by a higher mix of premium products. These include iPhone Pro models which should help improve gross margins moving forward. The market is quite optimistic about its new product, the iPhone 16, and the launch of Apple Intelligence. Generative AI acts as a perfect fit for the seamless experience of using iOS products.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s attached services – which include App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – help the company realize higher margins and a recurring revenue stream which should help improve the value proposition for hardware products, and the financial profile. Apple Intelligence is expected to drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and should result in increased demand for Apple services. The company’s investment in AI, with the launch of the new Apple Intelligence platform, should accelerate its future growth by improving user experiences throughout its ecosystem.\n\nThe company released results for 3Q 2024, with revenues reaching $85.78 billion (a record). This exhibits a rise of 5% on the YoY basis. This growth primarily stemmed from a 14% growth in services revenue, which touched an all-time high of $24.21 billion. Services such as iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store have supported the tech giant in achieving financial success, exhibiting its ability to perform well even in a challenging environment.\n\nBank of America reissued a “Buy” rating on the shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), giving it a price target of $256.00 on 5th September 2024. As per Insider Monkey’s 2Q 2024 data, 184 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nBaron Funds, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best big company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. introduced the latest version of its flagship product, the iPhone 16, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying it was designed to take advantage of artificial intelligence from the “ground up.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus Rome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain\n\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will be available in new colors and get a customizable Action button that had only been available on higher-end models, Apple said during a presentation streamed from its headquarters Monday in Cupertino, California. And there’s a Camera Control button that lets you snap pictures and access camera capabilities.\n\nApple also unveiled a version of its smartwatch with a bigger screen and the ability to detect sleep apnea, as well as new software that can turn AirPods into hearing aids.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been a major theme of the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. local time. The company has been readying a suite of AI tools called Apple Intelligence that it hopes will entice consumers to buy upgraded devices. Customers will need a recent iPhone — Apple’s flagship product — to handle the capabilities.\n\nApple Intelligence will include an upgraded Siri digital assistant and the ability to create custom emoji with text prompts. The event’s “Glowtime” theme is a reference to the look of Siri’s new interface. But much of the technology won’t arrive until the coming months, potentially limiting its impact on iPhone sales.\n\nApple Watch\n\nThe Series 10 version of the watch has 30% more screen area, even with a thinner design, Apple said. The sleep apnea feature will be available in more than 150 regions, the company said.\n\nThe new watch is about 10% thinner than the Series 9 version. It also comes in a new titanium model that’s lighter than aluminum models. The device starts at $399 and will be released Sept. 20. A new version of the higher-end Ultra version also was announced, and it goes on sale that day for $799.\n\nThe event included an updated version of the standard $129 AirPods, which shrinks the size of the case and adds a USB-C charger. A $179 version also will be available — a midrange product — with noise cancellation. That used to only be available on the higher-end AirPods Pro.\n\nThe company introduced a new line of $549 AirPods Max headphones in new colors, also with USB-C charging. Like the other new products, the new devices will debut on Sept. 20. Apple didn’t debut a new version of its AirPods Pro, but introduced new features such as a hearing test and the ability to act as a hearing aid. Those capabilities will be offered as a software update this fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvent Timing\n\nThe iPhone debut is usually Apple’s most important announcement of the year. The device accounts for roughly half of the company’s annual revenue, and it helps fuel additional sales in the form of accessories and services.\n\nApple doesn’t typically hold its iPhone event on a Monday, but the earlier timing lets the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: A US presidential debate is scheduled for that day, and the European Commission is set to announce whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes.\n\nApple is playing catch-up in the world of generative artificial intelligence, where tech peers like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. have made strides. Monday’s presentation is partly a pitch to consumers — and Wall Street — that Apple should be taken seriously in AI.\n\nBut the company’s AI technology is still in early stages. Apple Intelligence has faced numerous delays, and many key features won’t arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the gee-whiz capabilities of rival systems.\n\n(Updates with more from presentation starting in first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple touts latest AI tools as it unveils iPhone 16",
        "content": "Apple on Monday unveiled its newest generation of iPhones, with the usual improvements to their cameras and computing power. But this time, the company touted an additional selling point: artificial intelligence tools.\n\nThe new iPhone 16 and 16 Pro will be the first smartphones built with Apple Intelligence, with the fast-advancing technology in mind. Apple Intelligence is the iPhone maker's suite of AI tools that are supposed to make the devices and their software better and easier to use.\n\nApple Intelligence, for example, can make suggestions to users while writing emails, can quickly surface old photos based on a user's description and assist with scheduling meetings by factoring in driving time. Additionally, the latest version of Siri can pull information collected from OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT (with the iPhone user's permission).\n\nBut will Apple Intelligence be enough to convince Apple customers to buy a new smartphone?\n\n\"The business model is predicated on the fact that they believe Apple Intelligence is enough to get people to upgrade, and they're probably going to be right,\" said Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Palo Alto-based Constellation Research. \"This is really about anything that's a time-saving category, anything that actually helps you create faster.\"\n\nThe iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will be available for preorder on Friday and in stores on Sept. 20. The iPhone 16, which has a 6.1-inch display, will start at $799; the 6.7-inch display 16 Plus starts at $899. The 16 Pro, with a 6.3-inch display, starts at $999 and 16 Pro Max, with a 6.9-inch display, starts at $1,199. Apple Intelligence will be available starting next month, including on older devices iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.\n\nWang estimates Apple has an iPhone install base of 1.3 billion, with 240 million of that base upgrading to the next-generation machines.\n\nRead more:Apple announces deal with OpenAI. Will it be a game-changer?\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone maker has touted Apple Intelligence as more mindful of customer privacy than its AI competitors. Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing. For requests that require use of the cloud, the devices “do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection,” according to the company. The data are not retained or exposed.\n\n\"The next generation of iPhone have been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook, during a presentation at Apple's headquarters on Monday. \"It marks the beginning of an exciting new era.\"\n\nApple first announced Apple Intelligence at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. It was immediately criticized by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who runs his own artificial intelligence company that competes with OpenAI. Musk expressed concern that a partnership between Apple and OpenAI could pose security risks.\n\nSome security researchers including Alex Stamos, chief trust officer at Mountain View, Calif.-based cybersecurity company SentinelOne and former chief security officer at Facebook, have pushed back on Musk's allegations.\n\nRead more:Elon Musk blasts Apple's OpenAI deal over alleged privacy issues. Does he have a point?\n\nOver the years, the capabilities of AI have significantly advanced, giving digital chatbots the ability to tell bedtime stories to children, detect emotions in human users and offer suggestions for breathing exercises. In the entertainment industry, tools like OpenAI's Sora have caused excitement among some filmmakers, who say they can be used to test bold ideas and save money; but they also fear that such tools will displace many workers.\n\nOn Monday, Apple executives touted AI's potential benefits for consumers.\n\nThe iPhone 16, with a 48-megapixel camera, will have new software and hardware that will improve the way customers use cameras on their phone. They can click and hold the camera's control button to take a photo of a dog and find out what its breed is, or snap a pic of a flier marketing a local event and add it to their calendar.\n\nSiri also is able to contextualize information. For example, it's possible for users to tell iPhone 16's Siri to send a specific friend from their contacts photos from a Saturday barbecue.\n\nThe iPhone remains Apple's most popular product, representing 46% of the company's sales in its fiscal third quarter. But revenue for Apple's smartphones declined earlier this year due to weaker sales in China. Some analysts believe that the new AI-powered iPhone 16 and 16 Pro will change that.\n\n\"Our view is betting against Cook and Cupertino into an AI-driven supercycle led by iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence is the wrong move for investors as the renaissance of growth returns to the Apple story,\" said Daniel Ives, a managing director with Wedbush Securities, in an Aug. 1 report. Ives has an \"outperform\" rating on the stock.\n\nRead more:What the DOJ's antitrust suit against Apple means for everyone with an iPhone\n\nApple also announced that its wireless earbuds, AirPods Pro 2, will offer hearing tests and could serve as a hearing aid for people with mild to moderate hearing loss later this fall in more than 100 countries including the U.S. The company said it is waiting to receive marketing authorization from health authorities.\n\nThere were also additional features for the next-generation AirPods 4, allowing users to have clearer phone calls even when walking through noisy environments. AirPods 4 will be available in stores on Sept. 20.\n\nThe company also shared news that its Apple Watch Series 10 will have larger display and faster-charging battery. Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399 and will be available in Apple stores on Sept. 20.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) announced updates to its entire Apple Watch lineup during its annual iPhone event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday. The changes include a new Apple Watch Series 10 and updates to its Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10, which start at $399, gets the biggest changes of the lot, with Apple increasing the display size of the 41-millimeter model to 45 mm and the previous 45-mm edition to 49 mm. The watches also sport slimmer casings than their predecessors.\n\nThe displays offer up to 30% more screen area than the Apple Watch Series 6, giving users can space to view more text and making it easier to type messages, enter passcodes, and check emails.\n\nThe Apple Watch also gets rounded corners giving it a more streamlined look, and Apple's first-ever wide-angle OLED display that's designed to look 40% brighter when viewed at an angle, it also updates every second rather than once a minute.\n\nDespite its larger, brighter displays, Apple says the Apple Watch is its thinnest smartwatch yet. What's more, it features a new speaker that you can finally use to play audio.\n\nOn the battery front, Apple says the Apple Watch can charge to 80% in just 30 minutes. So, if you use the watch to track your sleep, you can drop it onto its charger and top it off before heading out the door for the day.\n\nInside, the Apple Watch is powered by Apple's new S10 chip, which enables things like on-board Siri, Crash Detection, and Double Tap. Apple says the Series 10 also uses new neural networks for improved phone calls. Apple Watch 10 features\n\nHealth tracking features are a major selling point for the Apple Watch, and Apple is expanding on that with a new sleep apnea detection function that will alert users if it determines they are exhibiting signs of a sleep disorder and tell them they should visit a doctor. I've got sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine every night, so I'll be able to tell how well the watch is able to pick up the condition.\n\nThe detection algorithm uses machine learning and clinic grade sleep apnea tests. Apple says it expects clearance from the FDA soon and it will be available in more than 150 regions. The feature is also coming to the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nOn fitness tracking, Apple says the Series 10 gets a new depth detection function for diving and snorkeling. The company is also introducing tides information as part of watchOS 11 to provide users with information before they hit the beach. There's also improved tracking for paddling on the water.\n\nThe $799 Apple Watch Ultra 2 doesn't get much in terms of physical updates, though Apple is adding a new satin black finish. The company is positioning the Ultra 2 as the ultimate sports watch in Apple's portfolio, with Apple saying it's great for running, biking, swimming, golfing, and skiing.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince its debut 10 years ago, the Apple Watch line has become one of Apple's most popular iPhone accessories and one of the bestselling smartwatches in the world. Apple doesn't provide overall Apple Watch revenue and instead counts it as part of its Wearables, Home, and Accessories business.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, the segment brought in $8 billion, down from $8.2 billion in the same quarter last year. Across all of 2023, Apple's Wearables business accounted for $39.8 billion of the company's $383 billion in sales. That was more than its Mac and iPad segments but well below its iPhone business, which brought in $200 billion for the year. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL “It’s Glowtime” event is due to take place at the iconic Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino today. The technology giant is set to unveil the iPhone 16 series smartphones and other major products, including a new version of AirPods and three new Apple Watches.\r\n \r\nAhead of the event, ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan are in focus. Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation. These ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInsights Into the Potential Launch\n\niPhone 16: Apple is projected to release four versions of the iPhone 16 series — the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. All the models will feature generative AI capabilities as the tech behemoth looks to bolster sales of its iconic device. The iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus are expected to be powered by the A18 Bionic chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max may come with the A18 Pro chip.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are likely to get a major performance boost with the addition of the Apple A18 chipset and a base 8GB RAM variant (up from 6GB last year). Meanwhile, the new iPhone 16 Pro models are likely to be powered by the A18 Pro chipset with support for 8GB of RAM. They are also likely to get an improved Neural Engine, which is likely to be a big marketing strategy for Apple to show off its AI capabilities (read: Tech ETFs That Won Amid NVIDIA-Led Tech Rout).\r\n\r\nRumors also suggest that there could be a new touch-sensitive “Capture Button,” which could make its debut on the iPhone 16 Pro variants. Apple is also likely to introduce a new gold titanium color this year, replacing last year's blue titanium variant.\r\n\r\nAirPods: Apple is expected to replace the AirPods 2 with an entry-level AirPods 4 variant, featuring a modern design and improved audio capabilities. Apple might also replace the 2021 AirPods 3 with a higher-end AirPods 4 variant. Both new AirPods models are expected to feature a similar design. The higher-end model is expected to keep the AirPods 4 tag, while the entry-level model may get rebranded as “AirPods Lite.”\r\n\r\nApple Watch: Apple is expected to debut the new Apple Watch Series 10 at the event, along with the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Speculations are also buzzing that Apple may also launch a more affordable third-generation Apple Watch SE.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid Fundamentals\n\nApple boasts the world’s highest stock market valuation, at nearly $3.3 trillion. It has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents for the current fiscal year (ending September 2024) and three cents for the next fiscal over the past 30 days. \r\n\r\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. Of the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 36 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 90% and 7.5% of all recommendations. \r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the average price target for Microsoft comes to $499.58. The forecasts range from a low of $375.00 to a high of $600.00. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Growth Score of B, suggesting that the iPhone maker is primed for growth. Apple stock is cheap, trading at a P/E ratio of 32.97 compared with Amazon’s (AMZN) 36.13 times, and Netflix’s (NFLX) 34.89 times (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) - Apple accounts for a 17.2% share.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC) - Apple accounts for a 17.5% share in the basket. \r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW) - Apple makes up 16.7% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (IWY) - Apple accounts for a 14% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) - Apple accounts for 13.4% of the total assets\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Calculating The Fair Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$240 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$221 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$238 analyst price target for AAPL is 1.1% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nIs Apple Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.0b US$135.5b US$163.8b US$177.5b US$188.0b US$197.2b US$205.5b US$213.0b US$220.1b US$226.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x10 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.92% Est @ 4.89% Est @ 4.18% Est @ 3.67% Est @ 3.32% Est @ 3.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$117.7k US$132.7k US$134.1k US$132.4k US$129.4k US$125.7k US$121.5k US$117.0k US$112.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$227b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.5%) = US$4.9t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.9t÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.4t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.7t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$221, the company appears about fair value at a 8.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.158. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.12 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.22 billion and $424.35 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +8.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tech giant Huawei has garnered more than 3 million pre-orders for its triple-folding smartphone, its website showed on Monday, which comes just hours before Apple's debut of its new generation of iPhones.\n\nHuawei's Mate XT, a Z-shaped tri-fold phone is scheduled to be unveiled at a launch event on Tuesday, as announced on its social media account WeChat.\n\nPre-ordering customers will receive details on how to purchase the phone on Tuesday, the day of the launch event, rather than making a down payment.\n\nThis robust pre-order figure underscores Huawei's ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position as a key competitor to Apple, which has cut prices earlier this year to sustain its market share.\n\nThe Huawei launch event will take place shortly after Apple's Sept. 9 event, where the company is set to introduce its iPhone 16 lineup, emphasising the integration of artificial intelligence features in its flagship devices.\n\nHuawei was the biggest foldable phone seller in China in the second quarter, with a 42% domestic market share, according to consultancy IDC.\n\n(Reporting by Ella Cao and David Kirton, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

        "title": "iPhone 16: Release date, prices and new rumoured features",
        "content": "Apple's latest gadgets will be geared to take advantage of the tech giant’s AI software - Justin Sullivan/Getty Images North America\n\nApple is on Monday poised to unveil its iPhone 16 at an annual launch event in California, as the US tech giant seeks to entice consumers with a raft of new artificial intelligence (AI) features.\n\nAt the company’s so-called Glowtime event, Apple is planning to unveil four new iPhone models, as well as new AirPods and a revamped Apple Watch.\n\nIts latest gadgets will be geared to take advantage of the tech giant’s AI software, known as Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis is powered by new A18 microchip processors, which analysts hope will trigger a surge in sales.\n\n“This iPhone 16 release is all about Apple Intelligence and the unleashing of the consumer AI revolution,” says Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe tech giant will show off its new gadgets at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, starting at 6pm UK time.\n\nHere is everything you need to know ahead of the event.\n\nIPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro: rumoured features\n\nWhile Apple is always tight-lipped ahead of its launch events, the tech giant is expected to debut four new iPhone 16 models.\n\nThis includes the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\n\nThe iPhone 16 is expected to have a screen size of 6.1 inches, while the Plus will have a 6.7-inch display. The Pro versions will be slightly larger at 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches respectively.\n\nThe gadgets will look broadly similar to other iPhones of recent years. The iPhone 16 models will come with a dual rear camera and the Pro variant with a triple rear set-up.\n\nHowever, all the phones will come with a new “capture” or “camera” button that will act similar to a shutter button on a regular camera – with added touch and swipe functions.\n\nThe phones will also include a programmable action button, which can be linked to quick-launch different features.\n\nWhat is Apple Intelligence and when will it be released?\n\nAlongside its new iPhones, Apple will also be upgrading its smartphone software later this month with iOS 18.\n\nThe new software will come with Apple Intelligence, a suite of tools and apps reliant on AI. This will include a revamped Siri digital assistant and a host of writing tools.\n\nThis will include AI-powered features that can reply to emails, draft blog posts and presentations, create synthetic artwork and design customised emojis.\n\nApple Intelligence will also grant users access to ChatGPT, the digital assistant from Silicon Valley start-up OpenAI.\n\nApple has previously said: “Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHow much will the iPhone 16 cost?\n\nThe iPhone 16’s pricing is widely anticipated to mirror the cost of its previous iPhone 15 model upon launch.\n\nAnalysts from TrendForce believe the iPhone16 will start at $799 (£611), while the iPhone 16 Plus will come in at $899. The pricier iPhone 16 Pro will start at $1,099 and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will cost $1,199.\n\nShould its UK price structure remain the same as the iPhone 15, the iPhone 16 will start at £799 in Britain. The iPhone is typically more expensive in the UK owing to taxes and exchange rates.\n\nIPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro release date\n\nFollowing Monday’s launch event, the new iPhone 16 is expected to be available for pre-order from Friday Sept 13, and will then go on full sale a week later on Sept 20.\n\nHowever, some of the crucial new software features may not be available immediately.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to be released in October, while customers in the EU will not get the new software until 2025 because of regulatory delays.\n\nWhat about the Apple Watch and AirPods?\n\nApple is also looking to release a new low-end version of its AirPod headphones, the AirPods 4.\n\nIt will also debut a revamped version of its larger, over-ear headphones, which will be known as the AirPods Max.\n\nThe new Apple Watch X is also expected to be launched, boasting new health features and a slimline design.\n\nHow can I watch Apple’s Glowtime event?\n\nApple’s Glowtime live event is expected to start at 6pm UK time and will be available to watch on Apple’s website and its YouTube channel.",

        "title": "Post-payrolls foothold, new iPhones and debate",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nWall Street futures have found their feet after Friday's exaggerated market reaction to an otherwise middling employment report - with Apple's new iPhone and Tuesday's presidential candidates' debate next up on the radar.\n\nThe August payrolls report was modestly weaker than forecast, even if a significant improvement on July. Downward revisions to prior months softened the picture a bit more.\n\nBut the report was neither strong enough to completely dispel slowdown and recession fears for next year nor was it seen to be weak enough to nudge the Federal Reserve into a jumbo 50-basis-point interest rate cut this month.\n\nTop Fed policymakers Christopher Waller and John Williams underscored expectations that a Sept. 18 cut is coming - the former even said the easing cycle should be 'frontloaded'. But neither seemed panicked enough to suggest 50 bps was needed yet.\n\nBy the close, the S&P500 was down 1.7% - clocking a 4.5% loss for the week that now stands as its worst since March 2023 and underlines yet again the seasonal downdraft that typically comes with September.\n\nFollowing suit in a more measured fashion, Asian markets slipped early on Monday too.\n\nAnd yet despite markets scaling back the expected size of this month's Fed rate cut, there's been no change to 112 bps of Fed rate cuts priced in by year-end, nor the 235bps seen over the next 12 months.\n\nTen-year Treasury yields hit on Friday their lowest since June last year and two-year yields their lowest since March 2023. Both firmed up a tad on Monday ahead of the week's auctions of $119 billion of 3-, 10- and 30-year Treasury coupons.\n\nU.S. stock futures and European bourses bounced back smartly today ahead of another crammed week - a likely second European Central Bank rate cut of the year on Thursday, Apple's release of its new AI-infused iPhone on Monday and Tuesday's televised face-off in the White House race.\n\nThe euro was on the backfoot ahead of the ECB decision, with likely cuts to the central bank's GDP and inflation forecasts on Thursday keeping some hopes alive of a third rate reduction as soon as next month.\n\nEven though the Fed seems to have pivoted clearly toward the employment side of its dual mandate rather than the inflation one, the August CPI inflation report on Wednesday will be important to assess the degree of ongoing disinflation.\n\nOn that score the deflationary pressures from overseas remain powerful, with China recording deep annual producer price deflation of 1.8% once again last month and a meagre consumer price inflation rate of just 0.6% that also missed forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCommodity markets are doubling down on that disinflation. Even though oil prices had a toehold on Monday, U.S. crude remains below $70 per barrel after hitting a 15-month low on Friday and is still recording year-on-year declines of more than 20%.\n\nU.S. market inflation expectations are evaporating fast.\n\nThe 10-year 'breakeven' inflation view embedded in inflation-protected Treasuries is now at just 2.04% - its lowest since January 2021. The two-year equivalent is just 1.87% - well below the Fed's 2% target and raising the risk that significant undershoot of that goal may be in store.\n\nThe New York Fed publishes its August survey of household inflation expectations later on Monday.\n\nBack in politics, the U.S. election race heats up again this week with Tuesday's first televised debate between U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican challenger Donald Trump.\n\nThe stakes remain high as national opinion polls show the two neck and neck again after a brief period in which Harris gained the ascendancy following her nomination.\n\nA poll conducted by The New York Times and Siena College released on Sunday showed the two effectively tied, with Trump up one percentage point - 48%-47% - over Harris.\n\nThe PredictIt betting site has them in a dead heat again too.\n\nIn Europe, former ECB chief and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi delivered his long-awaited report into reforming Europe's economy, urging the European Union to adopt a more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it's to keep pace with the United States and China.\n\nIn company news, all eyes will be on Apple's new iPhone series later on Monday. Its stock was indicated up 1.6% ahead of the bell, alongside most of the other Big Tech megacaps.\n\nThe Financial Times newspaper reported on Saturday that the latest iPhone's A18 chip, which is set to be unveiled at Monday's event, has been developed using Arm's newest V9 chip design.\n\nAnd Boeing shares rose 3% in U.S. premarket trading after the planemaker reached a tentative deal with a union in the U.S. Pacific Northwest that could avoid a possible crippling strike later this week.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:\n\n* New York Fed's inflation expectations survey, US August employment trends, July consumer credit; Mexico August inflation\n\n* Apple unveils new iPhone series\n\n* US corporate earnings: Oracle\n\n* US Treasury sells 3-, 6-month bills\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Kenrick Cai\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple on Monday is set to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup, focusing on how its flagship device's features have been infused with artificial intelligence, rather than its usual emphasis on hardware upgrades.\n\nThe event at the tech giant's Apple Park headquarters at 10 a.m. PDT (1700 GMT) follows its developer conference in June during which the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.\n\nIt had also showed off an improved version of voice assistant Siri, featuring an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nThe refresh comes as iPhones face stiff competition from Huawei in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them. Huawei itself has scheduled its own product announcement mere hours after Apple's event.\n\nApple Intelligence must be approved by Beijing in order to be released in the Chinese market. In July, OpenAI blocked access to ChatGPT in China, a move that could impact the chatbot's integration into Siri.\n\n\"The Chinese market is hungrier for AI features than the U.S. market,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. \"It will be very difficult to bring it to China immediately, so they'll be going off the merits of the hardware.\"\n\nIPhones accounted for more than half of Apple's $383 billion sales last year, and the new devices are an important update for the Cupertino, California-based company that is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales.\n\nIn China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition.\n\nThe iPhone 16 lineup will be the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features, though those will also be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices. New versions of the Apple Watch and AirPods are also expected.\n\n\"The software side, and how Apple frames it, is the biggest question,\" said Bajarin. \"Investors will look for if it's compelling enough to have a larger than normal upgrade cycle.\"\n\nRivals including Alphabet's Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apple's dominance in the high-end smartphone market.\n\nGoogle, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apple's iOS, traditionally announced its Pixel smartphones in the autumn. This year, it pushed the event to August ahead of Apple's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle focused on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola.\n\n\"The question is who is going to be the first to combine a truly personal AI assistant with knowledge and information that is accurate and personalized,\" said Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst for TECHnalysis Research.\n\nApple has so far shared a timeline for the release of Apple Intelligence only in the United States, where it is slated to launch on compatible devices in the autumn.\n\nIn June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release in Europe due to European Union tech rules.\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco, Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Huawei’s tri-fold phone crosses 3 million pre-orders as Chinese tech giant keeps up pressure on Apple in China",
        "content": "The fortunes of Apple and Huawei have seemingly gone in opposite directions since Huawei unveiled a smartphone featuring an advanced chip in August 2023. Since then, the Chinese tech giant has chipped away at Apple’s market share in China.\n\nThis week, Huawei is looking to upstage Apple again. It’s expected to release the Mate XT, the first commercially produced tri-fold phone, at its product launch event on Sept. 10, 2:30 p.m. Beijing time. That’s just hours after Apple’s own product launch event, where the U.S. tech giant is expected to unveil its latest iPhone equipped with AI applications, along with updates to the Apple watch and Airpods.\n\nHuawei’s head of consumer and automotive technology group Richard Yu posted on Weibo on Monday, teasing the launch of the tri-fold phone. A tri-fold phone is one where the screen can be folded out three times. Besides a new smartphone, Huawei is also expected to unveil new wearables, like its smartwatch, and new tablets.\n\nHuawei started accepting orders for the Mate XT on Sept. 7, and it had already received more than 3 million pre-orders as of time of publication, according to Huawei’s website. The phone officially goes on sale on Sept. 20—the same date that Apple’s new iPhones are expected to be available in stores.\n\nPrices for both Huawei and Apple’s new phones are expected to be announced at their launch events.\n\nTaking market share\n\nHuawei has been gaining market share at the expense of Apple ever since it launched its Mate 60 Pro, a 5G phone featuring a fairly advanced chip, in late August last year. The phone surprised analysts and U.S. officials who had thought export control measures would curtail Chinese tech firms like Huawei from producing such chips at scale.\n\nThat phone was celebrated by state-media in China, and earlier this year Huawei followed up with a new phone, the Pura 70 series, which also features a similarly advanced chip.\n\nAnalysts have speculated that China, which has been barred from procuring cutting edge chipmaking equipment, has optimized older equipment to churn out these more advanced chips. And while it may be more expensive to do that at scale, Huawei’s new phones show Chinese companies may be willing to bear the production costs.\n\nA recent report on the Chinese smartphone market from IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed Huawei in second place with 18.1% of market share in the second quarter of this year—a slice that represented 50.2% year-on-year growth. In contrast, Apple came in sixth. The report noted that despite price promotions, Apple still saw a 3.1% year-on-year decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nData from Counterpoint Research, another market research firm, also showed the recent contrasting fortunes for Apple and Huawei in the Chinese market. Counterpoint’s report had Apple in second place with a market share of 15.5% in the second quarter of 2024, but that’s down 5.7% year-on-year. Huawei had a market share of 15.4% for the same period, which was up 44.5% year-on-year.\n\nApple figures\n\nApple’s own quarterly results for the three months ending June 2024 showed a 6.5% decline in sales year-on-year, to $14.7 billion, in the Greater China market, which includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Measured over the nine-month period ending in June 2024, Apple’s sales in Greater China declined 9.7% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts attribute Apple’s struggles in China at least in part to the increasing rivalry between the U.S. and China. Against the backdrop of Washington’s tighter export control measures, Beijing has been supporting a shift away from Western technology towards domestic ones. And that sentiment may apply to consumer devices as well, with Beijing previously asking government officials to stop using non-Chinese phones for work.\n\nApple’s bid to wrest back market share in China may be further hampered even before its launch due to Beijing’s strict rules around generative AI technology. Such regulations mean the American company’s latest tech offerings in the iPhone 16 won’t be available in China.\n\n“Huawei may still face some production restrictions in its upcoming new launch, but a breakthrough in the form factor will tell the consumers that it’s still the tech leader,” said Will Wong, senior research manager at IDC Asia-Pacific Client Devices Group “This will further strengthen Huawei's brand image, especially since Apple's upcoming AI features will be absent in China in the short term.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 16 on Monday night, with the range set to be the first to include the tech giant’s new AI tools at launch.\n\nDubbed Apple Intelligence by the US firm, the AI features include an upgrade to virtual assistant Siri, image generation and text-editing tools, as well as transcription and other capabilities – with more expected to be announced on Monday.\n\nHowever, questions remain over how much of the technology will immediately be available in Europe because of a regulatory stand-off between Apple and the EU’s new competition rules under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which require rival products and services to more seamlessly function with Apple products.\n\nApple has previously confirmed a delay of some new AI-powered features because of concerns around “interoperability requirements”.\n\nThe features were first previewed during Apple’s developer conference in June, and are expected to begin rolling out for the first time, gradually, as part of the iPhone 16 launch.\n\nIt comes after rivals Google and Samsung both recently launched smartphone ranges with a suite of AI tools built in.\n\nSmartphone expert Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple will need to “carefully explain” when and where its new AI tools will be available.\n\n“As the arms race around AI continues, Apple will likely put a huge focus on Apple Intelligence. That said, we don’t expect all the features unveiled at the WWDC event in June will be available immediately,” he said.\n\n“Furthermore, the company has already stated that Apple Intelligence will not be available in Europe initially due to issues around the EU’s Digital Markets Act. Apple will need to carefully explain what will and won’t work to avoid disappointment from consumers beyond the US.\n\nMore broadly, Mr Wood said “incremental” updates to the iPhone line-up are expected this year.\n\n“Don’t be surprised to see slightly bigger screens, narrower bezels, better battery life, more powerful processors and more,” he said.\n\nThe smartphone expert added that Apple could look to focus the iPhone’s camera technology, and trying to position the new handset as the ultimate photography device.\n\n“Although most changes will be incremental updates compared to last year’s models, we expect Apple to double down on camera technology, photography and video capture,” he said.\n\n“According to CCS Insight’s consumer research, the camera remains one of the most important purchasing decision-making factors for consumers when selecting a new smartphone so it would be little surprise if Apple focuses on this.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Rumours circulating about a new dedicated ‘capture button’ on the side of the phone are interesting as historically Apple has usually tried to remove the number of buttons rather than adding to them.\n\n“However, it could be a way to position the iPhone as ‘offering the best camera experience on a smartphone’ and there could be some additional features such as easy zoom functions that could support this.”\n\nAway from smartphones, the event will likely see new versions of the Apple Watch announced, and there are reports new AirPods – Apple’s wireless earphones – could also be among the products unveiled.",

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM): Among the Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years.\n\nGrowing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn’t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly.\n\nPricing Power Remains Critical, Says Legendary Investor\n\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn’t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.\n\nThe veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers.\n\nForecasts for 2024\n\nWall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched.\n\nMoving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points.\n\nEquity Market Outlook Amidst Uncertain Macro-Economic Environment\n\nA “higher-for-longer” backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.\n\nMarket volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.\n\nIn Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that “there is a risk of disappointment.” The large bank expects that the Fed might stay ‘higher-for-longer,’ US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 156\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest dedicated contract chip manufacturer, or foundry having more than 60% market share. The company makes integrated circuits for customers based on their proprietary IC designs.\n\nThe company enjoys a wide economic moat due to its technological leadership, scale, and reputation. Also, strong brand recognition and high barriers to entry further solidify its competitive advantages. Its economic moat also stems from the cost advantage and intangible assets, which are realized due to its leading position in process technology, or nodes.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) possesses an even larger market share (~90%) of advanced chip manufacturing. This includes 3-nanometer chips, which continue to gain popularity and are becoming standard, and advanced chip packaging for larger components.\n\nWell-renowned names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to make their chips. This is because no other company can provide its capacity or technological expertise.\n\nThe company’s leading position in advanced processes should help it attract and retain more customers, see more stable utilization of production capacities, and lower production costs. Therefore, over the next decade or so, it should generate sufficient profits to finance R&D and capital expenditures on subsequent nodes.\n\nNeedham & Company LLC upped its price target on the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) from $168.00 to $210.00. They gave a “Buy” rating on 15th July.\n\nAriel Investments, an investment management company, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also traded sharply higher in the quarter, following its annual shareholder meeting where management highlighted robust earnings visibility. The boom in AI investment is driving significant demand for the semiconductor hardware that enables it. TSMC currently holds a dominant position in relevant chip manufacturing and packaging. Additionally, although AI investments have been mostly focused on the datacenter market, Apple’s recent announcement on “Apple Intelligence” kickstarted an Edge AI race—which will likely drive greater than expected semiconductor growth in smartphones. TSMC is Apple’s sole foundry partner which bodes well for the future. Overall, we continue to view TSMC’s scale, technology, business model, customer service and execution favorably. The fact the company remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends is another plus.”\n\nOverall TSM ranks 4th on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American tech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\n\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\n\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\n\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\n\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\n\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n% of shares shorted: 0.80%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term leadership in the consumer electronics market by focusing on a high-end, closely connected ecosystem of products, services, and software. Apple's flagship iPhone is the central component of this ecosystem, accounting for 46% of the company’s net sales. Hence, providing it with pricing power, switching costs, and network impact. All other Apple products and services get the most value from keeping users within this walled garden. With this strategy, the company has growth potential and makes it unique.\n\nThe California-based tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal system for its new smartphones, in fiscal Q3 2024, perhaps sparking an iPhone upgrade super cycle. Sales of iPhones reached $39.3 billion YoY, and Mac revenue increased 2% to $7 billion YoY, contributing to the company's $85.8 billion in revenue, a 5% YoY gain. AAPL's economic moat is bolstered by its solid financial history, which includes growth in net income and revenue over the last ten years.\n\nMorningstar analysts upgraded their estimation of the company's fair value from $170 to $185 due to an improvement in their projection for iPhone revenue. Analysts predict strong iPhone-driven growth in 2025 and 2026, pushed by improvements to Apple's artificial intelligence technologies. However, they still believe the firm's stock is expensive, with the present price reflecting an unsustainable 20% iPhone revenue increase in fiscal 2025 amid headwinds in China and slowing upgrade cycles.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\n\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\n\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\n\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\n\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 184\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $93.8 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology firm in the world. It is a global brand and generates 52% of its revenue through the iPhone. This allows Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) a sizeable user base of 1.5 billion users as of 2023, which is its gold mine in the simplest of terms. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s closed ecosystem means that its users have to use the firm's services, and it has used it to create a Services business that generates $78 billion in revenue annually. The user base is also the key to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, as the confidence in its ability to ensure that the users continue to upgrade their iPhones. It has also allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to emerge as a late winner in the AI race. Its shares have lost a mere 1.71% since July, which pales in comparison to MSFT's 11.20% losses. This is because as opposed to MSFT, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is perceived to be in a better position to monetize AI due to its consumer focused business as opposed to the former's enterprise focused model.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: What I imagined foldables would be like",
        "content": "Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel 9 Pro Fold is here, and the company has a lot to be proud of when it comes to its second-generation foldable smartphone. Well, except for its clumsy name.\n\nFrom its book-like shape and battery life to its cameras, the Pixel Fold is a top-tier smartphone for anyone interested in diving into the world of foldables. But it’s not perfect.\n\nStarting at $1,899, the Pixel Fold is an expensive proposition right up there with Samsung’s similarly designed Galaxy Z Fold 6. That's a heck of a lot more than Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 15 Pro Max, which starts at $1,199, and Samsung’s top-of-the-line non-folding Galaxy S24 Ultra, which costs $1,299.\n\nPrice is a big reason foldables are still niche products compared to standard smartphones. But they have a lot to offer if you're willing to pony up for them, especially the Pixel Fold. In fact, this is easily one of my favorite foldables and the best book-like foldable I’ve used.\n\nSamsung’s clamshell-like Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still one of the most stylish foldables thanks to the fact that it folds like an old-school flip phone. There’s just something about snapping a phone shut when you hang up on someone that makes you feel like a high-powered '90s executive. But I digress.\n\nI’ve been propping up the Pixel Fold on my treadmill’s magazine holder so that I can watch the Mets on its big center display while exercising. And on Thursday, I was able to track my fantasy football teams by running the Yahoo Fantasy Sports and ESPN Fantasy Sports apps side by side on the Fold’s inner screen. Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a foldable 8-inch screen. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nWhile that middle display is certainly useful, it’s not something I’d use every day. In fact, the single biggest reason I prefer the Pixel Fold over Samsung’s rival Z Fold 6 comes down to their cover screens.\n\nThe Pixel Fold has a 6.3-inch front display that’s similar to a standard smartphone, while the Z Fold 6 has a 6.3-inch cover screen that’s just a hair too thin, which makes typing on the keyboard with my chunkier digits feel cramped. My wife, whose fingers are more slender than mine, however, doesn’t have any trouble typing on the Samsung display.\n\nThe Pixel Fold’s inner display is also a bit larger than the Samsug’s foldable screen — 8 inches compared to 7.6 inches — providing a larger canvas to stream shows and multitask. That’s not to say you can’t do the same on the Z Fold 6, but even a smidge more screen real estate makes it easier to read text while using two apps.\n\nOn the camera front, the Pixel Fold gets wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle lenses and a 5x telephoto lens. Samsung’s Z Fold 6 offers a similar camera setup, though it packs a 3x optical zoom. Photos taken with both phones are fantastic thanks to their advanced sensors and capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the Pixel Fold’s performance and power, apps ran without any hiccups, and the battery lasted well throughout the day and then some.\n\nBut the Pixel Fold isn’t flawless. Its speakers aren’t very loud, so if you like using your phone to listen to music out loud, you’ll be left wanting. I use a white noise app to go to sleep at night, and I could hardly hear the sound of the faux box fan thanks to the Pixel Fold’s lackadaisical speakers. In the end, I had to use a secondary phone to play the app’s audio.\n\nGoogle has also positioned the Pixel Fold’s inner selfie camera on the far right top corner of the phone, which makes keeping yourself centered while video chatting via the inner display needlessly difficult. Sure, you can use the front selfie camera (yes, there are two separate selfie cameras) to video chat with friends, but why have that giant foldable screen if you’re not going to use it? Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still one of the freshest looking foldables. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nGoogle, like Samsung, has also poured a slew of generative AI features into the Pixel Fold. The AI-powered Pixel Screenshots app is helpful in that it allows you to take screenshots and quickly pull useful information from them by searching for the info you need. For instance, if you see an ad for an upcoming concert, you can screenshot it, and then when you want to remember what day the show is, you can search for the name of the band in the Screenshots app and it’ll give you the info you’re looking for.\n\nGoogle also loads its Gemini assistant onto the Pixel Fold, which provides advanced search and conversation capabilities. But as with other smartphones, I haven’t found much use for the majority of the Pixel Fold’s AI features in my day-to-day life.\n\nThere’s also a Pixel Studio app for making AI-generated art and a generative AI-enhanced weather app that doesn’t add much to the overall experience. In fact, the so-called “AI Weather Report” feels like it takes longer to read than simply looking up the temperature and current conditions.\n\nFor now, at least, it feels like Google is throwing everything AI-related at the wall to see what sticks. There are certainly some smart ideas here, especially with the Pixel Screenshots app, but I’m not sold on things like the Pixel Fold’s Reimagine feature, which is available through its Magic Editor camera app. The software lets you completely change your photo using generative AI.\n\nThe idea is that you can make it appear as though you and your friends were standing in a field of flowers when you took a photo rather than in a Target parking lot. I’m sure it’s fun to play with the feature for the first few days after you get your phone, but I don’t see it as something I’d use every day or week.\n\nBut that’s not why you’d buy a phone like the Pixel Fold. You’re likely considering this phone for its unique design and foldable capabilities. And if that’s the case, and you don’t mind spending an extra chunk of change to get those features, you can’t go wrong with Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Wall Street veteran Alex Green issues warning to Americans who invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks",
        "content": "Wall Street veteran Alex Green issues warning to Americans who invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks\n\nFor many investors, stocks that pay dividends represent the height of reliability. Just witness the track records of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and its main competitor PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP): Both rank among the 53 “dividend kings” that have increased shareholder payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nYet the question remains whether paying dividends is really the most resourceful option.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n\"There are some companies that are growing so rapidly that the best use of their cash is not to pay dividends to shareholders or even to buy back their own shares, but to reinvest in their own operations” said The Oxford Club’s Chief Investment Strategist Alex Green in a recent interview with finance YouTuber Ari Gutman.\n\nMarket giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have opted over time for the latter. That sets the stage for more growth, which can in turn lead to higher share prices.\n\nGreen recalled a time more than 24 years ago when he worked on Wall Street and advised a client to buy shares in billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). The client, who was retired, took a pass because they wanted some steady income and the company didn't pay out dividends. (It still doesn't.)\n\n\"Think how well he would have done if he'd have bought those shares of Berkshire and just sold a little bit off each year if he needed some income,\" Green said. “That’s what everyone needs is return, not income.”\n\nWe did the math and since the year 2000, the stock has soared by more than 1,200%.\n\nHow dividends work — and sometimes fall short\n\nA dividend is a shareholder payout companies make, usually on a quarterly basis, based on their profits. Many investors like them because it can act as a steady source of income.\n\nFor example, sitting atop the “dividend kings” utilities sector you’ll find two businesses that have upped their dividend growth for 69 consecutive years: American States Water (NYSE:AWR) and Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN). This is as ranked by Simply Safe Dividends whose tagline says it all: \"We're boring and conservative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet as Green’s too-careful client learned the hard way, boring and conservative can be humbling and costly. Consider the aforementioned Amazon, a high-flying company whose stock is doing better now than it has over the last two years. Since last year, the stock is up by more than 100%.\n\nOut of 65 analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, 54 call it a \"buy.\" And it has never offered a dividend. Compare that to American States Water, whose stock has lowered over the same period.\n\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nSkepticism over dividend-centered investing is nothing new. But it’s not that dividend stocks are bad bets in and of themselves; rather, they can be part of a balanced portfolio that could include even more conservative investments such as bonds and riskier ones such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, tech-sector companies that famously resisted dividends have gotten into the game. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started paying out dividends in 2012, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gave out its first-ever dividends in June 2024.\n\nJust a few months prior, Meta (NASDAQ:META) announced its first dividend effective Feb. 22. In each case, the dividend marked a point where the companies had matured past their go-go stages and had plenty of money to sit on. All three today boast market caps measured in trillions of dollars.\n\nGreen urged investors to think of stocks not just in terms of dividends, which many treat as income, but total returns. If a stock skyrockets, its share price will far outpace even the biggest dividend; in the S&P 500, that's offered by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).\n\n“I have nothing against dividend investing,” he said. “A lot of smart people are dividend oriented and there are a lot of great dividend-paying stocks out there. But I just would warn people not to invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks.”\n\nWhat to read next\n\nUnlock access to 4,700+ hand-picked, single-family homes across America — and the juicy rental cash they can generate.

        "content": "The S&P 500 just suffered its worst week since the 2023 regional banking scare as a mixed August jobs report failed to reinvigorate investor appetite.\n\nIn the holiday-shortened trading week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 4% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled nearly 6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 3%. The first week of September also marked the worst weekly return for the Nasdaq 100 since 2022, led by a more than 12% decline in Nvidia stock (NVDA).\n\nA fresh reading on inflation will headline the week ahead as investors continue to look for clues on how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. Additionally, the first reading of consumer sentiment for September is slated for release on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, Apple's annual iPhone event kicks off the week on Monday. Earnings results from Oracle (ORCL), Adobe (ADBE), and Kroger (KR) will lead an otherwise quiet week in scheduled company announcements.\n\n'No clear winner' from the jobs report\n\nThe August jobs report showed the US economy added 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. Revisions to the June and July labor reports showed the US economy added 86,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in those months.\n\nCapital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown wrote in a note to clients Friday that given the report wasn't overly strong or exceedingly weak, it \"did not signal a clear winner\" in the debate over whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\nSpeeches from Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed president John Williams appeared to tilt the markets in favor of a 25 basis point cut.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 25% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point cut in September, down from a 40% chance seen the day prior, per the CME Fed Watch tool.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs economics team led by Jan Hatzius reasoned Friday's Fed speak was consistent with Goldman's forecast for a 25 basis point cut in September but indicates \"that the Fed leadership is open to 50bp cuts at subsequent meetings if the labor market continues to deteriorate.\"\n\nPrice check\n\nWhile signs of slowing in the labor market have been top of mind for market participants over the past few weeks, inflation remains a key piece of when and how aggressively the Fed will cut rates. Wednesday will bring the final inflation reading before the Fed's next policy decision on Sep. 18 with the release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects an annual gain of 2.6% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, down from the 2.9% seen in July. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, in line with their monthly increase from July.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.2% year over year, unchanged from the prior month. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%, also unchanged from the prior month.\n\n\"Another benign CPI report could give enough FOMC members further 'confidence' that inflation is moving back to 2% on a sustainable basis for them to back a 50 bps rate cut,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"If, on the other hand, the inflation data are hotter than expected, then the consensus likely will coalesce around a 25 bps reduction on Sept. 18.\"\n\niPhone intro\n\nThe top company release of the week will come on Monday when Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone event. The event is expected to provide more details on Apple's Apple Intelligence AI platform.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the full preview.

        "title": "40.5% of Warren Buffett's $312 Billion Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is in These 2 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Under the leadership of CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway has paid a dividend to its investors just once (a $0.10 per share payout back in 1967). Instead, the company chooses to use its capital to invest in its wholly owned businesses and other companies, make new acquisitions, buy Treasury bonds, and buy back its own shares.\n\nWith Berkshire's stock up more than 3,976,400% since Buffett purchased a controlling stake in the company in 1965, it's hard to argue with the Oracle of Omaha's capital-allocation strategy. The stock's gains across the stretch would have turned a $1,000 investment into more than $42.5 million today.\n\nEven though Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend itself, Buffett is a big fan of companies that return cash to shareholders through direct payouts. In fact, each of the company's 10 largest stock holdings pays a dividend -- and its portfolio is heavily weighted toward just a handful of dividend-paying stocks. Read on for a look at the two dividend stocks that account for 40.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's $312 billion stock portfolio.\n\nA lot more than the dividend\n\nJennifer Saibil:Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was recently inducted into Buffett's hallowed trio of stocks he said he'd never sell. As it turns out, he meant that he'd never sell the full position because he sold some Apple stock immediately after he said it.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's fallen out of Buffett's favor. It still accounts for roughly 28.3% of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\n\nLike the other Buffett forever holdings, Apple is a dividend stock. It doesn't have a high yield -- just 0.45% at the current price, or well below the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. That's close to its lowest-ever yield, which is partially because Apple stock has been outstanding this year, gaining almost 15% year to date.\n\nThe dividend demonstrates several things that are important to Buffett, regardless of the yield. It's a tangible sign of Apple's commitment to creating shareholder value and means management is prioritizing its cash position, which is paramount to operating a viable and growing business. Apple has a low payout ratio of only 14.9% because it's still in a robust growth mode and uses most of its earnings for innovation and operations.\n\nApple has the global brand name and moat that Buffett loves, and being able to support that is a key element of sustaining its lead and edge. Apple fans are known to stick with the company's platform, trading up for new models when they're released. They're loyal to the Apple ecosystem, which is differentiated through its innovation, operating system, ease of use, and general excellence. Buffett said that Apple is an even better business than his other forever stocks, Coca-Cola and American Express (NYSE: AXP).\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's not surprising that Apple is beating the market this year or is back in the top spot as the most valuable company on the stock market. It's exciting investors with its advancement in artificial intelligence, and the newest iteration of the iPhone is expected to be released this month. Even though it's already minted plenty of millionaires, there's a lot more to expect from Apple stock.\n\nAmerican Express is now Buffett's second-biggest bet\n\nKeith Noonan: Following some significant portfolio reshuffling in the second quarter, American Express overtook Bank of America to become Berkshire's second-largest overall stock holding. The Oracle of Omaha's company owns more than 151.6 million shares of AmEx stock, and the position accounts for 12.2% of its total stock holdings.\n\nThe credit card-focused banking company has been serving up strong financial results, and its share price has risen roughly 58% over the last year. These big gains have also pushed down the company's dividend yield. That's not a problem for Berkshire because the company acquired the bulk of its AmEx shares at much lower prices, but is the stock still worthwhile for other income-seeking investors at today's prices?\n\nWhile the company's current yield of roughly 1% may not look like much, there's a good chance that shares purchased today will boast a much bigger yield down the line. American Express has increased its dividend payout by roughly 63% over the last three years and hasn't been letting up on the gas pedal when it comes to payout growth.\n\nWith the payout increase it announced back in March, American Express hiked its dividend by 17%. Strong financial performance has paved the way for big payout growth, and there are good reasons to expect that profit expansion will continue to facilitate rapid dividend growth.\n\nAmerican Express's revenue increased 8% year over year in the second quarter, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share rose 21%, compared to the prior-year period. The company added 3.3 million new card accounts in the quarter and recorded its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit annual growth for card fees. For the full-year period, the company expects that it will grow sales between 9% and 11%, and its midpoint guidance calls for earnings growth of roughly 21%.\n\nThe American Express brand and its financial products have continued to gain favor. And thanks to its focus on attracting a high-credit-quality customer base, the company also has the benefit of credit default rates that are best in class. While the stock's yield comes in below the S&P 500 index's average, it still looks like a worthwhile investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Leading the Pack Among the Best ESG Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other ESG stocks.\n\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\n\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\n“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”\n\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\n\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 25 Most Powerful Brands in the US\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 7.32%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an obvious choice for ESG investors, given its strong commitment to labor rights, environmental responsibility, and ethical business practices across its supply chain. The tech giant has reduced its overall greenhouse gas emissions by over 55% since 2015, marking significant progress toward its ambitious Apple 2030 goal of achieving carbon neutrality across its entire value chain by the decade’s end.\n\nOn the business front, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to demonstrate robust financial performance and growth potential, solidifying its leading position in the technology market. For fiscal Q3, the company reported revenue of $85.8 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, surpassing analyst expectations of $84.5 billion. Earnings per share also rose by 11% to $1.40, exceeding the anticipated $1.35.\n\nOn August 2, Goldman Sachs raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $265 to $275 while maintaining a Buy rating. The firm highlighted Apple’s strong performance in the iPhone segment and sustained momentum in its services business. Goldman Sachs anticipates a significant multi-year iPhone replacement cycle, bolstering its confidence in Apple’s future growth.\n\nOn the other hand, MoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Neutral rating and a $211 price target. Although the firm acknowledged Apple’s strong AI strategy, the analysts also noted that the market has already priced in these developments. MoffettNathanson emphasized that while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-positioned to lead in AI, its advantage lies in the trust of over one billion users, particularly concerning personal data like contacts and emails, which Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) keeps securely under its control.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Invested $2.9 Billion in His Favorite Stock This Year (Hint: Not Apple)",
        "content": "In 1962, Warren Buffett began buying stock in a textile manufacturing company called Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). In 1965, he assumed control of the New England operation and began using it as a holding company to acquire other businesses and buy stocks.\n\nUnder his leadership, Berkshire shares have returned 20% annually for nearly six decades, roughly doubling the gains in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Meanwhile, Buffett has amassed a personal fortune of $150 billion. Those accomplishments make him one of the best investors in American history.\n\nToday, Buffett reportedly manages about 90% of Berkshire's stock portfolio, including the largest positions, while fellow investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler handle the rest. Buffett can also repurchase Berkshire stock when he believes it trades at a discount to its intrinsic value.\n\nWith that in mind, Buffett made two important capital allocation decisions in the first half of 2024:\n\nHe sold 505 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), slashing Berkshire's stake by more than 50%. He repurchased $2.9 billion in Berkshire stock, meaning shares were undervalued in his estimation.\n\nImportantly, Buffett has repurchased Berkshire stock every quarter for six consecutive years, spending a cumulative total of $78 billion on buybacks during that period. He also has 99% of his net worth invested in the company -- I am not talking about Berkshire's portfolio but rather Buffett's personal wealth. That makes a compelling case for Berkshire being his favorite stock.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Apple and Berkshire.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple has cultivated brand authority by pairing appealing hardware with proprietary software to create a user experience for which consumers willingly pay a premium. The average iPhone costs more than twice as much as the average Android smartphone, and Apple dominates the smartphone market in terms of revenue share. It is also the market leader in digital tablets and smartwatches outside of China and the fourth-largest personal computer manufacturer by shipment volume.\n\nHowever, the Apple innovation engine seems to be losing momentum. The company introduced the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch over a nine-year period that ended in 2015, but Apple has not launched a new viral product since AirPods hit the market in 2017. Furthermore, iPhones account for about 45% of total revenue, but iPhone sales have yet to top the record $71.6 billion from the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn short, Apple's long-term growth prospects in hardware are less than compelling, even though many analysts expect a massive upgrade cycle following the launch of Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for iPhones and MacBooks expected in October. That means future revenue growth heavily depends on services like advertising, Apple Pay, the App Store, and iCloud storage.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, services account for less than 30% of total revenue, so that segment can only move the needle slowly. That's a problem because Apple stock is priced for robust growth. Shares currently trade at 33.6 times earnings. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects earnings to increase at 8.6% annually over the next three years. Those figures give a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of 3.9, a significant premium to the three-year average of 2.6. At that price, Apple looks overvalued.\n\nPersonally, I would avoid this stock, and (like Buffett) I would consider trimming my position if I were sitting on profits.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the largest insurance company in the world as measured by float, a term referring to money an insurer holds between the time customers pay premiums and make claims. Due to disciplined underwriting, Berkshire has paid less than nothing to accumulate float, and Warren Buffett has invested those funds very effectively.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had over $250 billion in fixed-income securities (bonds and Treasury bills), $285 billion in equity securities (stocks), and $40 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of the quarter ending in June. The sum of those invested assets has climbed steadily higher. In fact, Berkshire's book value per share -- a good yardstick for changes in intrinsic value -- increased at 11.3% annually over the last decade, outpacing the annual gain of 10.8% in the S&P 500.\n\nBuffett has also used insurance float to purchase dozens of subsidiaries that span the gamut of the U.S. economy, from energy and utilities to manufacturing and retail. Berkshire even owns freight railway Burlington North Santa Fe, which occupies a critical link in the domestic supply chain. Importantly, because those subsidiaries were generally vetted by Buffett, we can assume they met his standards for having a durable economic moat.\n\nThat means Berkshire is a collection of above-average businesses that operate across a diverse range of industries. Those qualities make the company resilient during economic downturns. Since 1980, Berkshire stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a median of 4.4 percentage points during recessions, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nWall Street expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings (which excludes investment gains and losses) at 18% annually through 2027. That estimate makes the current valuation of 23.5 times operating earnings look reasonable. Investors, especially those worried about an economic downturn in the near future, should consider buying a small position in this stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing. Money is just not talked about. Frankly, it’s become the third rail of American education. You’re a thousand times more likely to read Marx’s “Das Kapital” than to read anything about planning a budget or picking stocks.”\n\nCramer’s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\n“That’s why I’m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you’re going to stop working—hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I’m betting most of you, even if you don’t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\n\nDecades ago, corporate pensions started going the way of the dodo, and now the 401(k) is the main way that Americans save for retirement. They’re offered by your employer, and they’re among the greatest tax-deferred investment vehicles out there, along with the IRA. And I’m not talking about the Irish Republican Army—I’m not even talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, for that matter. I mean the Individual Retirement Account.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it’s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\n“Hear me out, darn it—you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there’s a lot the so-called experts don’t tell you or don’t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)—you’d have to be a fool not to contribute.\n\nMany experts will even advise you to max out your 401(k) contributions every year if you can afford to. Right now, the maximum contribution is over 20 grand, with room for an additional 7 grand if you’re over 50. It tends to rise gradually over time, usually a little faster than inflation. In 2004, it was $13,000; by 2023, it was $22,500. Either way, that’s a serious chunk of change, even with these contributions coming from your pre-tax income.”\n\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\n“However, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I’m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it’s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns—sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I’ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)—maybe there’s a better way for you to invest for retirement.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nMarket Capitalization: 3.38T\n\nJim Cramer explains that while some experts argue that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock appears expensive, this perspective overlooks the company’s strong cash flow, which supports its value. Cramer highlights a recent insightful piece by Ben Rice from Melius, which argues that despite the market’s current overbought conditions, investors should hold onto their Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.\n\n“Another firm mentioned that Apple’s stock is expensive, which it is—unless you consider the cash flow instead of just the earnings. The piece by the irrepressible Ben Rice from Melius made so much sense that you know you need to hold on tight and not feel compelled to sell your Apple stock when the market gets overbought, as it is now. The tech titans, the hyperscalers, the colossal portion of the market—yes, the mega stocks—they just come back every time you sell. But short-term signals say to sell. To me, that means it’s time to bunker down and accept the unavoidable small losses. These stocks are just too good to let go. Bottom line: Hold on to them.”\n\nIn Q3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenues of $85.78 billion, marking a 5% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven primarily by a 14% rise in services revenue, which reached an all-time high of $24.21 billion. Key services like iCloud, Apple Music, and the App Store have become significant contributors to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s financial success, demonstrating its ability to perform well even amid economic challenges. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s net income also grew nearly 8% year-over-year to $21.45 billion, with earnings per share rising to $1.40, exceeding analysts’ expectations.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s investment in artificial intelligence, especially with the launch of the new Apple Intelligence platform, is set to bolster future growth by enhancing user experiences across its ecosystem. Although iPhone sales experienced a slight decline and sales in Greater China fell by over 6%, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s focus on expanding its services and AI capabilities provides a solid growth outlook.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B): ‘Wait Until It Comes Down And Buy Some More’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks You Should Check Out.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer thinks you should check out.\n\nJim Cramer draws an engaging parallel between fantasy football and stock investing as the NFL season begins. Cramer uses this occasion to introduce his concept of \"Fantasy Stock Football.\" He likens selecting stocks for an investment portfolio to drafting players for a fantasy football team, emphasizing how both require strategic thinking and role balancing.\n\n\"While you're enjoying the game, I want to get you into the NFL spirit with some Fantasy Stock Football.\"\n\nUnveiling Jim Cramer's \"Fantasy Stock Football\" Strategy\n\nCramer enjoys blending real-world sports with market insights to offer a unique perspective on investing. He notes that, like fantasy football teams, investment portfolios consist of various stocks that play different roles, contributing to overall performance. Reflecting on the previous year, he highlights that the 11 stocks he recommended have risen an average of 38%, outperforming the S&P 500’s 23% gain. This comparison underscores his belief in the strategic approach to both fantasy football and stock selection.\n\n\"Now look, I love comparing real teams and real players to my favorite stocks. These are two great tastes that taste great together. More importantly, it gives me another angle to help you—I’ve got to teach you about the market in any way I can. Picking stocks for your portfolio has a lot in common with drafting players for your fantasy football team.\n\nFifty-five million people do it. Different positions play different roles for your fantasy team, just like different stocks fill different roles in your portfolio. By the way, if you look at the 11 stocks I highlighted when we did this a year ago, they’re now up an average of 38%, compared to the S&P 500, which is up 23% during the same period.\"\n\nCramer's Warning Against Overreacting to Market Fluctuations\n\nJim Cramer highlights some key mistakes investors are making and emphasizes the importance of a strategic approach to investing. He points out that many investors are making errors by overreacting to market fluctuations and trying to time their moves poorly. According to Cramer, sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing and avoid making rash decisions.\n\n\"People keep making a ton of mistakes when they should really just be sitting on their hands. Sometimes the best thing you can do is absolutely nothing. Instead, they're acting out every possible fantasy nightmare when it comes to the market. Not only is it tedious and foolhardy, but it’s also very expensive for anyone who's running with this non-strategy. You can see the averages, which started out like a house on fire today, only to fizzle out by the end.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer: Trust Powell’s Strategy Amid Economic Data Volatility\n\nCramer criticizes the persistent doubts about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He believes Powell has managed the transition from tightening to easing policies well, despite earlier criticism for slow rate hikes. The ongoing panic over economic data—whether strong or weak—shows a lack of faith in Powell’s ability to adjust rates appropriately. Cramer asserts that the Fed will act as needed, whether that means a 25 or 50 basis point cut, and advises investors to trust Powell’s strategy rather than being swayed by market noise.\n\n\"There’s a belief that the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell will somehow screw up the transition as they shift from tightening to stop inflation to easing to combat recession. At this point in Powell’s tenure, I find it insane that he never seems to get the benefit of the doubt. Well, yes, he started raising rates a little too late in 2022, but it’s hard to blame him for that. Powell didn’t want to hit the brakes on the economy when we were still dealing with a healthcare emergency, which is why he didn’t tighten in 2021.\n\nWho would have thought that COVID would run its course so quickly? Who could have imagined that the Biden administration would be able to pass generous spending packages right when we stopped needing them, sparking an inflationary run? Since then, though Jerome Powell has done pretty much everything right. Once rolling, he raised rates with vigor because our country had some of the worst inflation in recent history.\n\nThe rate hikes, one after another, did manage to tamp down inflation. Everything that could be controlled by the Fed is now going the right way. Prices have come down all over the place, though many are still elevated compared to 2019 levels. But I don’t think anyone surveying the situation could honestly contend that Powell is going in the wrong direction...\n\nWhat’s most important, though, is that if you have faith in Jerome Powell, as I do, you know he'll give us a 25 basis point cut if that’s what’s needed. And if the economy suddenly gets weaker, then a 50 basis point cut would be on the table. Why is that so hard to understand? People keep freaking out about things that simply won’t be a problem, given that we have a competent central bank. They’ve done this during the run-up to every Fed easing cycle I can recall. You always get these tense moments—like right now—filled with wild swings, full of sound and fury, and of course, yes, signifying nothing.\"\n\nJim Cramer Defends AI, Calls Early Criticisms Misguided\n\nCramer addresses skepticism around artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it is premature to dismiss its potential. While current AI developments may not seem revolutionary, he believes that significant advancements, such as breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, indicate that AI’s impact will grow over time.\n\n\"We’ve gone from a world where artificial intelligence (AI) was supposed to solve everything to a world where AI is treated as just a robust sham, except for when ServiceNow gets one more contract, of course. At its apex, AI was supposed to make organizations much more efficient, improve gross margins magically, and create inventions vastly better than the status quo. Sadly, we don’t see much of anything tangible, other than competing chatbots—rivaling inquiry systems that can generate information in sentence form, including hallucinations. We’re told the whole thing’s a canard, and this reality has slapped true believers like me in the face.\"\n\nJim Cramer believes that dismissing AI as a failure is premature. He argues that people are underestimating its potential, as we are still early in discovering its practical applications. According to Cramer, recent advances in accelerated computing and generative AI have already led to significant breakthroughs, such as improvements in cancer diagnosis. While the excitement around AI in healthcare may suggest we're on the brink of a major revolution, Cramer points out that we're actually witnessing a gradual but important evolution in the technology's capabilities.\n\n\"Now look, I think that’s just plain wrong. It’s way too early to view AI as a waste. People know nothing. We’re only a couple of years into finding use cases, for heaven’s sake. We just got word that accelerated computing and generative AI have led to a breakthrough in cancer diagnosis, which could be very important. That’s a huge thing. But the hype of what this technology could mean for healthcare seems to illustrate that we aren’t seeing a revolution yet—we’re just seeing a faster evolution.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended various stocks. It highlights ten companies that Cramer featured and explores their perception among hedge funds. The companies are ranked from the least owned to the most owned by hedge funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 120\n\nJim Cramer advises that there’s never a bad time to buy Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). He suggests purchasing some shares now and then waiting for the stock price to drop before buying more. Cramer believes Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is an excellent investment and recommends taking advantage of any opportunity to add to one’s portfolio.\n\n\"When is it a bad time to buy Berkshire? Buy some tomorrow. I think it’s terrific. Then, wait until it comes down and buy some more.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands out as a strong investment due to its diverse portfolio, excellent financial performance, and dependable leadership under Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), which includes major businesses like GEICO, BNSF Railways, and significant stakes in giants such as Apple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL), has shown impressive results.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Berkshire earned $35.9 billion, up from $28.9 billion the previous year, and its operating income grew by 6.6%, thanks to improvements in insurance and energy sectors. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) ’s cash reserves have increased to nearly $150 billion, giving it the flexibility to invest or acquire new assets. Recent moves, such as boosting its stake in Occidental Petroleum and reducing its position in Bank of America Corporation\n\n(NYSE:BAC), reflect Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)'s strategic approach and confidence in the energy sector. With its strong financial health, broad range of businesses, and Buffett’s steady leadership, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is well-positioned for ongoing growth and stability, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOverall BRK-B ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer thinks you should check out. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "There's No Denying It; Nvidia Is on a Historic Run, but Here Are 2 Tech Stocks I'd Buy Instead",
        "content": "There isn't a stock on the market that has been talked about more in the past two years than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has made Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) one of the most sought-after products because of their role in training AI.\n\nIt has also made Nvidia one of the hottest stocks on the market. From September 2022 to the start of September 2024, its stock rose over 750% -- 18 times more than the S&P 500's gains over that span. That's not an easy feat for a company whose market cap was around $300 million at the time.\n\nNvidia has also posted financial results to back this hype, increasing revenue and operating income by 122% and 174%, respectively. The praise is well deserved. That said, there are two companies that I'd be more likely to invest in at this point because there seems to be more long-term certainty around their businesses.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) is one of the world's most-important tech companies despite not being a household name like some other big tech companies. It operates the world's largest semiconductor (chip) foundry, manufacturing chips for companies' specific needs.\n\nCompanies come to TSMC with a chip design, and it produces the chip according to the company's request. It may seem simple enough, but manufacturing chips with that level of precision and at that scale requires complex processes (putting it lightly) and advanced technology that no other company has been able to match.\n\nOne company that relies heavily on TSMC is Nvidia. TSMC manufactures Nvidia's chips for its GPUs, data-center processors, and other AI-related chips. Without TSMC's manufacturing capabilities, there's a strong case that Nvidia's products would take a quality hit. That's largely why Nvidia hasn't embraced other chip manufacturers and is comfortable relying on TSMC.\n\nNvidia's dependence on TSMC is why I prefer it at this stage. Much of Nvidia's high valuation is built on expectations of what it should become, and its ability to deliver on that will depend on TSMC's production capacity. The ceiling may not be nearly as high for TSMC, but its trajectory is seemingly more reliable.\n\nTSMC also has an attractive dividend that reduces some of the investing risk. Its dividend yield is currently above the S&P 500's average, making it easier for investors to remain patient during rocky times and trust its long-term potential.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) didn't reach the point of being the world's most valuable public company by mistake; it has taken decades of non-complacency and disciplined execution. With Apple's track record of discipline, it was puzzling why so many Wall Street investors were seemingly shocked as Apple remained relatively quiet during recent AI mania.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has a history of letting other companies create something and then venturing into that area with a much better design and making it more user friendly. We've seen it with smartphones (iPhone), tablets (iPad), smartwatches (Apple Watch), virtual reality (Apple Vision Pro), and handfuls of other tech hardware.\n\nOf course, Apple isn't just going around copying others; rather, the tech giant does a great job of letting others be the guinea pigs and then learning perhaps from their missteps before releasing its own products and services to the market. That seems to be the same approach it's taking with AI, too.\n\nApple hasn't rushed into AI like most other big tech companies. In fact, it doesn't even refer to its coming AI capabilities as \"artificial intelligence\"; it's \"Apple Intelligence.\" (It's just clever enough to work.) Nvidia is in a volatile position; just as fast as it rose, it can fall if it fails to meet expectations. Apple doesn't quite have that same risk, though it's not exempt from volatility. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nIdeally, Apple Intelligence will give Apple an immediate financial boost, with consumers rushing to buy its next-gen products since it'll only be accessible on newer hardware models. After a slump in Apple's smartphone market over the past few years, I'm sure the company wouldn't mind an extra lift from somewhere.\n\nShort-term boost aside, there aren't too many companies I trust more long term than Apple.

        "title": "Do Analysts Remain Bullish on Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Starter Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\n\nThe Market Outlook for the Rest of 2024\n\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an interview on CNBC. Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\n\nThe Possible Impact of Rate Cuts on Stocks\n\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\n\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor’s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 safe stocks to invest in now, we looked for well-established companies in the energy, finance, healthcare, technology, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. These stocks have a history of performing well and boasting consistent financial results, making them ideal and safe long term investments for beginners. We then picked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by money managers and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 25 Most Powerful Brands in the US\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the safest stocks to invest in. Apple is the company behind the iPhone, used by a vast majority across the globe, accounting for 46% of the company’s net sales. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models and Apple is on the cusp of an iPhone upgrade super cycle. The new feature aims to dramatically enhance a user’s experience across all Apple devices.\n\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple’s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 12% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall APPL ranks 4th among the safe stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of APPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Stock",
        "content": "It wasn't all that long ago that investors wondered which stock would be the first to reach a market cap of $1 trillion. Today, seven stocks have market caps of at least $1 trillion, with a couple more knocking on the door.\n\nBut the bar has been raised. A $1 trillion market cap is ho-hum now. Which stock will be Wall Street's first $5 trillion stock? Here's my prediction.\n\nSeveral worthy contenders\n\nI think there are several worthy contenders to become the first member of the $5 trillion club. And they share a common denominator: leadership in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMicrosoft emerged as an AI superstar after teaming up with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant could have a clear path to reaching a $5 trillion market cap if organizations continue flocking to the cloud to build and deploy generative AI applications.\n\nNo company has dominated the AI scene like Nvidia, though. The demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been jaw-dropping, as customers bought them hand over fist to power their AI models. Don't let the recent pullback for this stock fool you: Nvidia could soon return to its winning ways.\n\nSome might view Google parent Alphabet as an underdog in the race to $5 trillion. Antitrust regulators are going after the company for its market dominance in digital advertising. However, I wouldn't underestimate Alphabet. It's been an AI pioneer for years and has an especially big growth opportunity with its Waymo self-driving car unit.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon is one of the first to crack the $5 trillion level. Like Microsoft and Google, it's a leader in cloud services (actually, Amazon Web Services is the top market leader in this space). The company is also continually expanding into new arenas, with its planned launch of a satellite internet business the latest example.\n\nMy $5 trillion pick\n\nHowever, as much as I like Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon, I don't think any of them will be the first to attain a market cap of $5 trillion. Instead, I predict Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will get there first.\n\nIt certainly helps that Apple has a head start over the other contenders. The company's market cap already tops $3.3 trillion. If Apple's share price increases by a compound annual growth rate of 9% over the next five years, it will blow past the $5 trillion level.\n\nYou'll sometimes hear that in football, the best offense is a strong defense. I think that can be true in business, too. Apple has an exceptionally strong \"defense\" with its highly loyal customer base and sticky ecosystem of products and services. This should help keep the company's market cap from sliding lower and allow innovations to drive growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat innovations from Apple are on the way? The most obvious one is Apple Intelligence, the company's first generative AI functionality. Some Wall Street analysts believe that the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence will ignite a new iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nI think we'll see more from Apple on the augmented reality front, too -- and not just with its Apple Vision mixed-reality headsets. Also, 6G wireless networks could be available by 2030, enabling cool new capabilities such as viewing holographic images on your iPhones. Just the anticipation of this could push Apple above the $5 trillion market later this decade.\n\nI could be wrong\n\nI'll be the first to admit that my prediction could be dead wrong. Maybe I'm counting too heavily on Apple's innovations to fuel growth. However, I suspect if I am wrong about Apple becoming the first $5 trillion stock, it will be because one of the other stocks I mentioned reaches the level sooner.\n\nIt's easy for me to envision many scenarios where another stock beats Apple to a $5 trillion market cap. Perhaps artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved, with Nvidia's GPUs becoming more critical than they are now. A major breakthrough in quantum computing could be made by Alphabet, Amazon, or Microsoft. Some other development could come out of left field from a company I haven't mentioned that is a head-spinning game changer.\n\nHowever, based on how things stand right now, I think Apple has the best shot at reaching a market cap of $5 trillion first. Even if I'm wrong, the stock should be a solid winner for investors over the next decade and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock Headed to $4 Trillion Over the Coming 12 to 18 Months, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) early last year, the star of the show has been Nvidia. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard for AI training and inference applications. This, in turn, has resulted in a blistering run for the stock, which has gained 639% (as of this writing) since early last year. As a result, Nvidia's market cap has grown by leaps and bounds, currently valued at $2.6 trillion.\n\nYet concerns about the growing threat of competition and Nvidia's premium valuation have some investors looking for other ways to profit from AI -- and they don't have to look far. One company is about to get swept up by the tailwinds of AI, driving its market cap to more than $4 trillion over the coming year or so -- iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe stock's pedigree is undeniable. Since its IPO in 1980, Apple has delivered gains of 225,071%. That stratospheric rise isn't limited to the distant past, either. Apple soared 792% over the past 10 years (as of this writing), more than four and a half times the return of the S&P 500.\n\nYet Apple stock could soar even higher on the secular tailwinds of AI. Let's review the factors that could push the iPhone maker above $4 trillion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGrowth on hold\n\nInvestors might not be thinking of Apple as a supercharged growth stock, but its record is undeniable. Over the past decade, the company's revenue has grown 104%, while its net income has climbed 153%, which has fueled its soaring stock price.\n\nApple's growth has come as the company has captured an ever-increasing share of the smartphone market. In the list of top 10 smartphones of 2023, Apple devices took the top seven spots, according to data supplied by Counterpoint Research. What makes that achievement all the more remarkable is that it occurred during one of the worst economic downturns in decades.\n\nNow that the specter of inflation is fading, consumers will be more likely to upgrade their devices. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates there are roughly 300 million active iPhones that haven't been upgraded in more than four years. Improving economic conditions will leave people with more discretionary income, increasing the likelihood they will opt for a new iPhone when Apple's new models are unveiled next week. Ives estimates the company could sell as many as 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, kicking off an AI-driven upgrade \"super cycle.\"\n\nThe AI wild card\n\nWhile some users snap up the newest iPhone as soon as it becomes available, many tend to wait for a major upgrade before laying out their hard-earned cash for a new device. The upcoming model is expected to be a doozy. While Apple is playing its cards close to the vest, the company is expected to unveil the first iPhone featuring generative AI capabilities, marking a new chapter for Apple.\n\nAt the company's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June, Apple provided the first look at Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-powered features that will be included in an upcoming iOS update. These include:\n\nAI-powered summaries in Mail and Messages Voicemail transcriptions Improved photo searches Long-awaited improvements to Siri Troubleshooting help for Apple devices Image and text generation Integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nWall Street and Main Street alike have been captivated by the potential of generative AI, and many iPhone users will be interested to see what Apple brings to the table.\n\nThe case for $4 trillion\n\nMake no mistake: Apple's results have always been tied to sales of its flagship iPhone, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (which will end in September), the iPhone was responsible for 52% of Apple's total sales, so the path to $4 trillion goes through the iPhone.\n\nAccording to Wall Street, Apple is poised to generate revenue of $390 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Apple would have to grow its revenue to roughly $465 billion annually to support a $4 trillion market cap. The company could conservatively surpass this threshold by early 2027.\n\nIves is more bullish. He believes that if Apple introduces compelling AI technology with its up-and-coming iPhone -- and I believe it will -- this will act as the linchpin for the next phase of the company's growth. Not only will Apple likely sell the aforementioned 240 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, but the accompanying sales of hardware and software will combine to add $30 to $40 to Apple's share price, pushing its market cap above $4 trillion over the coming 12 to 18 months.\n\nIt's important to remember this is fun with math, but the underlying thesis is sound. Earlier this year, Apple revealed there were 2.2 billion active devices in the world, including an estimated 1.4 billion active iPhones, according to online data company Statista. A compelling new AI-powered iPhone could be the catalyst for a significant upgrade cycle.\n\nApple is currently selling for a premium at roughly 33 times earnings, but given its track record of growth, I'd argue it's deserved. Furthermore, when the aforementioned \"super cycle\" plays out -- and I have no doubt it will -- this price could end up being a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple's ubiquitous iPhone is about to break new ground with a shift into artificial intelligence that will do everything from smartening up its frequently dim-witted assistant Siri to creating customized emojis on the fly.\n\nThe new era will dawn Monday with the unveiling of the hotly anticipated iPhone 16 in a Cupertino, California, auditorium named after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who pulled out the first iPhone in 2007 and waved it like a magic wand while predicting it would reshape society.\n\nApple has sold billions of iPhones since then, helping to create about $3 trillion in shareholder wealth. But in the past decade, there have been mostly minor upgrades from one model to the next — a factor that has caused people to hold off on buying a new iPhone and led to a recent slump in sales of Apple's marquee product.\n\nThe iPhone 16 is generating a bigger buzz because it is the first model to be tailored specifically for AI, a technology that is expected to trigger the biggest revolution in the industry since Jobs thrust Apple into the smartphone market 17 years ago.\n\nThe advances included in the iPhone 16 could set up Apple to be “the gatekeeper of the consumer AI revolution,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note.\n\nApple's pivot began three months ago with a preview of its new approach during a developers conference, helping to build anticipation for Monday's showcase.\n\nSince that June conference, competitors such as Samsung and Google have made even more strides in AI. Google even took the unusual step of introducing its latest Pixel phones packed with their own AI magic last month instead of hewing to its traditional October timetable in an effort to upstage Apple's release of the iPhone 16.\n\nIn an attempt to set itself apart from the early leaders in AI, the technology being baked into the iPhone 16 is being promoted as “Apple Intelligence.” Even so, Apple Intelligence is similar to the generically named AI already available on Google's Pixel 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S24 released in January.\n\nMost of Apple's AI tasks will be performed on the iPhone itself instead of remote data centers — a distinction that requires a special processor within the forthcoming models and the high-end iPhone 15s that came out a year ago.\n\nThat's why investors anticipate hot demand for the iPhone 16, spurring a surge in sales that has caused Apple's stock price to climb by 13% since Apple previewed its AI strategy in June. That spike has increased the company's market value by nearly $400 billion.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "With the latest round of 13F filings released over the past month, investors and market watchers alike are interested in seeing where the major hedge fund managers are finding value opportunities.\n\nBackground\n\nManagers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. These filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. For second-quarter 2024, that means managers must disclose all qualifying assets held on June 30, 2024 by Aug. 15, 2024. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs, call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts, cash positions, foreign investments and other assets are not included.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of these 13F filings to create portfolios from managers that have proven past success. Despite the 45-day delay in reporting, research has shown that investing alongside a single manager or group of managers can outperform the market. The key is to identify the best and most consistent funds to copy.\n\nThe statistics in this report are based on our Premium gurus. These gurus are our hand-picked, best-performing value investors that have proven long-term records.\n\nMagnificent 7 stocks make up large portion of the Aggregated Portfolio\n\nThe GuruFocus Aggregated Portfolio, a Premium feature based on these managers' quarterly filings, shows the 10 most broadly held stocks as of the end of the second quarter of 2024 included some Magnificent Seven names that were also popular in the previous quarter, such as software giant Microsoft Corp.

According to GuruFocus Hot Picks, that honor only goes to a handful of companies, including UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM). However, a couple of these companies also recorded a lot of selling activity over the same period, such as Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).\n\nStory continues\n\nTicker Company Buys Sells No. of Guru Owners UNH UnitedHealth Group Inc. 25 13 40 AAPL Apple Inc. 21 16 41 CVS CVS Health Corp. 19 8 26 XOM Exxon Mobil Corp. 19 9 25 MSFT Microsoft Corp. 17 39 59 AVGO Broadcom Inc. 16 11 26 COP ConocoPhillips 16 10 27 ADBE Adobe Inc. 16 11 29 GEV GE Vernova Inc. 15 13 18 TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

While Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) and Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV) are listed, they were not necessarily sold. Rather, these companies were acquired or merged with other companies and, therefore, are recorded as a sale in our database. As such, News Corp.

They added that the initial release will only be available in U.S. English, with support for other languages planned over the next year.\n\nDespite the clamour for an AI-enhanced iPhone, the analysts remain cautious on Apple stock, citing regulatory headwinds, geopolitical risks, and economic challenges.\n\nStill, Apple's foray into gen AI will be closely watched to see how the tech product trendsetter plans to maintain its \"competitive edge in an increasingly saturated smartphone market,\" they added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's new iPhone to glow, but AI software to steal show at next week's launch\n\nLawmakers probe if US retailers bought Chinese auto parts that evaded tariffs\n\nBooking Holdings, Expedia Group face slowing travel headwinds amid wary consumers\n\nView comments",

The topline grew 42% to  $13.07 billion in the third quarter, topping the analyst estimate of $12.96 billion. The chipmaker expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14 billion, above the analyst consensus of $12.70 billion. The adjusted gross margin grew by 110 bps sequentially and 230 bps year-on-year to 77.4%.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur projected upside, citing robust AI growth, VMware momentum, and recovery in traditional semiconductor sectors.\n\nLast week, Nvidia’s second-quarter topline grew 122% to $30.04 billion, surpassing the analyst estimate of $28.68 billion. It expects third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion-$33.15 billion versus the analyst consensus of $31.77 billion. The adjusted gross margin declined 320 bps sequentially and grew by 450 bps year-on-year.\n\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a bullish outlook backed by data center and AI training demand and supply chain recovery.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which tracks the overall performance of the 25 largest U.S.-listed companies that produce semiconductors, including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and AMD, has been down 12% in the last five days. iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell 12% in the previous five days.\n\nNvidia has been down 15% in the last five days. AMD lost over 10%, and Taiwan Semiconductor lost 8%. The selloff refused to subside despite assurances from contract chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) regarding sustained AI demand.\n\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors (NYSE:USD), which corresponds to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index, lost 26% in the last five days.\n\nETFs with exposure to riskier indexes noted volatility during the period. ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSE:SSG), which corresponds to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index, gained 28% in the last five days.\n\nThe ETFs tracking broader indexes like the S&P 500 and NASDAQ saw relatively lesser value losses due to Big Tech stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 stock market index, including Big Tech stocks, lost 3.5% in the last five days.

The company is expected to debut four new iPhones, as well as a 10th-anniversary edition of the Apple Watch and new AirPods.\n\nThe showcase will also focus on rollout of the Apple Intelligence AI platform for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Apple's voice assistant Siri is due to get an update from this generative AI, marking its biggest upgrade since its release 2010, in what has been dubbed \"Siri 2.0\".\n\nBloomberg reported that the company will release Apple Intelligence as part of a software update in October.\n\nThe annual event, now billed as \"Glowtime\", is considered one of Apple's most important in its calendar and helps set the stage for the company for the year ahead.\n\nApple shares haven't seen much movement in the run up to the event, though the stock is up nearly 16% year-to-date, giving it a market capitalisation of $3.4tn (£2.5tn).\n\nRead more: ECB interest rate cut likely as Eurozone economy weaker than expected\n\nShares jumped after the company unveiled Apple Intelligence at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Apple is now seeing stronger year-to-date performance than fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which are up 9% and 13% so far this year, respectively.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the \"key is whether the integration with artificial intelligence will be enough to prompt an acceleration in upgrades to the newest handsets. It will be a few months before we see how that’s playing out\".\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's third quarter results beat Wall Street expectations, with it posting earnings of $1.40 per share, above estimates of $1.35. Revenue came in at $85.78bn versus the expected $84.46bn.\n\nGameStop (GME) — Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 10 September\n\nThe frenzy around meme stocks was reignited back in May, with shares brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop soaring.\n\nOther names such as cinema chain AMC Entertainment (AMC) and mobile phone maker BlackBerry (BB) also experienced surges in trading activity.\n\nThe meme stock trend, which originally emerged in 2021, referred to stocks that became popular with investors through social media, with them specifically targeting companies that had been heavily shorted.\n\nIts resurgence this year was fueled by the return of Roaring Kitty, the influential trader, to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter).\n\nRead more: What are the new rules around ISAs and fractional shares?\n\nGameStop's share price spiked again in early June, but the trend has since fizzled out, though the stock is up 28% year-to-date.\n\nIn terms of company performance, GameStop posted a net loss of $32.2m in its first quarter results released in June, though this was lower than the $50.5m it reported for the same period last year.\n\nThe company also reported that net sales had fallen to $882m in the first quarter, down from $1.2bn for the same three months in 2023.\n\nTapping into the appeal of classic gaming, the struggling retailer announced last week that it was launching a series of \"Retro GameStops\" stores.\n\nInditex (ITX.MC) — Reports first-half results on Wednesday 11 September\n\nStrong company performance from Zara-owner Inditex throughout the year so far has built momentum in its shares, notching a record closing high price of €49.40 (£41.58) in August.\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, the Madrid-listed stock has generated a return of 19%.\n\nThe owner of other high street favourites including Pull&Bear and Bershka, said in June that sales had risen 7% to €8.2bn in the first quarter, as spring/summer collections proved to be a hit with customers.\n\nInditex also reported a 7% increase in gross profits to €4.9bn for the period and an almost 11% rise in net income to €1.3bn.\n\nThat comes after it reported more than 10% sales growth for the full year of 2023, rising to €35.9bn.\n\nIn the 2023 results, released in March, Inditex also reported 12% growth in gross profits to €20.8bn and gross margins of nearly 58%.\n\nLooking ahead, it said it expected gross margins to be stable for 2024.\n\nInditex said in its full-year results that it was also planning to expand its logistics capacities, investing €900m in both 2024 and 2025 in this area.\n\nZacks Equity Research has identified Inditex as a growth stock, highlighting that the company's earnings per share are expected to grow 12.1% this year, versus an industry average of 11.9%.\n\nUBS director Silky Agarwal: \"We expect the key focus of the market to be on [Inditex's] sales growth and current trading for August.\"\n\nShe said that the UBS team expect sales growth of 10% for the second quarter and earnings before interest and tax of nearly €1.9bn.\n\nOracle (ORCL) — Reports first-quarter results on Monday 9 September\n\nShares in software company Oracle jumped after it announced cloud deals with Google and OpenAI in June. As one of the world's largest database management companies, it develops software, hardware and cloud services to help companies manage their data.\n\nThe rise in Oracle shares, up 35% year-to-date, comes despite the fact that the company's fourth-quarter results fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nTotal revenue rose 3% to $14.3bn, while net income came in at $3.1bn, down from $3.3bn for the same period in 2023. Earnings per share stood at $1.11, down from $1.19 the year before.\n\nFor the whole of its fiscal year 2024, it reported 6% total revenue growth.\n\nAs for first-quarter guidance, Oracle said it expected revenue to grow between 5% and 7%.\n\nSafra Catz, CEO of Oracle, said: \"Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales and RPO [remaining performance obligation] even higher — and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year.\"\n\nRPO acts as an indicator of revenue that has been contracted but not yet invoiced.\n\n\"I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter — as OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] capacity begins to catch up with demand,\" Catz added.\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L) — Reports full-year trading update on Wednesday 11 September\n\nShares in WH Smith are no higher than were they stood a decade ago, point out AJ Bell's investment experts Russ Mould, Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth.\n\nThey said that the stock has been \"hindered by COVID-19 and its effects upon domestic and global travel, rail strikes in the UK and weaker newspaper and magazine volumes, thanks to the rise of online sources of news and entertainment\".\n\nShares are down 6% year-to-date.\n\nHowever, they explained that the books and stationary retailer has responded with a five-point plan, which includes space growth primarily in travel and overseas and cost efficiencies.\n\nThese changes have already benefitted the company, they said, as WH Smith reported third-quarter sales were up 5% year-on-year.\n\nIt also reiterated its full-year guidance, with statutory profit before tax set to reach £158m.\n\n\"Even so, one concern was the lack of like-for-like sales growth in the USA, where WH Smith had moved aggressively pre-COVID to establish an improved position through the acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 of technology specialist InMotion and then Marshall Retail Group,\" said Mould, Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\n\"Start-up costs and investment in US contract wins and stores also mean the profit drop-through from an overall increase in revenues in North America is relatively limited for the moment, although the potential for a longer-term uplift is there as the operation reaches greater maturity,\" they added.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 9 September\n\nComputacenter (CCC.L)\n\nC&C Group (CCR.L)\n\nTuesday 10 September\n\nCentral Asia Metals (CAML.L)\n\nGamma Communications (GAMA.L)\n\nSerica Energy (SQZ.L)\n\nIQE (IQE.L)\n\nHViVO (HVO.L)\n\nFutura Medical (FUM.L)\n\nInspecs (SPEC.L)\n\nWednesday 11 September\n\nDunelm (DNLM.L)\n\nRicardo Group (RCDO.L)\n\nPan African Resources (PAF.L)\n\nFrontier Development (FDEV.L)\n\nGym Group (GYM.L)\n\nTrustpilot (TRST.L)\n\nInditex (ITX.MC)\n\nThursday 12 September\n\nFeverTree Drinks (FEVR.L)\n\nTrainline (TRN.L)\n\nRenishaw (RSW.L)\n\nKier (KIE.L)\n\nSpire Healthcare (SPI.L)\n\nInspired (INSE.L)\n\nKeystone Law (KEYS.L)\n\nHarworth (HWG.L)\n\nAdobe (ADBE)\n\nKroger (KR)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Funds With $350 Billion Are Exposed to S&amp;P’s New Index-Cap Rules",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Index-tracking stock funds with $350 billion in assets are due for a big revamp later this month, after S&P Dow Jones Indices retooled its rules to curb the dominance of the largest companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nWith the equity market getting increasingly top-heavy in the era of Big Tech, S&P will now reduce the weightings of the market leaders in proportion to their capitalization — in the event they get even bigger and breach size-related thresholds in key industry benchmarks, it said in a statement this week.\n\nIt’s a material departure from the current approach where the smallest of the group gets their weighting trimmed at first, when preset thresholds are triggered.\n\nAt issue is rising concentration risk this year. Investment managers are battling to ensure their exposures to a handful of booming technology companies don’t hit decades-old regulatory limits. But the new rules will have ripple effects far and wide — with the benchmark provider introducing the new capping initiative across its sector indexes tracking everything from consumer staples to energy and communications.\n\nThe incoming rule, adopted after a month-long consultation with market participants, means passive investment vehicles like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) will need to shuffle their holdings accordingly at their next quarterly rebalance.\n\nWhen the changes in the S&P’s capping methodology take effect at the market close on Sept. 20, Piper Sandler & Co. estimates $31 billion of trades will be unleashed across major ETFs, with roughly half of that coming from technology.\n\nThe revision is welcome news for the fund industry, according to Michael Kantrowitz, Piper’s chief investment strategist. The old way to restrain the behemoths has at times left investment funds under-exposed to key names like Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. — and sparked volatile share turnovers earlier this year.\n\nIt “appears to be in attempt to enhance the distribution of weightings more evenly across the indices’ construction while reducing unnecessary turnover,” Kantrowitz said. “This should mitigate some of the issues that led to enormous tracking error,” he added, referring to the performance gap between a capped sector index and its uncapped version.\n\nThe move is the latest among all-powerful index providers to adapt to a concentrated equity market that pushes against regulatory limits. Similar restrictions last year spurred the overseer of the Nasdaq 100 to carry out a special rebalance to keep index-tracking funds in compliance with the rules. Last month, FTSE Russell conducted a consultation about capping the weighting of the largest members of its widely followed US growth and value gauges.\n\nStory continues\n\nCreating headaches for these index overlords are longstanding diversification norms for regulated investment companies that limit any single security to 25% of a portfolio and the aggregate weight of the largest holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%. Established to safeguard investors from over-exposure to too few names, the 25/5/50 restrictions can be punishing in the modern market where companies such as Nvidia and Apple keep getting bigger.\n\nS&P’s capping trigger levels, which are slightly below the 25/5/50 limits to provide a buffer, have stayed the same as 24/4.8/50 this time. The revisions involve how the capping process is executed.\n\nRight now, three stocks each made up at least 4.8% of the uncapped tech gauge: Apple at 23%, Microsoft Corp. at 22% and Nvidia at 19%. With the total surpassing 60%, their weights will be reduced in proportion to their size to meet the 50% limit at the next rebalance. Then the extra weight will be distributed to the index’s other constituents, with a cap at 4.5%.\n\nThe old methodology would require the smallest of the top stocks to get capped first and in that scenario, Nvidia would be cut to 4.5%.\n\nThat’s what happened with XLK in the first half of this year, when Nvidia was surging. As a result, the fund trailed the uncapped tech benchmark by 10 percentage points in the period — the worst underperformance on record.\n\nThen, when Nvidia eclipsed Apple in June, it sparked a rebalance in which XLK bought an estimated $11 billion shares of the chipmaker at the expense of the iPhone manufacturer. Since then, Apple has outperformed, with the fund’s investors missing out on some gains.\n\nUnder S&P’s new rules, however, XLK is set to avoid another round of a big swap like June even as Nvidia has fallen behind Apple in market value.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE, Investors Title Co. ITIC and Autoscope Technologies Corp. AATC.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, Tesla and NextEra Energy\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Tesla, Inc. and NextEra Energy, Inc, as well as two micro-cap stocks Investors Title Co. and Autoscope Technologies Corp.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +15.1% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry's gain of +15.7%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter's (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues.\r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla's shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (-11.7% vs. -10.8%). The company has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts.\r\n\r\nTesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market. With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla's focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.\r\n\r\nThe expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA's Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+27.3% vs. +23.6%). The company continues to expand its operations through organic projects and acquisitions. NextEra Energy will add more renewable projects to its portfolio and has nearly 22.6 GW of renewable projects in its backlog.\r\n\r\nEfficient cost management is boosting the company's margins. Florida's improving economy boosts the company's subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company's customer base. NextEra Energy has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations.\r\n\r\nYet, due to the nature of NextEra Energy's business, it is subject to complex rules and regulations. Risks in operating nuclear power-based generation units, unfavorable weather conditions, and increasing supply costs can adversely impact earnings.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nInvestors Title's shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +33.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $422.46 million has demonstrated exceptional performance through consistent revenue and profit increases, with the first half of 2024 net income reaching $13.4 million, up from $8.8 million in the first half of 2023, driven by a 10% jump in net premiums and strong escrow and other service outputs.\r\n\r\nInvestors Title's resilience is further underscored by its robust balance sheet, with $26.7 million in cash and minimal liabilities, offering financial flexibility for potential growth initiatives like acquisitions. Technological advancements have propelled operational efficiencies, setting the stage for market share gains in a burgeoning global title insurance market.\r\n\r\nThe company's commitment to shareholder returns is evident from consistent dividends. However, it faces challenges from rising operating expenses, competitive pressures and volatile investment income, which could impact future earnings stability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Investors Tile here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Autoscope Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (+63.4% vs. +42.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $41.51 million is built on a stable revenue base, driven by recurring royalties, particularly from Autoscope Vision, which benefits from government-funded safety initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\r\n\r\nAutoscope Technologies showcases strong profitability with a 33% year-over-year increase in net income in second-quarter 2024, supported by a high gross margin and reduced operating expenses. A solid balance sheet, strategic dividend policy and alignment with long-term traffic safety trends further strengthen its appeal.\r\n\r\nHowever, heavy reliance on royalties, weak product sales margins, increasing tax expenses and dependence on a single customer pose risks. Emerging technologies and competitive pressures could challenge market share and profitability, adding volatility to the stock. As such, the AATC stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Autoscope Technologies here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

In the second quarter, the fund rose 7.09% (Institutional Shares) underperforming an 11.38% return for the MSCI ACWI Information Technology Index (the Benchmark) and outperforming the 4.28% gain for the S&P 500 index. For the first half of 2024, the fund delivered solid returns, increasing 22.86% compared to 24.80% and 15.29% returns for the indexes. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nBaron Technology Fund highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 2.84%, and its shares gained 24.81% of their value over the last three months. On September 5, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $222.38 per share with a market capitalization of $3.381 trillion.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n\nThis quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nStory continues 25 Most Powerful Brands in the US\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 9th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 184 hedge fund portfolios held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the second quarter which was 150 in the previous quarter. In the June quarter Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered $85.8 billion in revenues, up 5% from a year ago. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Everything to Expect From Apple’s iPhone 16 Launch on Sept. 9",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s most important event of the year takes place Monday, when the company will roll out its latest iPhones and set the stage for a new artificial intelligence platform.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nThe event kicks off from Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. local time. Apple doesn’t typically hold this event on a Monday, but the earlier timing lets the company get out ahead of an eventful Tuesday: There’s a US presidential debate that day, and the European Commission is slated to announce a decision on whether Apple has to pay $14 billion in taxes stemming from a longstanding agreement with Ireland.\n\nThe most significant product announcement will be the iPhone 16 line, but the company is also preparing major updates to both the Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Intelligence — a new suite of AI tools that includes an updated Siri digital assistant — also will feature prominently. The theme of the event, “It’s Glowtime,” is a reference to Siri’s new interface.\n\nThe stakes are high for Apple, which looks to prove to both consumers and Wall Street that it’s now a major player in generative artificial intelligence. But the company’s AI technology is still a work in progress. Apple Intelligence has faced numerous delays, and many key features won’t arrive until next year. For now, the technology is focused on summarizing messages and notifications, rather than matching the dazzling interactivity of rival systems.\n\nEven so, Monday’s updates will breathe new life into products that sit at the heart of the Apple device lineup and generate roughly 60% of the company’s annual revenue. They also drive consumer spending on services, an increasingly vital source of sales. Apple’s finances could use the boost. The company has only just begun to emerge from its longest sales slump in decades.\n\nHere’s everything that’s expected to be announced at Monday’s presentation:\n\niPhone\n\nIn line with the past several years, Apple will introduce four new iPhone models: the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. Like in 2023, the changes to the non-Pro iPhones will be minor. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will look like last year’s versions, including 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen sizes and aluminum cases. They’ll gain faster processors and include a total of 8 gigabytes of memory (up from 6). That memory will help support Apple Intelligence and other features. Those lower-end phones will get the same Action button currently featured on the Pro models, as well as vertically stacked rear cameras that support spatial video recording — the 3D clips that can be viewed with Apple’s Vision Pro headsets. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, meanwhile, will retain the iPhone 15 Pro line design save for one noticeable change: the displays. The screen sizes are increasing to 6.3 inches on the smaller model (up from from 6.1 inches) and going to 6.9 inches from 6.7 inches on the Max version. While the changes represent an increase of less than 5% on both models, the shift will come with bezels that are now about a third slimmer. That should make for a sleeker overall look. Like the iPhone 15 Pro line, the 16 Pro models will support Apple Intelligence with the inclusion of 8 gigabytes of memory. They’ll also get speedier chips with an enhanced neural engine that Apple will say is optimized for AI. Both of the iPhone 16 Pro models will get camera upgrades as well, including a move to a 48-megapixel lens from a 12-megapixel one for the ultrawide-angle camera. That will match the megapixels of the standard, wide-angle camera on last year’s model. The smaller iPhone 16 Pro will also gain 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, up from 3x, to match the Max version. The most significant camera enhancement coming to both models: a dedicated, touch-sensitive button on the right side of the phone for taking photos and video. This button will be the biggest selling point for the new iPhones, other than AI. It will work similarly to a shutter button on a DSLR camera, allowing a user to lightly press it to focus on a subject and then press harder to take a picture. It will also be capacitive, allowing a user to swipe across it to move between still and video modes and zoom in and out. While the phones will all look mostly the same as last year, Apple is shaking up its color palette. The Pro models will now come in a gold titanium to replace blue titanium, while the black, white and natural options will still be available. The non-Pro versions will trade in yellow for white and get new shades of green, pink and blue.\n\nStory continues\n\nAirPods\n\nApple is preparing two new AirPods models to replace the entry-level, second-generation earbuds and mid-tier, third-generation model. Both new versions will look similar to the AirPods Pro and include a new case, USB-C charging and improved audio quality. Apple will distinguish the two models by giving the new mid-tier version a higher-end case with a speaker — making it easier to locate with Apple’s Find My feature — as well as noise cancellation to match the AirPods Pro. A few weeks ago, Apple discovered a bug in the upcoming AirPods that made the earbuds quickly drain battery life. This issue was determined to be software-related and resolved prior to factories shipping out the products. One major new feature is a bigger push into hearing health. Apple has been working to turn the AirPods into a replacement for hearing aids as well as a device for conducting hearing tests. The company is preparing to announce the enhancements — codenamed Yodel — but they’ve suffered some delays and may not be available until later. A new version of the AirPods Pro remains in the works, including an upgraded design and improved noise cancellation. It’s due as early as next year. And Apple has been working on updated AirPods Max headphones that will come in new colors and switch the Lightning connector to USB-C to comply with the latest laws from the European Union. But there’s still plenty of current AirPods Max inventory on hand, suggesting that the update could be coming later.\n\nApple Watch\n\nFor the first time in two years, the company is preparing to update all of its Apple Watch models at once. There will be a new low-end Apple Watch SE, a mid-level Series 10 model and an Ultra 3. The Apple Watch Ultra will only get minor tweaks, focusing on internal upgrades rather than outside changes. The biggest upgrade to the Apple Watch line will be with the Series 10 model, which marks the decade anniversary of the product’s introduction in 2014. For the first time since the Series 7, the flagship Apple Watch model will get an updated look. The overall design will be similar to the Apple Watch Series 9, but the company will now offer slightly larger screen-size options and the watch case itself will be noticeably thinner. Though new AI features are coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac, don’t expect the watches to get major Apple Intelligence capabilities. Any AI technology will probably be tied specifically to a future health coach service. At the start of the year, Apple was forced to remove blood-oxygen sensing from new watches due to a lawsuit with Masimo Corp. over patents. There’s been no evidence that the feature is returning in time for the latest models, and that may affect whether users want to upgrade their existing watches to versions that won’t have the function. A major new health feature is coming, though: sleep apnea detection, which will build on the existing sleep tracking. This feature will attempt to determine if a wearer has sleep apnea and then suggest further testing with a medical professional. While Apple has been preparing to announce it, the enhancement may not be available on day one of the new model going on sale. On the other hand, while Apple aimed to bring hypertension — or high blood pressure — detection to the Apple Watch this year, signs point to that feature being delayed and no longer in the cards for an immediate release.\n\nOther Products\n\nApple is working on transitioning its entire Mac line to M4 chips, starting with the MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac. But any Mac upgrades are likely to come at a follow-up launch — no earlier than October — rather than at the September event. While the company has been working on an update to the Apple TV set-top box for as early as this year, no new model has come to fruition and stable inventory of the device suggests a new version isn’t on the immediate horizon. A new iPhone SE with an OLED display, edge-to-edge screen and no home button is in advanced testing, but a release isn’t planned until next year. A fresh AirTag is also in development, though Apple isn’t planning a release until next year either. There are also new iPads in the works, including an upgraded mini version. They’re on deck for Apple’s October event alongside the M4 Macs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) Is What I Call An Up Stock’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn’t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let’s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don’t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\n\nSo, can I just take a moment to speak some words that we all believe but very rarely get to say in polite conversation? Look, money's important. It's really important. And caring about the state of your finances does not make you seem like some sort of superficial bourgeois monster. Say you’ve got a lousy credit score and you want to get married—congratulations, you've just inflicted your horrible credit on your new spouse. Now neither you nor your partner will be able to qualify to buy a car or a home or perhaps even just get a darn credit card.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\n\nSo let me answer one of the most important questions out there: What the heck should young people do with their money? First, foremost, and always, you need to invest. That's the only way you're going to be able to achieve financial freedom. And by freedom, I mean living a life where you're not totally dependent on the next paycheck. Teaching you how to do this is one of the reasons I actually put so much time and energy into creating the CNBC Investing Club. I'm always thrilled when I see younger members taking an active hand in managing their own money.\"\n\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they’re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\n\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it’s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\n\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\n\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\n\"Here’s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 120\n\nJim Cramer refers to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) as an \"up stock,\" a term he uses to describe stocks that consistently perform well. He recalls that Leon Cooperman first introduced him to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) in the early 1980s, and the stock has continued to show positive performance since then. Cramer highlights that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) remains a strong investment choice today.\n\n\"Berkshire Hathaway is what I call an up stock. It's been that way since Leon Cooperman first told me about it in 1983 and '84, and it remains an up stock even today.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a strong investment due to its diverse portfolio and financial stability. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) spans various sectors, including insurance with GEICO, energy through Berkshire Hathaway Energy, railroads with BNSF Railway, and consumer goods like Duracell and See’s Candies. This broad diversification reduces risk and provides steady revenue streams, allowing Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) to thrive in different economic conditions.\n\nIts insurance operations generate significant cash flow, which Warren Buffett uses for strategic investments, supporting long-term growth. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)'s investment portfolio includes major stakes in top-performing companies like Apple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\n(NYSE:KO), enhancing stability and growth potential. Warren Buffett’s proven investment strategy, combined with a strong balance sheet and over $100 billion in cash, gives Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) flexibility for acquisitions and share buybacks.\n\nOverall BRK-B ranks 3rd on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BRK-B but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Following the stock picks of billionaires can help any investor become more informed about the markets and what stocks might be worth closer consideration. Billionaire investors tend to focus on relatively safe companies that can grow and preserve wealth, and they can afford to conduct thorough research into the companies they invest in. They have shown a propensity for avoiding companies that have peaked and/or are losing their competitive edge.\n\nBillionaires Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and Daniel Loeb of Third Point currently hold large stakes in two tech stocks that are among the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Halvorsen has had a very successful career as a professional investment manager. His net worth is estimated at $7 billion, according to Forbes. Loeb has an estimated net worth of $3 billion, according to the same source.\n\nViking Global bought more shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the second quarter, while Third Point started a position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Here's why these two Dow stocks getting added billionaire attention are smart buys right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nCoincidentally, Amazon is the largest holding for both Viking Global and Third Point. Despite the stock's sharp rebound since bottoming out in 2022, Viking Global bought more shares in the second quarter, suggesting the stock still offers attractive potential.\n\nAmazon saw accelerating growth in its market-leading cloud computing business this year. Management is also working to improve margins on the retail side. Operating profit grew 91% year over year last quarter. The growing profits provide more resources to pursue opportunities to strengthen its e-commerce business, its largest revenue source.\n\nAmazon is currently laying the groundwork to launch a satellite internet service, a market expected to grow 13% per year through 2030, according to Grand View Research. The company's new broadband service, Project Kuiper, is going after up to 500 million households that don't have broadband connectivity. It could be Amazon's next multibillion-dollar revenue stream.\n\nThese investments are ultimately widening the company's economic moat by creating a stickier service for customers to find what they need. It explains why the stock is the top holding for these billionaires, and why Amazon should be worth a lot more in 10 years than it is today.\n\n2. Apple\n\nOne of Third Point's new positions in the second quarter was Apple. Like Amazon, it benefits from a strong brand name. The smartphone market is very competitive, but the iPhone still brought in trailing-12-month revenue of $198 billion, roughly half of Apple's business.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrand Finance ranked the company as the top brand in the world in its annual Global Top 500 2024 report. Apple has been very successful in recent years at building a sticky ecosystem of apps and services that work together across the company's devices, which is why customers tend to pay a premium for its products.\n\nApple controls only less than 20% of global smartphone unit sales, so it has a lot of opportunity to convert more users over the long term. Management continues to invest in opening more retail stores (it just opened its first location in Malaysia).\n\nIts active installed base of devices grew to new highs in every geographic segment last quarter, which suggests there is still great potential for the brand worldwide.\n\nThe launch of new artificial intelligence (AI) features will go a long way to stimulating more demand for iPhone upgrades over the next few years. An increasing installed base should lead to more profitable growth that fuels returns for Apple investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $650,810!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Investment advisory firm Ithaka Group released the “Ithaka US Growth Strategy” second-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter of 2024 saw a surge in optimism among global markets, driven by the anticipation of a looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and the ongoing development prospects presented by artificial intelligence (AI). This positive outlook increased the S&P 500 by 4.3% for the quarter and 15.3% for the year, the Russell 1000 Growth (“R1000G”) by 8.3% for the quarter and 21.7% for the year, and the Dow decreasing by 1.7% for the quarter and increasing by 3.7% for the year. In the second quarter, the portfolio underperformed and returned 4.2% (gross of fees) compared to the Russell 1000 Growth’s (R1G) 8.3% return. Stock Selection led the portfolio to underperform in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc.

The company also sells several high-margin consumer services including Advertising, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Digital Content and Payment Services. The stock’s outperformance during the quarter was due to hopes the September release of the iPhone 16, which will for the first time incorporate artificial intelligence into a widely used consumer device, could drive a golden upgrade cycle for Apple.\"\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 9th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 184 hedge fund portfolios held Apple Inc.

        "content": "Billionaires Are Buying Retail Stocks, Shrugging Off Recession Fears\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nInvestors closely track investments made by billionaires worldwide, especially in a volatile market backdrop. While U.S. equities overwhelmingly rallied in August, key benchmark indexes traded lower during the first week of September as the markets waited for the release of key employment data. Market volatility has risen dramatically over the past week, as evident from the CBOE Volatility Index's 31% gains over the past five days.\n\nHowever, billionaires are shrugging off looming recession fears that have grappled the broader market, reflecting their faith in the U.S. economy. Some of the world's wealthiest and most influential financiers are doubling down on retail stocks. These moves suggest deep confidence in the resilience of consumer-facing businesses.\n\nDon't Miss Out:\n\nGet ‘em while you can — investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now. Looking to trade options, stocks, ETFs, and more? Get started with the trading platform that is a one-stop shop.\n\nRetail Stocks: A Comeback Story\n\nThe retail sector has been at the center of economic debate recently. Rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions have all contributed to a murky outlook for consumer markets.\n\nNonetheless, consumers are spending money despite the delayed rate cuts, as advanced retail sales rose by 1% month-over-month in July, beating the 0.2% consensus estimate.\n\n\"Once again, this was further evidence that the U.S. consumer still can surprise to the upside,\" Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair, said. \"This was another solid report, and inconsistent with a consumer who is on the brink of collapse.\"\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. GDP rose by an estimated 3% in the second quarter of 2024, according to data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nThis, coupled with noteworthy investments from Wall Street's biggest names, could signal a bull market for retail stocks. Their investments often serve as a strong endorsement of their ability to grow and prosper in a fluctuating economy.\n\nBill Ackman's Bet on Nike\n\nWith a net worth of over $9 billion, Bill Ackman is a controversial yet highly respected hedge fund manager known for his bold and contrarian investment bets. He often leverages his social media presence to generate enthusiasm regarding his latest investments and strategic bets.\n\nAckman spent the last few months trying to launch a new closed-end fund, Pershing Square USA, which could double his total assets under management. However, his fund’s initial public offering was scrapped on July 31 as he couldn't garner the desired funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, Ackman's latest investment in Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has stirred investors, as the stock made a stellar comeback after recording its worst-ever performance in June. As of the end of the second quarter of 2024, Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management holds over three million shares of NKE.\n\nNike's slowing sales have been a cause for concern for investors. The company expected its earnings to decline by at least 10% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 (ended August) due to sluggish demand from China. Consequently, NKE stock declined by 21% intraday following its earnings release.\n\nAckman's endorsement has rejuvenated optimism about Nike stock, as NKE shares have increased by over 9% over the past month.\n\nRead More:\n\nPrivate credit outperformed both high-yield bonds and equities in the last 3 market downturns (2008, COVID and 2022). Should you be adding private credit to your portfolio? Allocating just 5% of your portfolio to this asset class could bring you big returns. Should you be invested in fine art?\n\nWarren Buffett's Strategic Move With Ulta Beauty Investment\n\nStock market guru Warren Buffett's investment portfolio was scrutinized after the world's sixth-richest man reduced his stake in tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) last quarter. Buffett also held $277 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, a move that drew significant attention from Wall Street, with Elon Musk labeling it \"wild.\"\n\nBuffett also invested a significant portion of his portfolio in Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), with his total investment valued at approximately $266 million as of June 30.\n\nHowever, the company's financials took a hit in the last quarter, as its revenues and earnings were lower than the consensus estimates for the quarter ended August 3. But Ulta Beauty's CEO Dave Kimbell chalked this up to an \"unanticipated operational disruption,\" claiming they had \"actions underway to address the trends.\"\n\nNonetheless, Ulta Beauty has been taking active steps to accelerate sales, primarily through endorsements with high-profile celebrities and upscaling its loyalty program and promotional levers. The Oracle of Omaha has invested in ULTA stock, which has risen by over 10% over the past month.\n\nA 9% Return In Just 3 Months\n\nEquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\n\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company is planning to launch the next generation of the iPhone lineup in the coming days. This annual event has received more attention than usual around the globe because the tech giant is expected to unveil new AI features for these phones. Wall Street analysts have predicted that these features would not be backward compatible and would thus lead to a major upgrade cycle in iPhone. Since 50% of the total revenue base of the firm is based around iPhones, investors in the company are eagerly waiting for the launch event. Lagging iPhone sales in recent years have slowed the revenue growth for Apple, leading to concerns around the EPS trajectory as well.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at a forward PE of 32, which indicates that much of the AI hype has already been priced into the stock. This is because peers in the tech world, who are also spending massively on AI and have AI-related products in the pipeline, are trading at lower multiples. For example, Google is trading at a forward PE of 21, while Meta is trading at a forward PE of almost 25. Percentage figures highlight this data even better. Apple stock is trading nearly 50% higher in forward PE data compared to Google, and 40% higher than Meta.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nDespite the significant growth and investor interest in artificial intelligence stocks, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday the sector is not in a speculative bubble, unlike previous technology booms such as the late 1990s internet bubble.\n\nYet the analysts highlight the importance of diversification given the high concentration risk among leading tech companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe extraordinary performance of tech stocks in recent years has been justified by their earnings, said Goldman stategist Peter Oppenheimer.\n\nGlobal tech earnings per share have risen by approximately 400% since the global financial crisis, while non-tech sectors achieved a comparatively modest 25% increase, he said.\n\n“The technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to continue to dominate returns,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nTech Valuations Remain Reasonable: Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs highlights a key difference between the AI-driven rally and previous market bubbles.\n\nThe valuations of major tech players are significantly lower than those of tech stocks during past speculative phases.\n\nFor instance, while the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — account for over 30% of the S&P 500's market weight (compared to 19% for tech giants in the 2000s), they trade at nearly half the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seen in the prior dot-com bubble.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($bn) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Apple 7.3 3,387 26.5 7.7 Microsoft 6.6 3,043 25.7 9.4 NVIDIA 5.7 2,649 24.1 13.2 Amazon 4.0 1,850 25.4 2.5 Alphabet 3.9 1,808 16.6 2.0 Meta Platforms 2.4 1,118 19.2 5.5 Tesla 1.4 672 55.4 4.9 Magnificent 7 31.3 14,527 23.9 5.0\n\nIn contrast, tech giants during the 2000s dot-com bubble were trading at much higher multiples. Cisco Systems, for example, had a forward P/E of 101.7, while Intel‘s was 42.1, significantly inflating their valuations relative to the broader market.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($B) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Microsoft 4.5 581 53.2 19.2 Cisco Systems 4.2 543 101.7 17.5 Intel 3.6 465 42.1 N/A Oracle 1.9 245 84.6 N/A IBM 1.7 218 23.5 28 Lucent Technologies 1.6 206 37.9 N/A Nortel Networks 1.5 199 86.4 N/A 2000 Bubble Leaders 19.0 2,457 52.0 N/A\n\nDiversification: Key To Reduce Major Volatility Events\n\nThe Goldman Sachs equity team is flagging the concentration risks that come with this tech dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a few stocks dominate market returns, the potential for “stock-specific mistakes” increases, exposing the broader market to severe corrections, Oppenheimer said. For instance, before the July market correction, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 50% of the S&P 500's total returns for the year.\n\n“A market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation,” he said.\n\nA risk also exists that heightened competition and new entrants into the AI space could compress margins and slow growth for the market leaders.\n\nGoldman Sachs recommends seeking opportunities beyond the tech behemoths, particularly in smaller tech companies and sectors tied to infrastructure spending, which may benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe growth of infrastructure capex could boost old-economy industries that incorporate AI technologies into their operations, the firm said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Could Face Major Swings Under Harris Or Trump Tax Plans, Goldman Sachs Warns\n\nPhoto via Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Broadcom Gives Tepid Forecast in Sign of Slower Non-AI Sales",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, gave a lackluster revenue forecast in a sign that slower demand for products outside of AI is weighing on growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris\n\nSales will be roughly $14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which runs through October, the company said in a statement Thursday. Analysts had projected about $14.1 billion.\n\nThe forecast suggests that Broadcom’s non-AI operations are growing more slowly than anticipated. Though the company has benefited from a surge in artificial intelligence spending, its other divisions aren’t as connected to this bonanza. The company has a wide variety of offerings, including mainframe products, security and data center software, mobile-phone chips and data storage gear.\n\nBroadcom shares fell about 5% in extended trading following the announcement. The stock closed at $152.82 in regular New York trading, leaving it up 37% for the year.\n\nThe company is projecting $12 billion of revenue from AI-related products for the full year, beating the average analyst projection of $11.8 billion. That suggests that the shortfall in the total quarterly sales forecast came from other areas.\n\nThird-quarter profit was $1.24 a share, excluding some items. That compared with an average estimate of $1.22. Revenue rose to $13.07 billion, compared with a projection of $13.03 billion. The company is much larger than it was a year ago, partly because of its acquisition of VMware Inc., which it bought for roughly $69 billion.\n\nBroadcom’s semiconductor division had revenue of $7.27 billion in the three months ended Aug. 4. Software sales were $5.8 billion.\n\nChief Executive Officer Hock Tan turned Broadcom into one of the largest players in the chip industry through a series of acquisitions. His strategy is to find businesses that are dominant in certain fields, purchase those companies, and then refocus them exclusively on those areas. Tan also has used that formula to expand into software.\n\nThe AI spending boom has turned Broadcom’s chip peer Nvidia Corp. into the biggest, most valuable company in the industry. Nvidia sells so-called AI accelerators that help develop tools such as ChatGPT, but Broadcom has benefited as well by supplying related components and software.\n\nData center providers rely on Broadcom’s custom-chip design and networking semiconductors to build their AI systems. The company also sells components for cars, smartphones and internet access gear. Its push into software, meanwhile, includes products for mainframe computers, cybersecurity and data center optimization.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a top customer as well: Broadcom provides key components for the iPhone. During earnings calls, Tan typically gives updates on Broadcom’s often-contentious relationship with that company, which he refers to obliquely as his “North American customer.”\n\n(Updates with more from results in fifth paragraph.)\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Thursday, September 5, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE), as well as two micro-cap stocks Investors Title Co. (ITIC) and Autoscope Technologies Corp. (AATC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +15.1% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s gain of +15.7%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. \r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (-11.7% vs. -10.8%). The company has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. \r\n\r\nTesla expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market. With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla’s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture. \r\n\r\nThe expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NextEra Energy have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+27.3% vs. +23.6%). The company continues to expand its operations through organic projects and acquisitions. NextEra Energy will add more renewable projects to its portfolio and has nearly 22.6 GW of renewable projects in its backlog.\r\n\r\nEfficient cost management is boosting the company's margins. Florida’s improving economy boosts the company’s subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company’s customer base. NextEra Energy has ample liquidity to meet its short-term debt obligations. \r\n\r\nYet, due to the nature of NextEra Energy’s business, it is subject to complex rules and regulations. Risks in operating nuclear power-based generation units, unfavorable weather conditions, and increasing supply costs can adversely impact earnings.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NextEra Energy here >>>)\r\n\r\nInvestors Title’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +33.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $422.46 million has demonstrated exceptional performance through consistent revenue and profit increases, with the first half of 2024 net income reaching $13.4 million, up from $8.8 million in the first half of 2023, driven by a 10% jump in net premiums and strong escrow and other service outputs. \r\n\r\nInvestors Title's resilience is further underscored by its robust balance sheet, with $26.7 million in cash and minimal liabilities, offering financial flexibility for potential growth initiatives like acquisitions. Technological advancements have propelled operational efficiencies, setting the stage for market share gains in a burgeoning global title insurance market. \r\n\r\nThe company's commitment to shareholder returns is evident from consistent dividends. However, it faces challenges from rising operating expenses, competitive pressures and volatile investment income, which could impact future earnings stability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Investors Tile here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Autoscope Technologies have outperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past year (+63.4% vs. +42.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $41.51 million is built on a stable revenue base, driven by recurring royalties, particularly from Autoscope Vision, which benefits from government-funded safety initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. \r\n\r\nAutoscope Technologies showcases strong profitability with a 33% year-over-year increase in net income in second-quarter 2024, supported by a high gross margin and reduced operating expenses. A solid balance sheet, strategic dividend policy and alignment with long-term traffic safety trends further strengthen its appeal. \r\n\r\nHowever, heavy reliance on royalties, weak product sales margins, increasing tax expenses and dependence on a single customer pose risks. Emerging technologies and competitive pressures could challenge market share and profitability, adding volatility to the stock. As such, the AATC stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Autoscope Technologies here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ) and GSK plc (GSK).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\n\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. There has been lots of chatter around the company joining a funding round for OpenAI, a California-based AI startup that rose to fame after launching ChatGPT in late 2022. The latest estimates for the valuation of the startup place the worth of the firm at around $100 billion. Experts differ over the reasons that the tech giant might be investing in the company. Investment advisory Bank of America has detailed that a bigger Apple-OpenAI partnership might be on the cards if the former makes a large investment in the latter, possibly to rival Google in internet search.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has earned bullish reviews from Wall Street ahead of the release of the latest iPhones. Citi has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $255. In a recent investor note, the advisory named the firm as the top AI stock pick for 2025, noting that developer feedback on iOS18 beta artificial intelligence features, including the recently launched new photo feature to remove unwanted objects, points to AI as a compelling upgrade for iPhone refresh next year.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Apple iPhone 16 event: What to expect from the AI-packed 'Glowtime' show",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone event at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters on Monday, Sept. 9. The company is widely expected to debut four new iPhones, along with the tenth-anniversary edition of the Apple Watch and new AirPods.\n\nIn addition to hardware, the showcase will focus heavily on the rollout of Apple’s Apple Intelligence AI platform for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The company’s fall event is easily one of its most important of the year and helps set the tone for Apple’s year ahead, and I'll be on the ground in Cupertino bringing you all of the latest news.\n\nHere’s what to expect from Apple’s “Glowtime” show.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nApple Intelligence will bring a host of new capabilities to Apple’s product lines, including summarizing long text message threads, prioritizing and summarizing emails, and a much-needed upgrade for Apple’s Siri voice assistant.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will release Apple Intelligence as part of a software update in October, rather than alongside the company’s latest iPhones, to give developers more time to test out and build apps for the platform. Other Apple Intelligence features may not land on users’ iPhones until early 2025. Apple Intelligence is the company's first big swing at bringing generative AI to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nThe hope for the Glowtime event is that Apple will provide an update on when the software will be available and dig into any additional capabilities it has to offer.\n\nApple Intelligence could be one of the most consequential launches for Apple in years. The software will only run on the iPhone 15 Pro and newer models, giving investors hope that it will spur a new iPhone sales cycle. And with people holding onto their phones longer, Wall Street will welcome any means of getting users to upgrade sooner than later with open arms.\n\nThe iPhone 16 line\n\nApple’s next-generation iPhone, likely called the iPhone 16, will reportedly get relatively modest hardware upgrades. If Apple follows the same strategy it has during previous releases, the base iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get the A17 Pro chip found in last year's iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max phones, while the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will get new, more powerful processors.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Apple will bring new chips to all four iPhone models. According to a report by MacRumors, citing Haitong International Securities’ analyst Jeff Pu, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will get an improved A18 processor, while the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will get the company's A18 Pro. The iPhone 15 Pro phones are shown during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMacRumors also said the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lines will get new capacitive “Capture” buttons that could be used as physical camera buttons to, well, capture photos. The button will live on the right side of the phones below the volume buttons. Non-Pro iPhone 16 models will also get the programmable Action button previously only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will also get larger displays, jumping from 6.1 inches to 6.3 inches for the Pro and 6.7 to 6.9 inches for the Pro Max without increasing the phones’ sizes thanks to slimmer bezels, reported Gurman.\n\nThe new iPhones are also expected to bring feature camera improvements, including enhanced optical zoom capabilities on the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nDon’t expect too much more from the iPhone 16 line, though. Apple is more focused on making Apple Intelligence a success than making major changes to the iPhone's hardware. Next year’s models, however, could get a far thinner design, creating something akin to an iPhone Air, according to Gurman.\n\nApple Watch 10th anniversary\n\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of the debut of the first Apple Watch, and according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will mark the occasion by giving the watch a fresh makeover.\n\nThe 41-millimeter version of the Apple Watch will reportedly get a new 45-mm display, while the existing 45-mm option will get a larger 49-mm screen. According to Gurman, Apple was looking to add blood pressure and sleep apnea detection features to the new watches but won't be able to this year due to a mixture of technical issues and Apple's ongoing legal battle over its blood oxygen sensor.\n\nApple will also debut an updated version of the Apple Watch Ultra, though it will largely remain the same outside of a new chip.\n\nFinally, be on the lookout for upgraded versions of Apple’s entry-level and mid-range AirPods, Gurman reported. The earbuds will get updated designs and features, including active noise cancellation for the mid-range version while costing the same as the current models: $129 for the base versions and $169 for the mid-range versions. Don’t expect interchangeable silicon tips like those found on the AirPods Pro, though. Those will continue to be exclusive to the company’s pricier models.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor lost 6% during the period.\n\nNvidia's second-quarter print failed to impress the Street, triggering selloffs.\n\nMing-Chi hailed it as the beginning of the AI frenzy, citing a two—to three-fold annual growth in its equipment sales to Taiwan Semiconductor. He expects AI semiconductors to beat the global chip market growth of 8% in the last two decades.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Co-COO Y.J. Mii made similar claims at the Semicon Taiwan industry forum in Taipei this Wednesday, projecting a 50% compound growth rate for AI accelerator. Samsung Electronics' memory chip business President, Lee Jung-Bae, backed Mii’s projection at the event.\n\nRecent reports claimed Taiwan Semiconductor and its partners are fast-tracking silicon photonics for AI, targeting a $500 million market by 2028.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, also known as Foxconn reported a 33% month-over-month topline growth in August 2024, bearing testimony to the continued AI frenzy.\n\nThe results reflect a recovery from a smartphone slump, backed by demand for AI servers containing Nvidia's AI accelerators, Bloomberg reports.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock has risen over 70% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "UBS issues shopping list for investors amid tech volatility",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been going through a rout as fears of a US recession sparked a Wall Street sell-off that wiped $279bn of Nvidia (NVDA) alone in one single day. Despite the ongoing volatility, UBS (UBS) is advising investors to see this as a strategic moment to refine their technology portfolios — whether by making selective purchases or offloading certain assets.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, recommends investors assess their portfolio’s technology and AI exposure.\n\nThose with lower AI allocations might consider building exposure through structured strategies to navigate potential volatility, while those with higher allocations could explore capital preservation strategies as a hedge against further market turbulence.\n\n“Semiconductor capital expenditure remains promising,” Haefele noted, though he acknowledged that some areas of the industry are more appealing than others. Nvidia's recent earnings, which exceeded consensus estimates but fell short of loftier expectations, sent mixed signals to investors.\n\nRead more: BP and L&G shares favourite among Fidelity investors as tech appetite fades\n\nHowever, Haefele pointed out that the broader semiconductor sector could find support in the coming quarters due to robust order books and an expected increase in AI-related capital expenditures, which, despite their recent growth, are still below historical peaks.\n\nUBS suggests a targeted approach within the semiconductor space, prioritising AI logic chips where valuations have become more reasonable. Quality foundry stocks also appear attractive, with UBS expecting sustained earnings growth.\n\nAt the other end of the sector, memory chip stocks, which are typically more volatile, may struggle in the current market and face heightened regulatory risks from the US. Chip manufacturing equipment makers, heavily reliant on revenue from China, are seen as the most vulnerable in the near term due to increasing export restrictions.\n\nLooking beyond semiconductors, UBS sees potential in quality large-cap technology companies, particularly those that are beginning to show returns from AI investments. While sentiment around large-cap tech has softened, second-quarter results were solid, and global tech earnings growth is projected to reach 15% to 20% over the next six quarters.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are leading the way in AI monetisation, with Microsoft anticipating faster cloud revenue growth and Meta aligning its investments with substantial monetisation opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Investors buying the dip as Wall Street rout makes stocks cheaper\n\nValuations for mega-cap tech stocks have also become more attractive, currently trading at around 27 times next year’s earnings — approximately 15% below their recent peaks. UBS maintains a preference for quality tech companies with strong secular growth and resilient earnings, supported by solid fundamentals and robust free cash flow.\n\nIn the smartphone sector, supply chains may see a boost from the upcoming replacement cycle. Apple (AAPL), in particular, has shown relative resilience, with its shares holding up well ahead of the seasonal iPhone launch. UBS notes that supply chain checks suggest a launch preparation in line with last year, with the potential for a 5% to 10% increase in orders if demand is strong.\n\nUBS favours companies within the smartphone supply chain that have pricing power and industry leadership while remaining cautious on lower-quality hardware firms that could face margin pressures.\n\nUBS says that tech volatility is likely to persist in the near term but remains confident in the long-term investment case for AI.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Can Help Supercharge Your Portfolio. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Over the long term, the S&P 500 has produced an annualized return of about 10% per year. For the individual investor who wants to pick single businesses, perhaps the obvious goal is to outperform the broader index over the long haul.\n\nThis might seem like a daunting task, as even most active fund managers lose to the market. But I believe average investors can supercharge their returns by focusing on one important characteristic. These stocks are proof that this strategy has merit.\n\nThink like a customer\n\nAs individual investors, we might forget that we have valuable first-hand knowledge of some businesses out there. That's because we are also customers of many companies. It's by using this perspective and identifying businesses that do a fantastic job at taking care of their customers, by offering superior products or services, that we can find potential stock ideas.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the customers that generate revenue for companies. There is no argument here. This ultimately leads to profits and cash flows, which can result in happy shareholders.\n\nLook at these five stocks\n\nIf you adopt this mental framework, then it's actually quite easy to find businesses that delight their customers. I've chosen five obvious examples.\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST)is loved by its shoppers, who can't get enough of the low prices and treasure hunt experience. The worldwide membership renewal rate of over 90% exemplifies customer loyalty. It's also worth mentioning that the number of member households has climbed 40% in the past five years. In the past decade, this top retail stock has generated a total return of 807%.\n\nThe restaurant industry is extremely competitive, but Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has found remarkable success by focusing on real ingredients, having a simple menu, and providing customers with tremendous value. This is especially true following the health scare in 2015, when the business regained the trust of consumers and investors. Shares are up 226% in the past five years, propelled partly by 114% sales growth during that time. Image source: Amazon.\n\nCompanies in the tech sector also stand out. Just look at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), which disrupted the media industry with its streaming service that now has 278 million global subscribers. The business provided a much better viewer experience at a lower price point than traditional cable TV.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos was the first to publicly mention in the company's 1997 shareholder letter that obsessing over the customer was a top strategic priority. The business' Prime membership is wildly successful, providing fast and free shipping on millions of items, in addition to other valuable perks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen there's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which sells some of the most in-demand products the world has ever seen. The company's seamless combination of hardware and software creates a powerful ecosystem that essentially locks customers in, bolstered by an active installed base of more than 2.2 billion. Historically, Apple has been able to flex its pricing power, by introducing new devices at fixed price points while offering older models at a discount -- an offer consumers often found too tempting to pass up.\n\nInvestors won't find a lot of investments that fared better than these three. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple have seen their shares soar 933%, 899%, and 768%, respectively, in the past 10 years.\n\nPay the right price\n\nThese five stocks are the perfect example of companies that continue to focus on serving the needs of their customers. Investors can look around and find other businesses doing the same thing. It's another filter to add to your analysis toolkit to use before making an investment decision.\n\nBut to be clear, the previously mentioned stocks aren't automatic buys today. Valuation is another important factor to consider. Looking at the popular forward price-to-earnings ratio in relation to other variables, namely growth potential, I believe investors should wait for a pullback before thinking about buying Costco, Chipotle, and Apple. Netflix and Amazon, on the other hand, look like better buying opportunities at the moment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 719% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 162% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 3, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "By Hannah Lang\n\n(Reuters) - PayPal is expanding into U.S. point-of-sale payments by integrating its debit card with Apple's mobile wallet and offering cashback rewards, as the global online payments giant seeks direct competition with tech companies and banks.\n\nThe bid to grab a slice of in-person purchases at stores, cafes and restaurants is part of an ambitious turnaround strategy by new CEO Alex Chriss who joined the company from Intuit last year.\n\nWhile PayPal has long dominated online payments and peer-to-peer payments via its Venmo app, it has not pushed consumers to use its products in person.\n\n\"E-commerce has obviously been one of the fastest growing areas where people are spending their dollars... but it's not everything,\" Chriss said. \"Now consumers can use PayPal for every purchase, everywhere, every time.\"\n\nThe push into point-of-sales includes 5% cash back for certain products up to $1,000 per month and additional rewards from brands like DoorDash and Sephora.\n\nThe value of U.S. debit card payments has jumped in recent years, reaching $4.55 trillion in 2021 up from $2.47 trillion in 2015, according to recent U.S. Federal Reserve data.\n\nChriss said consumers are becoming increasingly cost-conscious and moving towards debit cards, which allow them to keep within their spending limits.\n\nPayPal will also allow customers to use debit cards with Apple Pay, as users take advantage of mobile wallets and \"tap to pay\" options.\n\nThat makes it among the more competitive debit card cash-back products with only 24% of debit cardholders reporting earning cash-back rewards in 2023, compared with 74% of credit cardholders, a report from purchase rewards firm Valuedynamx showed.\n\nWhile PayPal has enjoyed a long-held first mover advantage, increasing competition from Apple and Google have taken some share in mobile payments, according to analysts.\n\nAs part of the push, the company is making its largest-ever marketing investment to promote using PayPal in person. PayPal declined to disclose amount of that investment, but flagged in its quarterly earnings that marketing and brand campaigns would push up expenses in the second half of the year.\n\nChriss has called 2024 a \"transition year\" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume. In January, PayPal launched artificial intelligence-driven products and a one-click checkout feature.\n\nPayPal's stock price is up more than 17% since the beginning of the year, but still trails benchmark S&P 500 index's 22% gain.\n\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in New York; Editing by Michelle Price and Sam Holmes)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s revenue rose 33% in August, accelerating from the previous month thanks to demand for servers powering AI applications.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\n\nApple Inc.’s main manufacturing partner, also known as Foxconn, reported sales of NT$548.3 billion ($17.1 billion) — a record for the month of August. That pace was up sharply from growth of 22% in July.\n\nFoxconn’s topline has begun to recover from a protracted smartphone slump, helped by a growing business supplying data center operators with servers containing Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerators. Last month, it said it expects revenue to grow over the rest of year, reversing successive quarterly declines. The company’s shares are up close to 70% in 2024.\n\nSome investors preach caution. Nvidia reported earnings that failed to live up to expectations, triggering a record selloff. And analysts have issued fresh warnings that AI’s potential is thus far largely untested and unproven.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nNvidia’s clarification of its scheduled production ramp-up of Blackwell, its next-generation AI GPU platform, in late 2024 helps remove uncertainty over likely growth of the AI server supply chain next year. Despite very limited contribution of the new chips this year, major ODMs such as Hon Hai, Quanta and Wiwynn are set to post triple-digit growth in AI server sales with stellar shipments of systems featuring Hopper chips, Nvidia’s current mainstream platform, in 2H24.\n\n— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nStill, Hon Hai has set itself the goal of securing 40% of the global AI server market, relying on relationships with many of the world’s biggest tech companies and its own manufacturing expertise.\n\nThe Taiwanese company also benefits from consumer electronics demand, and the addition of AI features and enhancements may encourage mobile users to upgrade their devices. Shipments of the iPhone in China have in recent months have bounced back, and the global smartphone market is recovering. Apple is preparing to unveil the iPhone 16 next week.\n\n“Entering the peak season in the second half of the year, we anticipate our operation to gradually gain momentum,” the company said in a statement.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show La justicia no viene al caso en las cortes de inmigración de EE.UU.

        "content": "Dell Technologies (DELL) founder and CEO Michael Dell thinks talk of an AI spending letdown is way overblown.\n\n\"There always are bumps in the road as you launch a rocket and create new capabilities. You have new product cycles. You have new introductions of things. And some customers want the existing one faster. Some want to wait for the new one. We have all the above,\" Dell told Yahoo Finance at the Citi TMT conference in New York City on Wednesday.\n\n\"But the macro picture here is very, very clear, and that is that there's enormous demand. It's growing. It's expanding out from the hyperscalers to the service providers to enterprise to commercial to sovereign AI to embedded AI to the edge to retail to manufacturing to your PC to here, there, and everywhere,\" he added.\n\nDell's second quarter underscored why the tech titan's stock has gained an impressive 45% year to date, in part as it's seen as a key player in the build-out of America's AI infrastructure.\n\nThe company said it secured $3.1 billion of AI server sales in the quarter, almost double the $1.7 billion netted in the preceding quarter.\n\nSales in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) surged 38% to $11.65 billion. AI sales are captured in the ISG segment.\n\nDell's Client Solutions Group — which includes sales of PCs and laptops — saw sales drop 4% to $12.41 billion. Consumer sales declined 22% to $1.86 billion, while the commercial business was flat at $10.6 billion.\n\n\"What organizations are seeing is this is a historic opportunity to make their businesses way more productive and efficient, while at the same time, kind of reimagining them given all this capability,\" Dell, who first started the company in 1984, said.\n\nBy and large, the Street remains bullish on Dell's stock due to its AI exposure and because it looks too cheap to ignore.\n\n\"Combining the revenue opportunity [for AI] over the medium-term — which increases visibility into double-digit revenue growth for the core business, and the continued focus on operating expenses, we see a robust earnings growth trajectory [for Dell] which is not fully appreciated in the 13x P/E multiple the shares are trading at currently,\" said JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.\n\nChatterjee reiterated an Overweight rating on Dell shares, the equivalent of a Buy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\n\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug​.\n\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon’s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company’s total sales​. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure​. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Citi investment bank recently named the company as the top artificial intelligence stock pick heading into 2025. In a note to investors, the bank’s AI analysts pointed out that early developer feedback on iOS 18 — the latest iPhone software featuring beta AI capabilities — has been positive. Notably, the newly launched AI-powered feature that removes unwanted objects has received favorable reviews. According to the analysts, these innovations give consumers a strong incentive to upgrade their iPhones. The investor note also addressed concerns about the transition to a new CFO and the ongoing antitrust case against Google, expressing confidence that the company will emerge stronger from these challenges.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is potentially participating in a funding round for OpenAI, the California-based AI startup that is estimated to be worth around $100 billion, later this year. Experts are divided on the reasons behind the tech giant's possible investment in OpenAI. According to an analysis by Bank of America, a deeper Apple-OpenAI partnership could be in the works if Apple makes a substantial investment, potentially positioning itself as a rival to Google in the internet search arena.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone launch event on Monday, Sept. 9, at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nCEO Tim Cook is expected to headline the keynote, which will reportedly include the debut of the iPhone 16 lineup, the 10th anniversary edition of the Apple Watch, and updated AirPods.\n\nThat’s a lot of hardware, but Wall Street isn’t banking on new iPhones or special edition Apple Watches to move the company’s stock price. Instead, all eyes will be on Apple’s generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence platform.\n\nApple Intelligence is the company’s big swing at bringing generative AI capabilities to consumers’ iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Wall Street wasn’t very keen on how long it took Apple to announce its AI initiative, waiting impatiently as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted their own AI services for enterprises and consumers.\n\nBut investors changed their tune when Apple showed off Apple Intelligence at its WWDC developer conference in June, sending the company’s stock price up around 15% and putting it ahead of Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Google for year-to-date performance. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC) in Cupertino, Calif., on June 10, 2024. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images) (NIC COURY via Getty Images)\n\nApple is setting up Apple Intelligence as one of the main selling points for its latest phones, as its software will only run on last year’s iPhone 15 Pro or newer phones. And analysts are banking on that exclusivity to reinvigorate iPhone sales.\n\n“Apple Intelligence remains the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle, and we expect Apple's… event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\n\nBut Apple Intelligence could prove to be something more important than a catalyst for iPhone sales. It will also serve as a make-or-break moment for generative AI in the eyes of everyday consumers.\n\nApple’s AI opportunity\n\nTake one look at Apple’s invitation for its Sept. 9 show, and it’s clear the company is going all in on AI. From the “It’s Glowtime” tagline to the multicolor Apple logo meant to evoke Siri’s revamped look, the company is sending the message that this show will be an AI showcase.\n\nApple is pouring AI into its software products with features that summarize text message threads, surface priority emails in the Mail app, provide an improved Siri experience, and enable access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nApple is also including AI staples like writing tools to help gussy up your emails and documents by proofreading your text or reworking it to sound more professional or concise. The company is also expecting developers to jump on board the AI train, building out new apps that take advantage of the technology through Apple’s devices.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We estimate this could result in incremental Services high margin growth annually of $10 billion for Apple as this all kicks in and will be the start of a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream that is both hardware and software driven,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.\n\n“We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front,” Ives added. And with that, a $30 to $40 per share bump — pushing the company’s market cap to the $4 trillion mark.\n\nApple isn’t the only company to bring generative AI to its smartphone line. Samsung has Galaxy AI software, combining its own AI with some of Google’s AI smarts. Google also offers its own Gemini AI platform via its new Pixel 9 line of devices, including its Pixel 9 Pro Fold foldable phone.\n\nApple, however, has done a far better job explaining its AI offerings than either of its competitors. It made the software seem like a must-have for users during its June developer conference, explaining how it integrates across the company’s various apps and services in a way that Samsung and Google haven’t been able to by making AI seem more personal.\n\nThe AI risk\n\nBut Apple is going to have to do more than that to get people excited about its AI efforts. I’ve been using Apple’s beta software on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and while I appreciate its ability to summarize long text message threads between friends — no one likes having to sift through 40 messages to find out what they’re doing for dinner — and find the priority email feature in Mail helpful, it’s difficult to say whether that will be enough to spark consumer interest in the technology.\n\nApple will also need to take great care to ensure that its Apple Intelligence is accurate and not prone to the kinds of hallucinations that have led to criticisms of AI software like Google’s AI Overview, which famously told people to add glue to their pizza and to eat rocks.\n\nAbove all, Apple will need to ensure that Apple Intelligence is something that consumers actually want to use and not a feature the company had to shoehorn into its portfolio to placate investors fearing Apple would miss the boat on the next tech hype train.

        "content": "Apple's Glowtime Event: Will The iPhone 16 Shine Or Fizzle?\n\nApple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) much-anticipated “It’s Glowtime” event on Sept. 9 has the tech world buzzing, but analysts are playing it cool. With expectations for an iPhone 16, updated Apple Watches and AirPods, investors are curious if this event will light up Apple's stock or leave it dim.\n\nGoldman Sachs On iPhone Product Innovations\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng remains optimistic about Apple’s long-term prospects, reiterating a Buy rating and a 12-month price target of $276, reflecting 23.9% upside expectations for the stock.\n\nApple stock generally underperforms the broad market on the day of iPhone announcements, the analyst said. While the Monday event may be “similarly immaterial to the stock price,” potential upside surprises could come from “the announcement of a price increase on iPhones,” “earlier-than-expected AI features and apps” and “better-than-expected carrier promotions,” he said.\n\nNg is particularly bullish on the new product innovation in the iPhone 16, expecting it to drive “upgrades and installed base growth,” with iPhone revenue growth forecasted to accelerate to 9% in both FY2025 and FY2026, driven by “AI features and new iPhone hardware form factors.”\n\nRead Also: Apple, Nvidia Will Lead 3-To-5-Year Tech Bull Run, Analyst Says: ‘I Am A Buyer Here’\n\nPiper Sandler: ‘Apple Intelligence Can Be The Star Of The Show’\n\nOn the other hand, Piper Sandler analyst Matt Farrell takes a more cautious stance, maintaining a Neutral rating with a price target of $225.\n\nFarrell expresses concern that “a lot of the near-term excitement is built into the stock at ~30x CY25E EPS.” The event could be significant if “Apple Intelligence can be the ‘star of the show,'” which would be an “incremental positive for the ‘super cycle’ thesis,” the analyst said.\n\nPiper Sandler is wary of any major price increases for the iPhone 16, noting that “any major price increase this cycle would be viewed as a negative,” particularly as consumer spending shows signs of weakening, he said.\n\nApple’s Glowtime Event Expectations — A Mixed Bag\n\nAs Apple gears up for its Glowtime event, the consensus among analysts is that while the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence have the potential to impress, there's caution in the air.\n\nNg's optimism hinges on the possibility of surprise announcements, while Farrell remains skeptical, focusing on potential headwinds like consumer spending and the lack of revolutionary changes.\n\nInvestors will be watching closely to see if Apple can truly shine or if this event will be more of a slow burn.\n\nRead Next:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Apple’s iPhone 16 Launch Will Be ‘Disappointment Before The Excitement,’ Gene Munster Says\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto courtesy of Apple.\n\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Equal-Weight Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Strong Buy Jan 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple's Glowtime Event: Will The iPhone 16 Shine Or Fizzle? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Bets on AI Growth Surge, Samsung Joins AI Optimism In Trade Show\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) senior officials expressed their conviction on artificial intelligence prospects at the Semicon Taiwan industry forum in Taipei on Wednesday, as per Reuters.\n\nIn July, Samsung reported its highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022, driven by its chip division. According to analysts, Taiwan Semiconductor raised its full-year revenue forecast backed by AI frenzy and seasonal smartphone demand for both 3nm and 5nm. It is a key supplier to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Co-COO Y.J. Mii told Reuters that AI remained a major growth driver, projecting a 50% compound growth rate for AI accelerator for the next couple of years despite taking a toll on global jobs.\n\nSamsung Electronics’ memory chip business President, Lee Jung-Bae, voiced a similar opinion about AI.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor led the global foundry market, commanding a 62% share in the second quarter of 2024, followed by Samsung Electronics, which had a 3% share.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock gained 70% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NASDAQ:TDIV) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research can be a valuable source of information for learning about a company's fundamentals. Analysts create financial models based on the fundamentals and expected future earnings of a company to arrive at a price target and recommendation for the stock.\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor have an average 1-year price target of $224.29, representing an expected upside of 37.62%.\n\nBecause of differences in assumptions, analysts can arrive at very different price targets and recommendations. No analysts have bearish recommendations on Taiwan Semiconductor, while 7 analysts have bullish ratings. The street high price target from Susquehanna is $250.0, while the street low from Bernstein is $200.0.\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock traded higher by 1.16% at $162.38 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Taiwan Semiconductor Bets on AI Growth Surge, Samsung Joins AI Optimism In Trade Show originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "iPhone 16's lack of Apple Intelligence in China leaves market open to rivals like Huawei",
        "content": "Apple's iPhone 16 launch is clouded in China by competitive pressure from local players and uncertainty over when the country might get access to its Apple Intelligence feature, according to analysts.\n\nHours after the US consumer electronics giant is expected to launch its iPhone 16 line-up on September 9, California time, Huawei Technologies will have its own event, where it is expected to unveil its 'tri-fold' smartphone with two hinges. Richard Yu Chengdong, the chairman of Huawei's global business group, said the company will launch \"the most leading, innovative, and disruptive\" product at the event scheduled for September 10, China time.\n\nApple has already been facing mounting pressure in China, one of the company's most important markets, and recently fell out of the top five vendors by shipments. Its challenges could be exacerbated with the iPhone 16 given uncertainty around its ability to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. The built-in artificial intelligence (AI) is powered in part by OpenAI's GPT large language models (LLMs), which cannot be made commercially available in China.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"iPhone will continue to see erosion [of its market share] in the premium segment by Huawei and other Chinese brands,\" said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at consultancy Counterpoint Research.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman in the audience during the 2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California, on June 10, 2024. Photo: EPA-EFE alt=OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in the audience during the 2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California, on June 10, 2024. Photo: EPA-EFE>\n\nApple saw its sales dip 5.7 per cent in the Chinese market in the second quarter despite an overall 6 per cent sales increase over the period owing to recovering consumer demand, according to Counterpoint data.\n\nAll major Chinese smartphone brands managed to grow their businesses over the period except for Oppo, whose sales declined by nearly 10 per cent. Huawei had the biggest gain for the quarter, growing more than 44 per cent, thanks to the roll-out of its Pura 70 and Nova 12 series.\n\nChina has kept tight control over which generative AI products can be made available to the public, requiring that models be registered with a central regulator for approval before services go live. China to date has approved more than 180 GenAI products, all of which are developed by local firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Intelligence is meant to give an overhaul of the company's virtual assistant, Siri, giving it better context awareness and allowing it to offer better answers to user queries. Other AI features include helping users draft emails and edit images.\n\nSome companies partnered with local providers to offer AI services on their devices. Samsung Electronics is using Baidu's Ernie LLM for its Galaxy phones.\n\nApple has so far given no indication of how it plans to offer AI in China. This could potentially leave Apple at a disadvantage as smartphone companies race to integrate AI, according to Lucas Zhong, an analyst at Canalys.\n\nDespite the uncertain timeline, though, Zhong said that Apple's prioritisation of privacy could make its own in-house LLM - which it uses in addition to GPT - among the most likely of foreign AI models to get regulatory approval in the country.\n\nCounterpoint's Lam said pent-up demand from people looking to upgrade their iPhones may still help drive sales of the new handsets in China. Sales could be \"slightly higher\" in the second half of 2024 compared with a year ago, he added.\n\nIan Ma, a financial professional in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone 14 Pro Max, said he is interested in the iPhone 16, regardless of its AI capabilities. A number of Chinese iPhone users even mused on social media about buying overseas models to get access to Apple Intelligence, although software features are typically made available according to the country associated with the Apple ID account.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Apple rally fueled by AI promises approaches a crucial test",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s upcoming iPhone release has sent its stock price soaring because of promised artificial-intelligence features. Those gains appear vulnerable, at least in the short term, if history is any guide.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine Dense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds\n\nThe company’s stock typically underperforms after iPhone launches, a cautious precedent when expectations are sky-high and Apple’s share price relative to earnings is quite rich — leaving little room for error.\n\nApple shares have dropped on 12 of the 17 iPhone launch days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Also, September has been the worst month for Apple shares over the past decade, falling an average of 3.2% during that time. That tracks a broader trend, as both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also experience their their biggest percentage losses in the month, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac.\n\nIf the newest iPhone does not live up to expectations in terms of product features or sales, Apple could see a repeat of those valuation doldrums.\n\n“You can easily envision a scenario where the market has built up all this enthusiasm, but then it has to bide time before we get concrete evidence Apple’s AI strategy is working,” said Denny Fish, who manages the $7 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology and Innovation Fund. “While there’s a desire for AI features, there’s room for skepticism and the multiple is at the high end,” he added. “That’s generally not a great time to buy.”\n\nThe company will hold a product announcement event on Sept. 9. Bloomberg News recently reported that the latest phones will go on sale Sept. 20, though the AI features won’t be rolled out until October, through software updates.\n\nApple shares have risen 39% off an April low. The move has added more than $900 billion to its market capitalization and contributed 22.6% of the Nasdaq 100 Index’s total gain over that period, more than any other component, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nApple’s stock is valued at 31 times estimated earnings, more than a 50% premium to its 10-year average multiple. Last month the revenue multiple touched 8.8, its highest going back to at least 2000.\n\nOptimism over its AI strategy has been a central driver of the rally. Citi named Apple its top AI pick for 2025, and Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC recently took a position, writing in an investor letter that “AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth at Apple has been in short supply for a while. Revenue has fallen in five of the past seven quarters, and analysts predict it will rise just 1.8% in its 2024 fiscal year before accelerating to 7.9% growth the following year. In contrast, the overall S&P 500 tech sector is expected to grow revenue 10.9% in 2024 and 12.7% in 2025, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nIronically, growth has been tepid because of iPhone improvements. Customers have been holding onto their phones for longer, because cameras and batteries have gotten better and more expensive, leaving little reason to splurge on a new model.\n\nBecause of how important the iPhone is to Apple’s product suite — accounting for almost half of revenue last quarter — Wall Street is betting the nifty AI features will nudge more customers to upgrade, spurring an acceleration in growth.\n\nThe pool of users who might be in the market for a new iPhone is potentially massive. Over 40% of Apple’s 800 million-plus smartphone devices are iPhone 12 or older, with another 27% of users on an iPhone 13, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fewer than 10% of current users have phones that can be upgraded to the AI software.\n\nHowever, a July BI survey of US smartphone consumers indicated AI may not be enough to spur upgrades, which would put Apple’s rally at risk.\n\nMoffettNathanson recently started coverage on the stock with a neutral rating, writing that the valuation implies “an iPhone upgrade cycle significantly larger than the 5G upgrade cycle of 2021/22,” which the firm is skeptical Apple can achieve, especially given the interest-rate backdrop.\n\nDespite the risk, there continues to be a lot of optimism about what AI will mean for Apple’s long-term growth, and the upgrade cycle is expected to play out over a number of years.\n\nEven if there’s a selloff around the new iPhone release, it will deliver revenue and earnings over time, which can build momentum for shares, said Eric Johnston, chief equity and macro strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n“The multiple is clearly lofty right now, but expensive names can stay expensive if the momentum is there,” he said. “I think that will be the case for Apple.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIntel Corp. shares jumped 9.5% on Friday, their biggest one-day percentage gain since October 2022. The rally came after Bloomberg News reported that the company is discussing various scenarios, including a split of its product-design and manufacturing businesses. Despite the pop, the chipmaker still fell nearly 30% over the month of August, with much of the weakness coming in the wake of another disappointing quarterly report. Shares are down 56% this year.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nBain Capital aims to buy out Fuji Soft Inc. for more than 600 billion yen ($4.1 billion), a surprise bid that sets up a rare Japanese takeover battle with private equity rival KKR & Co. South Korean startup Rebellions Inc. is planning to go public as early as the end of 2025, seeking to capitalize on booming demand for the chips used to power generative AI. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said it intends to pursue the $4 billion damages claim in London against the estate of the recently deceased British tech tycoon Mike Lynch.

        "content": "UK investors are flocking to passive funds as only two of Interactive Investor top 10 most-bought investments in August are active funds in a list where Nvidia (NVDA) is the most bought stock.\n\nFundsmith Equity (0P0000RU81.L) has dropped from the top 10 for the first time since Interactive Investor began tracking its most-bought investments in 2018. Manager Terry Smith faces the headwinds of global stock market returns being heavily influenced by a small number of US technology companies.\n\nVanguard (VUSA.L) passive funds took the lead, with the asset manager taking five of the top 10 slots. The only active funds that made it into the top 10 in August were the Royal London Short Term Money Market (0P0000NRQO.L) and Jupiter India (0P00018LFD.L).\n\nThe L&G Global Technology Index Trust (0P0000XAFS.L) was the most bought investment last month on the platform as “many investors are positioning themselves for technology shares to continue their fine form”, Kyle Caldwell, funds and investment education editor at Interactive Investor, said.\n\nIn second place is Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% Equity (0P0000TKZM.L) and Royal London Short Term Money Market came in third.\n\nLooking at the top stocks, August proved to be a turbulent month for equities, with volatility sweeping across markets. Among the companies navigating this choppy environment was Nvidia, which released its latest quarterly update during the month.\n\nDespite the semiconductor giant surpassing analysts’ expectations, the heightened market volatility led to a decline in its share price. Nevertheless, Nvidia continued to be the favoured pick among investors, maintaining its position as the top choice in the US market.\n\nIn contrast, Tesla (TSLA), once a stalwart in the rankings, saw its fortunes shift dramatically. The electric vehicle manufacturer reported disappointing Q2 2024 earnings, which triggered a sharp reassessment by investors. As a result, Tesla plummeted out of the top 10 list entirely in August, a significant drop from its third-place standing in July.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Nvidia, Rolls-Royce, Tesla and Intel\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and HSBC (HSBA.L) made their way onto the list, signalling renewed investor interest. Moving in the opposite direction, easyJet (EZJ.L), which had previously been a popular choice, dropped out of the rankings.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “August started shakily and ended strongly, providing some buying opportunities as the month progressed either to add to holdings or to buy on the dip, and ii [Interactive Investor] customers took full advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\n“At the centre of the volatility was the US market darling Nvidia, which not only was at the centre of a technology tempest but also reported its latest quarterly update which, despite beating expectations, resulted in a fall in the share price. However, this was not enough to deter investors – for ii [Interactive Investor] the stock remains top of the most bought .”\n\nIn the UK, familiar names dominated the scene. Rolls-Royce (RR.L) continued to be a favourite among investors, adding 7% in August, bringing its total gain for the year to 66%.\n\nAdditionally, income-generating stocks remained in strong demand. Legal & General (LGEN.L), which also reported earnings in August, boasts a dividend yield of 9.2% and was accompanied by other high-yielding stocks such as BP (BP.L) (5.3%), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) (5%), HSBC (7%, rising to 9.4% with special dividends), and Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (7%).\n\nCaldwell looked at Fundsmith Equity and said that although it has outperformed the wider global market since it launched in November 2010, its performance has lagged over the past couple of years.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks crawl higher ahead of manufacturing data\n\n“Fundsmith Equity manager Terry Smith, like other professional investors, is continuing to face into the headwind of global stock market returns being heavily influenced by a small number of US technology companies,” he said.\n\n“Many investors are positioning themselves for technology shares to continue their fine form. L&G Technology Index retains its place as the most-bought fund. It has large positions, just over 40% of the fund, in Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. Therefore, holding this fund could spell trouble for investors who are overexposed to technology should there be a sharp correction,” he added.\n\nThe fund has only grown 6.8% over the last three years compared to an IA Global index growth of 11.5%.\n\nIn trusts, Scottish Mortgage (SMT.L) continued in its widespread popularity, but other tech trusts like Polar Capital Technology (PCT.L) and Allianz Technology (ATT.L) continued their long-running strength.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors will be pleased with their fantastic 342% return over the last five years",
        "content": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. Don't believe it? Then look at the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price. It's 328% higher than it was five years ago. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 34% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this freereport showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Apple's TSR for the last 5 years was 342%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nApple provided a TSR of 21% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 35% a year, over half a decade) look better. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Huawei Technologies is expected to debut the world's first \"tri-fold\" smartphone within hours of Apple's iPhone 16 launch event on September 10, teeing up a head-to-head competition as the Chinese technology giant snaps up more market share at home.\n\nHuawei announced the event on Monday with a post to microblogging platform Weibo, featuring a Z-shaped image that resembles the dual-hinged handset it has been developing. Richard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei's consumer business group, said in a Weibo repost that Huawei's \"most leading, innovative and disruptive product\" is coming.\n\nThe executive has recently been spotted using the two-creased device in public, according to pictures circulating on Chinese social media.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe launch will take place shortly after Apple concludes the \"It's Glowtime\" event it has scheduled that day, when the world's most valuable company is expected to launch the artificial intelligence-equipped iPhone 16 series phones. Huawei's competition with Apple in China has taken on new significance as the US-sanctioned telecoms equipment maker has seen its smartphone sales surge while iPhone sales in China have struggled comparatively.\n\nImages of Richard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei Technologies' consumer business group, have circulated online showing him using what appears to be a dual-hinged foldable smartphone. Photo: Weibo / 极客视线 alt=Images of Richard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei Technologies' consumer business group, have circulated online showing him using what appears to be a dual-hinged foldable smartphone. Photo: Weibo / 极客视线>\n\nHuawei did not reveal details about the new product in its announcement, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\n\"Huawei's strategic decision to launch its advanced tri-fold smartphone immediately following Apple's launch demonstrates a well-thought-out and astute move,\" Abhilash Kumar, analyst at TechInsights, said on X, formerly Twitter. \"A longer interval between the two launches could have resulted in a substantial number of consumers committing to the iPhone 16 series, making it less likely for them to consider Huawei's tri-fold device.\"\n\nIn a separate Weibo post on Tuesday, Huawei's Yu revealed that the company's anticipated device will be called the Mate XT, under the luxury product line Ultimate Design. The Mate branding is used for a line of Huawei's flagship devices that includes last year's Mate 60 Pro, which was the beginning of the company's resurgence in China owing to its China-made processor with a 7-nanometre chip that appeared to defy US sanctions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince that launch and Huawei's following Pura 70 line launched in April, Apple has faced mounting challenges in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nWhile Apple still topped the premium segment, which consists of handsets priced over US$600, its market share dropped to 58 per cent in the March quarter from 70 per cent a year earlier, according to IDC data. Huawei's share in the high-end market jumped to 20 per cent that quarter, up from 12 per cent a year earlier.\n\nApple fell out of the top five smartphone vendors in China by shipments in the second quarter, according to market analytics firm Canalys.\n\nHuawei has long been reported to be preparing a foldable smartphone with three sections, according to Chinese media. Yu said in a live-streamed interview in July that the company has been working on \"the next generation of foldable phones\" for the past five years.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company filed a patent for a dual-hinged device in 2022, according to records from the China National Intellectual Property Administration.\n\nIn the first quarter, Huawei beat Samsung Electronics to become the world's bestselling foldable smartphone brand with a 35 per cent market share, as the South Korean brand slipped to 23 per cent of the market, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Huawei's sales still primarily depend on China, however, as restrictions on accessing US technology such as Google services have limited the appeal of its products overseas.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among ChatGPT’s Recent Stock Recommendations",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\n\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\n\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\n\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\n\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data—not too hot, not too cold—that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\n\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on  “historical trends” and the “market landscape” from various sectors which have “substantial” potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered a strong third-quarter performance, despite weaker-than-expected sales in China. While the company's China sales declined by 6.5% year-over-year, the overall results exceeded Wall Street expectations. According to Toni Sacconaghi, the quarter was \"clean,\" with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) slightly surpassing estimates and providing modestly optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter.\n\nDan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research, Wedbush Securities maintains a bullish stance, describing the company’s performance as \"good enough for now.\" With the iPhone 16 cycle yet to begin, Ives sees strong potential, especially as Apple’s services sector remains robust and China begins to turn into a tailwind for the company. He rates Apple’s position as highly favorable, predicting the stock will continue to perform well, particularly as the company enters what he terms an AI-driven super cycle with the upcoming iPhone 16.\n\nRecently, Ben, Head of Technology Research, provided insights into Apple’s future. Despite Buffett’s sales, he remains optimistic about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing a \"generational upgrade cycle\" as a key driver. Ben highlighted that Apple's user base is aging, creating significant potential for new upgrades, especially with the integration of Apple Intelligence, which is exclusive to newer models.\n\nConcerns exist about whether Apple Intelligence will substantially impact the upgrade cycle, particularly if its benefits are limited to higher-end phones. However, Ben projects that Apple's earnings could exceed $9 per share in a bull case scenario, potentially approaching $10. Historical data shows that iPhone growth can surpass 20%, and while current expectations are modest—mid-single digits for iPhone sales this year and next—Ben believes these are achievable. He anticipates a gradual but positive upgrade cycle peaking around 2026, which should be an improvement over recent stagnation.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘Creating A Whole New Level Of Stable Earnings’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Must-Watch Stocks Today.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other must-watch stocks according to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer recently discussed Nvidia’s latest earnings report on Mad Money. Despite a solid quarter, the company did not exceed the high expectations set by investors and failed to deliver its key products quickly enough to sustain its previous extraordinary performance. This disappointment led to a relatively muted market reaction, with only modest movements in major indices.\n\n\"Turns out that the company is mortal after all. Even though it reported a great quarter last night, it wasn’t able to deliver its key product fast enough to allow the company to do what it’s done so many times before: blow away earnings and raise forecasts to unfathomable levels. The company didn’t define today’s trading because it failed to dazzle in the way that so many money managers had come to expect. The major indices didn’t move much—the Dow advanced 244 points, the S&P was basically flat, and the NASDAQ dipped just 0.23%.\"\n\nCramer expressed relief that the company’s quarter brought an end to the unrealistic expectations that had surrounded the stock. He emphasized that the company is not a miracle company but a firm specializing in high-performance chips that enhance productivity and problem-solving. Cramer noted that the market had unfairly elevated the company to a status where it was expected to perform miraculous feats beyond its actual capabilities.\n\n\"My response to all this? Goodness gracious! With this quarter’s results, the albatross of perfection is now gone; the millstone has been shredded. As much as I love the company, I’m thrilled that we can finally return to a market where there are many important stocks representing many important trends, rather than just one stock capturing the attention of legions of investors—many of whom have no idea what it does, let alone where it fits into the technological food chain.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that, in the end, the company isn’t a concept; it’s not a cult; it’s not a miracle maker. It’s a company that designs incredibly fast chips that enable rapid calculations to help companies speed up problem-solving and improve productivity. You can’t ask the company’s Blackwell chip to cure cancer or put a man on Mars, and it certainly can’t bring about world peace. Yet, when you look at how this stock was trading in recent weeks, the market was basically asking CEO Jensen Huang to do all these things and more.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe believes the company should be held as an investment, not traded based on fluctuating expectations. While acknowledging that the stock had become overvalued before the quarter, Cramer maintains his belief in the company’s value.\n\n\"Right now, it looks like the company can expand customer gross margins—important but not earth-shaking, especially since the enterprise is the client, not you; you won’t even see it. Now that this quarter is in the rearview mirror, my hope is that those who wagered on the stock, rather than invested in the company, will finally move on. No more exacting comparisons with AMD, please. We need to go back to a world where we value the company like any other company, with a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple based on its growth.\"\n\nJim Cramer also addressed the question of whether AI investments are yielding tangible returns, especially in terms of improving gross margins. He noted that many of the most convincing AI applications have taken time to develop. Early investment in AI often focuses on training models, and only after this stage can AI start delivering practical benefits. Cramer emphasized that AI's most significant impacts are typically in enterprise settings rather than for individual consumers.\n\n\"For the skeptics, the most compelling AI use cases have been slow to develop. Much of the early investment goes toward training AI models. Only after this process comes to fruition can artificial intelligence actually do something useful for users. It's important to note that most areas where AI is truly useful are enterprise-oriented.\n\nAs a consumer, you may not see how effective these models can be. Keep the term \"enterprise\" in mind, because it means it's not aimed at individual users. That’s why tonight I’m going to start something new: a running list of some of the best AI use cases we've heard about.\"\n\nTo highlight the progress in this area, Cramer is introducing a new feature: a running list of notable AI use cases. He pointed out that some AI applications have been in use for a while. For instance, OpenAI generates revenue from its ChatGPT offerings, with a free version available alongside paid subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus for $20 a month and more expensive options for businesses.\n\n\"Some of these have been around for a while. For example, there's a free version of ChatGPT, but OpenAI generates revenue from $20-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, as well as higher-priced offerings for enterprise customers. The same goes for Gemini and Claude, which have similar pricing. Microsoft's Copilot functionality and Adobe's Firefly tools have also been part of their broader product suite since late last year. Both are money makers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with notable growth potential. It also examines hedge fund perspectives on these stocks, ranking them from least to most owned based on hedge fund ownership.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer recently discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is on the verge of launching a new phone featuring advanced artificial intelligence. Historically, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock has been expensive, but the company has now developed a steady stream of service revenue, providing more stable earnings.\n\n\"How about a company like Apple, which is about to issue a new phone offering the latest in artificial intelligence for consumers? The stock’s historically pricey, but Apple didn’t have a sticky and predictable service revenue stream until now, creating a whole new level of stable earnings. Plus, Apple will be using ChatGPT, which cost OpenAI and Microsoft billions to build, yet Apple gets it for free due to its huge, highly valued installed base.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a compelling investment opportunity despite recent challenges. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Q3 2024 earnings report showed strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $81.8 billion, slightly above expectations but marking a minor year-over-year decline. Notably, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s services segment achieved a record $21.2 billion in revenue, underscoring the success of its shift towards a more services-oriented model.\n\nThe upcoming CFO transition, with Kevan Parekh set to replace Luca Maestri in January 2025, introduces some short-term uncertainty. However, the launch of the iPhone 16 with AI capabilities in September is expected to kickstart a new upgrade cycle and potentially push Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation beyond $4 trillion.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's must-watch stocks today. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "To Buy or Not to Buy Apple Stock Pre Sept. 9 iPhone 16 Event?",
        "content": "Apple AAPL is set to host an event on Sep. 9, in which it is expected to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered iPhone 16 line-up of devices. The company is also expected to reveal details about the Apple Watch 10.\r\n\r\nApple unveiled Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at its annual developers’ event — the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) — on June 10.\r\n\r\nThe new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 plus are expected to be powered by the A18 chip with 8GB for Apple Intelligence support. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max phones are expected to be powered by the A18 Pro chip.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL’s Prospects\n\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nSince WWDC, Apple shares have jumped 18.6%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Micro industry’s rise of 17.5% and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 1.6%.\r\n\r\nHowever, will the AAPL stock’s bullish run continue with the launch of the Apple Intelligence-powered iPhone 16 line-up of devices, or will it fizzle out? \r\n\r\nLet us dig deep to find out what awaits Apple investors.\n\nApple Outperforms Sector Since WWDC Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple’s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, will become more natural, contextually aware and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri’s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to provide device support and answer detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\r\n\r\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT’s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide writing tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nServices Business: Key Catalyst for AAPL Stock\n\nAlthough Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s strong growth driver. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nNew updates include the U.S. national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ to boost user experience.\r\n\r\nApple expects the September-end quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as the June-end quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nApple Shares Overvalued Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nApple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.59X compared with the sector’s 26.47X and higher than the median of 27.64X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWhat Investors Should Do With AAPL Stock?\n\nApple’s AI push is attractive for growth-oriented investors. The Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s sluggish China business has been a headache. Greater China sales decreased 6.5% year over year to $14.73 billion, accounting for 17.2% of total sales in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nA stretched valuation is concerning.\n\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,000 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell leaves after a news conference at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., Dec. 14, 2022. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Billionaire Daniel Loeb Goes Bargain Hunting: 2 Stocks He Just Bought",
        "content": "Investors looking to beat the market could do worse than following the example of Daniel Loeb. The billionaire is the money manager for Third Point, the hedge fund he founded nearly thirty years ago. During that time, he turned $3.4 billion in seed money into a financial powerhouse with nearly $12 billion in assets under management.\n\nLoeb has been called \"one of the most successful hedge fund managers of his generation\" by The Wall Street Journal, generating average annualized returns of 16% over the span of 28 years, beating the returns of the S&P 500 by nearly 6%.\n\nThe billionaire investor has long stressed investing in \"high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations\" but doesn't lose sight of \"their prospective growth.\"\n\nWith that as a backdrop, let's look at two stocks Loeb bought in the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nThird Point's largest new position during the second quarter, by a fair margin, was Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Loeb bought 1.95 million shares of Apple worth roughly $411 million and representing nearly 5% of Third Point's portfolio, making it his seventh largest stake.\n\nLoeb addressed the acquisition at length in Third Point's shareholder letter, noting he purchased Apple shares in April. A quick look at the stock chart reveals that the stock was selling for 26 times earnings, a discount to a multiple of 27 for the S&P 500 at the time. Indeed, Loeb noted Apple's \"relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low,\" thanks in part to \"several years of stagnant growth.\"\n\nThe compelling valuation aside, Loeb cited several factors that made Apple an intriguing pick, including the company's ecosystem of 2.2 billion active devices and market-leading positions in several form factors across numerous key markets.\n\nHe also noted investor fears that Apple would be an \"artificial intelligence (AI) loser,\" but the billionaire came to a different conclusion. Loeb believes the imminent release of Apple Intelligence -- a host of user features steeped in generative AI -- will drive \"meaningful demand within Apple's installed base.\" He went on to posit this \"AI-related demand could drive a step change in improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.\"\n\nI think Loeb's thesis is right on the mark. Apple's revenue is up less than 1% for the first nine months of its 2024 fiscal year after falling 3% in fiscal 2023, thanks to weak iPhone sales. However, inflation fell to 2.9% in July, marking its lowest rate in three years. Improving prices will give consumers more discretionary income. Furthermore, Apple announced the date for its annual iPhone reveal, scheduled for Sept. 9, when the company is expected to provide details for an AI-powered iPhone. This will no doubt spark demand among the Apple faithful, fueling a booming upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThird Point significantly increased its stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, during the second quarter. Loeb bought an additional 850,000 shares of TSMC, increasing his total holdings to 2 million shares worth roughly $352 million and representing 4% of Third Point's portfolio, making it his 10th largest position.\n\nLoeb has been consistently increasing Third Point's stake in TSMC since initiating the position in May of 2023. He noted the company is coming off its \"worst year since the Global Financial Crisis,\" making it a compelling opportunity. Loeb believes the combination of cyclical recovery and strong demand for AI will drive \"substantial earnings growth for the company.\"\n\nTSMC occupies a unique position in the industry, according to Loeb, with a market share of more than 90% for \"leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing,\" which includes the chips used for AI. While AI currently represents a \"relatively small percentage\" of TSMC's sales, he sees TSMC's \"AI revenue growing by multiples in the coming years.\"\n\nI think Loeb has hit the nail on the head. TSMC's dominant market share of high-end processors makes it an odds-on favorite to benefit from these secular tailwinds. Furthermore, after suffering declines of more than 3% last year, the smartphone market has rebounded in 2024, expected to notch growth of nearly 6%, accoring to data supplied by market intelligence firm IDC. As one of the leading providers of smartphone chips, this return to growth will also boost TSMC's results.\n\nIn the second quarter, TSMC's revenue jumped 40% year over year, while earnings per share climbed 36%. Management expects its growth streak to continue, guiding for revenue growth of 34% in the third quarter. It's worth noting that TSMC tends to issue conservative guidance, so the results could well be better.\n\nThe adoption of AI continues to gain steam, and estimates about the ultimate size of the market continue to ratchet higher. While estimates vary, the market for generative AI is expected to be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe economic recovery and adoption of AI will provide multiple tailwinds to drive TSMC higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): This AI Stock Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore’s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\n\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company is expected to debut new AI features that will be integrated into the smart devices that it markets, including the iPhone, at an event next month. Wall Street analysts are excited about the integration of new features since they are expected to drive sales of new Apple devices, primarily because the older models will not be able to support the new features. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring, in an investor note, highlighted that Apple Intelligence remained the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle. The analyst further forecast that the Apple event in September would heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16, though iPhone pricing and iPhone battery life would also be key details to watch.\n\nAt a tech event earlier this year, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed some of the capabilities of the new AI offering, which included massive changes to popular iPhone applications like Siri, Genmoji, and Image Playground. There are rumors that the firm may put advanced features of the AI software behind some kind of a paywall.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Huawei plans to unveil the world’s first commercial-ready smartphone that folds twice, according to a person familiar with its plans. The company is also preparing an Aito electric vehicle launch, though the final products to be released are subject to change, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private plans.\n\nArchrival Apple is launching its new family of iPhone handsets and accessories on Sept. 9, making its pitch for why consumers should upgrade their devices. In China, Huawei pushed Apple out of the top five device makers in the June quarter, after reclaiming its share of the premium market with the Mate 60 series powered by a breakthrough chip. Scheduling an event so soon after the new iPhone’s launch would suggest the company is ready to go head-to-head with Apple again.\n\nYu has been spotted with the new device in hand, dubbed a trifold. Its key advantage would be the ability to fit an even larger, tablet-like screen inside the dimensions of a regular smartphone. Huawei, alongside fellow Chinese device makers like Honor Device Co. and Xiaomi Corp., has developed some of the thinnest foldable phones to date and has been working on evolving the form factor further.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports Need 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA) stands against the other Middle East and Africa stocks.\n\nMENA's Economic Outlook for 2024 and the Rising Interest in Private Equity and Venture Capital Investments\n\nAccording to the Middle East and North Africa Economic Update report published by the IMF in April 2024, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will experience modest growth of 2.7% in 2024, up from 1.9% in 2023. Both oil importers and exporters in the region are expected to grow at similar rates in 2024. The forecasted growth difference between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies and developing oil importers (excluding Egypt) is nearly 1%. GDP per capita is expected to rise by just 1.3% in 2024, driven almost entirely by the GCC economies. The impact of ongoing conflicts has ceased economic activity, particularly in Palestine. In Gaza, economic activity has nearly dropped by 86% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The Palestinian economy's outlook remains highly uncertain, heavily dependent on the conflict's progression. The disruptions in maritime transportation, particularly through the Suez Canal, affected both regional and global trade.\n\nOver the past decade, most MENA economies have seen increases in their debt-to-GDP ratios as MENA oil importers struggle to reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios due to high oil prices. Additionally, oil importers have been unable to lower their debt-to-GDP ratios through inflation, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations and off-budget factors, known as stock-flow adjustments, highlighting the need for greater debt transparency. On the other hand, for MENA oil exporters, periods of high GDP growth are typically associated with smaller increases in nominal debt stocks, leading to a slower rise or even a decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nHowever, interest in private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) has been surging in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting a notable shift in investment preferences within the region. According to recent data, provided by Preqin, in collaboration with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), approximately 65% of investors in the region are either planning to maintain or increase their exposure to private equity this year. Similarly, 56% of investors are keen to do the same with their venture capital investments. This growing interest is partly due to the region's historical under-investment combined with an optimistic outlook on the regional economic and market conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite challenges due to geopolitical tensions, venture capital remains a critical component of the investment ecosystem. The sector is expected to recover as it adapts to the current economic conditions. In the Middle East, investor sentiment towards VC and PE is generally positive. A significant portion of regional investors have reported that their PE and VC investments have met or exceeded expectations. Sectors such as fintech, technology, healthcare, and infrastructure are particularly attractive to investors.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa region is poised for a modest economic recovery in 2024, however, geopolitical tensions and conflicts continue to pose significant challenges. As MENA economies navigate through fluctuating global conditions and regional disruptions, the interest of private equity and venture capital investors reveals the region's promising outlook for investors and economic stakeholders.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners plus online rankings to compile an initial list of the 40 largest companies in the Middle East and Africa by market cap. From that list,  we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of August 23. We also included the market cap of the companies as of August 23. The list is sorted in ascending order of their average upside potential as of August 23.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do?

        "content": "By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Apple's partnership with India's second-biggest telecoms firm will give the iPhone maker a sorely needed boost in a content market where it lags far behind the likes of Spotify and Walt Disney.\n\nThe U.S. technology giant, working to boost revenue globally from services including apps, payments and media, is set to offer free music and video streaming to many of Bharti Airtel's 281 million customers.\n\nThe deal is likely to greatly expand the user base for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in a country where Apple has long emphasised the manufacturing side of business to diversify its supply chain beyond China.\n\nApple builds many of its iPhones in India yet its handsets make up just 6% of the country's 690 million smartphones, versus around 2% in 2019, Counterpoint Research data showed.\n\n\"The move speaks of Apple's ambitions for India,\" said Nitesh Kripalani, former head of Amazon Prime Video in India. \"The strategy is a time-tested method to catapult presence in markets it considers important.\"\n\nIn the U.S., Apple has offered Apple Music for free via some Verizon mobile data plans since 2019, and its Apple TV+ will feature in a Comcast streaming bundle from May.\n\nIn India, Apple Music will become available to premium users of Airtel's Wynk music app, which will eventually close.\n\nPostpaid Airtel contracts give about 7 million subscribers access to the ad-free version of Wynk but only a small fraction use it, said a telecom industry source who declined to be named as the figures are confidential.\n\nNeither Apple nor Airtel responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.\n\nMUSIC BATTLEGROUND\n\nApple Music is more tailored to the Indian market compared with the mostly English Apple TV+ with content including Bollywood and regional-language songs, though its library is smaller than Spotify's, said Counterpoint co-founder Neil Shah.\n\nSpotify has some 3 million paid users in India, Gaana has 1.4 million, Wynk 500,000 and Apple Music 200,000, said an Indian music industry source who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to share estimates publicly.\n\nNeither Spotify nor Gaana responded to requests for comment outside of regular business hours.\n\nOverall, only around 7.5 million people paid for audio streaming services in India last year out of about 185 million users of ad-supported and ad-free apps, showed data from industry group FICCI and consultants EY.\n\nAirtel will pay Apple a per-user fee \"significantly\" lower than the monthly $1.20 charged each for Apple TV+ and Apple Music in India, said the telecom industry source.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn return, it will save millions of rupees in licensing as it looks to shut Wynk and use Apple Music to boost revenue and improve customer loyalty, said a second telecom source\n\n\"Airtel realised its strength is distribution, not content creation,\" said the source on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to discuss the matter.\n\nVIDEO STREAMING\n\nApple is a small player in Indian video streaming, with Counterpoint estimating it has fewer than 1 million users. Disney+ Hotstar is the market leader with 38 million users, while estimates showed Netflix has around 10 million.\n\nHinting at the market's potential, Netflix has repeatedly said it targets 100 million users, without fixing a time frame.\n\nApple TV+ is known for original series such as \"The Morning Show\" and \"Slow Horses\" however rivals including Netflix and Disney feature more Hindi content with Bollywood actors and even regional-language films.\n\nDisney and Reliance Industries' JioCinema also stream cricket - India's most popular sport - and the two companies are merging their Indian media assets to create the nation's biggest entertainment firm.\n\nAirtel, which as telecoms provider lags only Reliance Jio by subscribers, plans to offer packages with several months' free access to Apple TV+, said the second telecoms source.\n\nThough that will get Apple TV+ into more homes, growth could be hindered as its \"offering is still not optimised locally that much,\" said Counterpoint's Shah.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Leading 5G Innovator According to Short Sellers",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n5G and AI Could be Catalysts of Global Digital Transformation\n\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that “AI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.”  This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\n\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\n\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\n\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nShort Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 0.77%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. It is known for its innovative consumer electronics, software, and services, and is best known for its flagship products including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a suite of services such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay. It takes the 3rd spot on our list of best 5G stocks according to short sellers.\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5G journey started with its iPhone 12 in 2020 and it supported more 5G frequencies than any of its competitors in the market. While the company still uses Qualcomm modems, KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the company has plans to launch two iPhone models with its in-house 5G modem in 2025.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the first major step toward the development of its modems when it agreed to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business for $1 billion in 2019. The acquisition brought around 2,200 Intel employees, intellectual property, and equipment to Apple. Ming-Chi Kuo believes that a fourth-generation iPhone SE in the first quarter and a new ultra-thin iPhone 17 in the third quarter could have the company’s own modems.\n\nIn the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at a combined value of $124.175 billion. As of Q2, Berkshire Hathaway owns 400 million shares of the company, worth $84.25 billion, making it the most prominent shareholder.\n\nMar Vista Investment Partners, LLC stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Investors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,00 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings.

(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Sold 389,368,450 Shares of Apple Stock. Was That a Good Idea?",
        "content": "Since 1965, Warren Buffett built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the most successful investment powerhouses of all time. What's curious, however, is that the Oracle of Omaha built his fortune with a startlingly simple investing philosophy.\n\nInvesting like Buffett does not require a fancy degree or even time spent on a trading desk. Rather, adopting the principles of investing in companies with straightforward business models, consistent profits, and positive brand appeal, and holding onto strong conviction positions for many years can help you build generational wealth of your own.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has been a cornerstone of Berkshire's portfolio for years. However, Buffett caught some investors by surprise after recent filings revealed that Berkshire sold 389,368,450 shares of Apple during the second quarter.\n\nTo put this into context, this sale represented nearly half of Berkshire's position in the iPhone maker. Was this a good move, or did Buffett just make an irreversible oversight?\n\nLet's break down the pros and cons of selling Apple stock right now, and assess what may have driven Buffett's decision.\n\nThe case for selling Apple stock\n\nLet's start with the obvious: Berkshire's latest sale of Apple stock isn't anything new. The investment firm trimmed its position in Apple by about 13% earlier this year as well. During a shareholder conference back in May, Buffett strongly suggested that he thought changes to the tax code were on the horizon, which subsequently inspired some of his decision-making to take gains off the table.\n\nIndeed, this reasoning made sense at the time. However, I think there are some other reasons influencing Berkshire's subsequent Apple sales.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway initially started buying Apple stock during the first quarter of 2016. While I do not have the precise dates of Berkshire's investment, Apple stock has a total return of 855% since that January. This is nearly fourfold the S&P 500's total return during the same time period. Although it's nearly impossible to sell a stock at a perfect time, Apple's 19% return so far in 2024 is essentially identical to that of the S&P at the time of this article.\n\nMore importantly, I think investors might not be fully appreciating where Buffett is creating value for his shareholders outside of stocks right now. For the quarter ended June 30, Berkshire held $276.9 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Berkshire's short-term investments include a massive $237.6 billion position in U.S. Treasury Bills (T-bills). One of the hallmarks of Buffett's investing style is that he likes consistency, and rolling over T-bills is an incredibly reliable strategy.\n\nStory continues BRK.A Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe case for not selling Apple stock Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe most obvious reason I can think of for not selling Apple stock right now pertains to the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. Earlier this year, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI -- the developer of the popular tool ChatGPT. The impetus of this alliance is for Apple to bring a new wave of generative AI capabilities to its devices through the power of OpenAI.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently made the case that bringing AI to Apple's ecosystem will spur a new wave of demand for next-generation iPhones. Should Ives be proved correct, Apple's business could be on the verge of supercharging.\n\n\"I think this starts a historical period,\" says Wedbush's @DivesTech.\r\n\r\nHe breaks down what investors and potential buyers can expect from $AAPL's upcoming iPhone 16 event. pic.twitter.com/FzHNufUUB6\n\n-- Squawk on the Street (@SquawkStreet) August 27, 2024\n\nWhy it doesn't matter for Buffett\n\nWhile I understand the theory put forth by Ives, my personal take is that Buffett is not fully enamored by the AI hype. Moreover, even though Berkshire sold roughly half its stake in Apple, the iPhone maker still represents about 30% of the total portfolio. For these reasons, I don't think Buffett is too worried about any missed profits because Berkshire stands to benefit from AI tailwinds anyway.\n\nFurthermore, considering Buffett could have made a commensurate return investing in the S&P this year as opposed to having industry-specific exposures holding Apple, I can see why he took some money off the table and has opted for a more reliable investment in T-bills. Moreover, given the uncertainty around the upcoming presidential election (and therefore potential changes to the tax code) as well as any volatility this could inspire in the markets, I don't see Buffett's decision to offload a chunk of Apple stock to be poorly timed or misdirected.

        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had a slow start to the year, with its shares down 12% at the beginning of May. Dwindling product sales, poor market conditions, and an uncertain position in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market caused investors to pull back.\n\nHowever, the tech giant has turned things around since then, with its stock soaring 34% since May 1. Apple won back Wall Street by beating expectations in its third quarter of 2024 and with announcements hinting at an exciting future in AI. In Q3 2024 (ended June 29), the company's revenue increased 5% year over year, beating analysts' forecasts by $1.4 billion. The quarter profited from a 24% spike in iPad sales and a 14% increase in services revenue.\n\nRegarding AI, Apple is gearing up to make a massive push into the industry with the release of its iPhone 16 in September and the launch of Apple Intelligence -- a generative overhaul of its operating systems.\n\nApple's stock has risen more than 177,000% since it went public in 1980, benefiting from the success of market-shifting products like the first iPhone. The company's meteoric rise over the years might have some analysts questioning whether its stock can have much more to offer. However, Apple is entering a new chapter of its history with AI and could enjoy major gains as its technology develops.\n\nSo, here's why Apple could help you retire a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nApple could be gearing up for a lucrative shift in its product lineup\n\nIn late August, Apple revealed the date for its highly anticipated iPhone keynote. The event will take place on Sept. 9, announced with the tag line \"It's Glowtime\" -- likely a reference to its AI theme.\n\nThe company has ramped up its expansion into AI this year, announcing Apple Intelligence in June and now getting ready to release its iPhone 16. The new smartphone will be Apple's first designed with AI in mind, and the company has invested billions to get there. The tech giant's research and development (R&D) hit $8 billion in 2024, up 10% from last year. AAPL R&D to Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis chart shows Apple spent nearly 10% of its total sales last year on R&D expenses, hitting a peak not seen for 20 years. In fact, the last time its R&D was this high, Apple was gearing up to launch the first iPhone and was revolutionizing the music business with the iPod. And its stock has since climbed 60,000%.\n\nWhile it could be concerning for investors to see the company spend so much on AI, it also raises the question: What does Apple have up its sleeve? The tech giant isn't always the first to move toward an industry. It has a reputation for taking a gradual approach to a new market, then showing up and stealing the show by quickly rising to dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nProducts like smartphones, tablets, headphones, and smartwatches were all led by different companies before Apple landed on the scene. Meanwhile, market share in each of these industries quickly went to Apple once products like the iPhone, iPad, AirPods, and Apple Watch launched.\n\nApple's free cash flow reached $104 billion in 2024, indicating it has the funds to keep investing in AI and catch up to its rivals. As a result, now could be an excellent time to invest before its stock soars over the next decade.\n\nMultiple ways to monetize its AI efforts\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are mainly focused on the business side of AI, investing heavily in their respective cloud platforms. However, Apple has a unique opportunity to dominate the consumer sector. The popularity of its various products and the potential to add paid-for AI services to its library of digital subscription-based platforms could help it carve out a lucrative role in the industry. Apple Inc (AAPL) - Services Revenue Chart\n\nOver the last five years, services revenue growth has massively outperformed all of Apple's other segments (as seen in the chart above). Services are on a trajectory to surpass the iPhone in total revenue to become the company's highest-earning business; an AI revamp of its products could encourage millions of product upgrades. Meanwhile, new generative services could help Apple earn money from those products for years.\n\nApple's earnings are estimated to hit just over $8 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying that figure by its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34 yields a share price of $285, projecting stock growth of 25% over the next two fiscal years. Consequently, holding its shares over a decade or two could help a sizable investment cross that million-dollar mark by retirement.\n\nApple has significant potential and is a compelling buy for long-term-minded investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: ‘Buy Nvidia pullback,’ Apple named Top AI Pick",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nBuy Nvidia stock pullback - UBS, BofA\n\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant’s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\n\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn’t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\n\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should “buy the pullback,” noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia’s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as “the most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.”\n\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\n\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\n\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is “likely to be volatile” in the near term due to Nvidia’s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\n\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia’s long-term prospects, stressing that they “continue to believe in NVDA’s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.”\n\n“AI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.”\n\nCiti moves Apple to Top Pick\n\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their “top AI pick” for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the “It’s Glowtime” product event on September 9th.\n\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Apple’s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,” Citi analysts remarked.\n\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\n\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\n\nThe analysts also highlighted that “AAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.”\n\nAI bubble burst bigger concern than recession - BCA Research\n\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm’s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\n\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,” BCA noted.\n\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\n\nWilliam Blair starts Tesla coverage with a Buy rating\n\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\n\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\n“We view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\n\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\n\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\n\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\n\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\n\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company’s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\n\nCiti opens Positive Catalyst Watch on Marvell stock\n\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\n\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline—two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\n\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,” analysts wrote.\n\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,” they added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: ‘Buy Nvidia pullback,’ Apple named Top AI Pick\n\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\n\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n\nView comments",

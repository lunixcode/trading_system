        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 biggest billionaire winners in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Biggest Billionaire Winners in 2024.\n\nGlobal Wealth: An Analysis\n\nThe rich people continue to become richer while poor people continue to suffer from hardships without having access to clean water, adequate healthcare, decent housing, or education for their kids. According to the 2024 World Inequality Report by Oxfam, the world’s billionaires have increased their wealth by over $3 trillion in the last three years. The top five richest people in the world more than doubled their fortunes from $405 billion to $869 billion since 2020, growing at a rate of $14 million per hour. In comparison, almost five billion people have become poorer since 2020. The five richest men in the world have become twice as wealthy and are worth more than $1 trillion, as of September 30. The report suggests that to end poverty it could take up to 230 years, while the world could have its first trillionaire within a decade.\n\nIn the US, over 60% of workers live paycheck to paycheck despite major improvements in employee productivity and technology. The real weekly wages for the average US worker are lower today than they were 50 years ago. The increase in inflation and the uncertain economic situation have impacted the lives of daily-wage workers. However, global wealth has rebounded from its 2022 drop and wealth is improving around the world with a few exceptions. According to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report 2024, the number of people living in the lowest wealth bracket has shrunk since 2008, while the rest of the wealth brackets have experienced growth. The lowest wealth band adults, below $10,000, nearly halved between 2000 and 2023. The majority of the adults have moved up to the second band, between $10,000 and $100,000. The report adds that people are now three times as likely to be millionaires and have wealth over $1 million. There are quite a few examples such as Larry Ellison, Sergey Brin, and Thomas Peterffy, the richest people in the world who came from poor families. The richest people in the world who came from poor families are the most influential entrepreneurs today and many of them live like regular people.\n\nApproximately $83.5 trillion of wealth will be shifted to the next generation within the next 20 to 25 years, as per Credit Suisse’s Wealth report. Out of $83.5 trillion, nearly $9 trillion of the wealth will be shifted horizontally between spouses, the majority in the Americas. Almost 10% of women billionaires and millionaires are expected to be part of the global wealth shift to the next generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe millionaire population is also increasing and by 2028, they are expected to rise from 52 countries to 56. Taiwan is expected to have the highest millionaire growth by 2028, growing by almost 50%. Reaching millionaire status opens the path to becoming a billionaire. Let's talk about one such firm where most employees became millionaires due to share purchases at an early stage.\n\nREAD ALSO: 20 States with the Lowest Gas Taxes in the US and 12 Countries With Best Moody’s Credit Rating For Sovereign Bonds.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the highlight of the US stock market for more than a year now.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 7 Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nThe Fed recently cut the funds rate by 50 basis points which has been considered a bold move by some analysts while others and most of the market have welcomed it with open arms. Moreover, over 50% of interest rate traders expect another 50 bps cut in the next meeting as well, according to the CME Fed-watch tool.\n\nWhile the Fed’s move might seem risky, the broader market is up over 2.5% since the cuts, as of September 27.\n\nJeremy Siegel on the Fed’s Bold Move\n\nIn an interview with CNBC Squawk Box on September 19, Professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School expressed his strong approval of the Fed’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. He called it the best news from the Fed in years.\n\nProfessor Siegel believes that this move will lead to a significant rise in the stock market and pointed out that the Fed is now addressing the gap between current rates and what he considers the “new neutral” Fed funds rate of 2.9%.\n\nHe said that the Fed has shifted from expecting only one rate cut by the year’s end to anticipating four cuts in total, with the market reflecting expectations of a gradual approach to future cuts.\n\nWhen asked about concerns from former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson, who warned that the market might be overreacting to the cuts, Siegel said that smaller, consistent rate decreases would be enough.\n\nHe suggested that if inflation remains low, the Fed could implement 25 basis point cuts in the upcoming meetings, ultimately reducing rates to around 3.3% to 3.5%. He said with confidence that inflation would not rise significantly, as he referenced the market indicators suggesting it could fall below 2% next year.\n\nIn a discussion about economic policies from the presidential candidates, Professor Siegel critiqued both sides as extreme and said that their policies are unlikely to be implemented. He said that there would be a divided government that would limit any drastic changes. He stressed that while some policies might be proposed, actual governance would lead to compromises rather than sweeping reforms.\n\nHistorical Insights on Rate Cuts and Stock Returns\n\nAccording to data from Ned Davis Research, historical trends indicate that stocks tend to perform favorably in the year following the initial interest rate cut. According to the data, the broader market has recorded an average increase of around 12% in the first six months and 15% in the first twelve.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the generally positive outlook for stocks following interest rate cuts, there were exceptions in 2001 and 2007, when the broader market saw declines of 12.4% and 22.2%, respectively, in the year following the Fed’s actions. This shows that historical average performance does not guarantee that rate cuts will always yield favorable outcomes.\n\nHowever, looking at the last ten rate cut cycles since 1974, the market has risen in eight of those instances, with four cycles resulting in gains of over 20%. Additionally, after the 1974 cut cycle, the market reached a remarkable 40% increase.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to compile a list of over 30 stocks with 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 30% or above. Next, we narrowed our list to 7 stocks most favored by analysts. The 7 best revenue growth stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of September 27.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nIs NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Best Revenue Growth Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Price Target Upside: 23.56%\n\n5-Year Revenue CAGR: 56.73%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in graphics, computing, and networking solutions. Established in 1993, the company initially carved out a niche with its pioneering graphics processing units (GPUs), which excel at handling multiple tasks simultaneously.\n\nThe innovation has made it a critical player not only in the gaming industry but also in sectors such as professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. The company operates through two main segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking.\n\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs and the GeForce NOW game streaming service, while the Compute & Networking segment features data center platforms and advanced AI software.\n\nIts stock has received a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 27, the average price target of $150.00 has an upside of 23.56% from current levels. It ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nIn 2023, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) captured an impressive 94% market share in AI server sales as per Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh’s estimates, which reinforces its dominance in the rapidly growing AI GPU market.\n\nThe company’s data center revenue has surged at a rate significantly outpacing that of competitors, which show a strong demand for its products. Customers are actively seeking NVIDIA’s Hopper AI GPUs, which are expected to be succeeded by the next-generation Blackwell chips. The demand for these upcoming processors is projected to surpass supply through 2025, which is a sign of a strong pipeline for future revenue.\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best revenue growth stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Major Stocks to Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best major stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nThe Post-Fed Rate Cut Opportunities\n\nThe current economic landscape presents a mix of signals as market participants assess the necessity of additional interest rate cuts. Despite overall economic strength, the Fed has hinted at potential rate reductions due to weaknesses in specific sectors. Currency dynamics are also shifting, with the US dollar weakening against the euro, adding another layer of complexity to the market environment. Amidst this backdrop, major stock indices, including the Dow Jones, continue to hover near record highs.\n\nAs analysts and market participants navigate these developments, they must consider how these factors may influence investment strategies in the coming months. Recently, discussions have emerged regarding the implications of potential rate cuts and their effects on various sectors of the economy. Some experts argue that further cuts may be necessary to support smaller businesses and consumers who are still adjusting to previous interest rate hikes.\n\nStephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hightower thinks that a soft landing for the economy despite market volatility is anticipated, which is a contrasting perspective amidst market volatility and uncertainty. While there are concerns regarding the performance of small-cap stocks and their ability to keep pace with larger assets, she thinks the economy may stabilize without entering a recession. We talked about this in more detail in our article on the 10 Best Young Stocks To Buy Now, here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“….She believes that the Fed is skillfully guiding the economy towards a soft landing, even amidst the expected market fluctuations before the elections.\n\nJust 3 weeks ago, the S&P 500 had dropped by 4%. Still, it rebounded by 4% the following week. It rose another 1% last week, reaching new highs, and expressed optimism about buying opportunities during any market weakness, citing better-than-expected economic growth driven by recent data, including improved retail sales and manufacturing figures, as well as a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 4-month low. This positive economic backdrop supports an estimated growth rate of 2.9%, which is expected to benefit corporate earnings.\n\n….Link noted a broadening market trend over the past couple of months, indicating that while tech has taken the lead, other sectors such as financials, industrials, materials, and discretionary stocks are also showing strength.”\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Stoltzfus from Oppenheimer Asset Management joined CBNC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ on September 25 to discuss the difference the Fed’s recent rate cut makes. It was highlighted that the S&P 500 is experiencing a remarkable moment, having just achieved its 41st record close of the year. Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist has set a target of 5,900 for the index, attributing this optimistic outlook to the recent rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nStoltzfus explained that the significance of these cuts lies in their actual implementation after a long period of rate hikes and pauses. He described the rate cut as a down payment from the Fed to both Wall Street and Main Street, signaling that further cuts could be on the horizon if necessary. Since this announcement, the market has shown mixed reactions, with defensive stocks performing well at times while technology stocks have also seen gains.\n\nWhen discussing consumer discretionary stocks, Stoltzfus expressed that this sector is one of their favorites despite its underperformance earlier in the year. He noted that there has been a noticeable improvement in performance over recent months as investors recognize consumer resilience. However, he emphasized that within consumer discretionary, investors should focus on select companies rather than expecting a broad rally across the sector. Retailers leveraging e-commerce effectively are likely to perform better during the upcoming holiday season.\n\nThe conversation also touched on concerns regarding discounts in various sectors, particularly electronics. Stoltzfus acknowledged that value has become a key focus for consumers, which has led to increased competition among retailers. This competition allows consumers more options but may also pressure profit margins for some retailers. Nonetheless, he pointed out that many businesses within consumer discretionary, beyond just retail, are likely to maintain healthy margins.\n\nStoltzfus’ discussion highlighted the positive impact of the Fed’s rate cuts on market sentiment and consumer behavior while recognizing challenges in specific sectors. The outlook remains optimistic as investors navigate through these transitions and prepare for potential opportunities in consumer discretionary stocks and other sectors.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to look for mega cap stocks.

        "content": "As the U.S. escalates export controls on China, TikTok’s owner is reportedly planning to use a homegrown chipmaker for an artificial intelligence model it’s developing.\n\nByteDance is planning to build an AI model using chips from Huawei, Reuters reported, citing three unnamed people familiar with the matter. The company wants to use Huawei’s Ascend 910B chips to train the model, the people said. ByteDance has reportedly ordered over 100,000 of Huawei’s chips, but, as of July, has received less than 30,000 of them. One person told Reuters the model under development is expected to be less powerful than ByteDance’s Doubao model, which was released last August.\n\n“The entire premise here is wrong,” a spokesperson for ByteDance said in a statement shared with Quartz. “No new AI model is being developed.”\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company’s Ascend 910B chip is used for less intense AI model inferencing, people told Reuters, but training requires more compute power, and therefore, more advanced chips. And Huawei was reportedly having a hard time increasing production of the Ascend 910B — China’s best alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA) chips that cannot be sold to Chinese customers under U.S. trade restrictions. The chip fabrication machines Huawei uses to produce the advanced chips are designed for older generations of chips, The Information reported, and repurposing them was causing certain components to break down.\n\nSince the U.S. began implementing trade restrictions on advanced chips, including those designed by Nvidia, in 2022, ByteDance has sought chips from Chinese companies, and worked ondeveloping its own. ByteDance has designed two chips with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) that it plans to mass produce by 2026, The Information reported.\n\nThe Chinese government, meanwhile, is encouraging tech companies to buy AI chips from local companies, and become less dependent on Nvidia, Bloomberg reported. Nvidia has developed three AI chips for the Chinese market in compliance with export controls, including the H20, which ByteDance has ordered hundreds of thousands of.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is set to undergo a stock split after the market closes on Monday, aligning itself with other prominent AI-driven companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which also executed stock splits earlier this year. Following the split, the stock will begin trading Tuesday at its adjusted—and substantially lower—price.\n\nShortly after the market opened on Monday morning, Super Micro Computer’s shares were priced at $426, reflecting a 1.5% increase.\n\nWhat is SMCI’s stock split?\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 stock split is expected to boost demand for the company’s shares. In a stock split, the company increases the number of shares, reducing the share price, but the total dollar value of all shares outstanding remains the same and doesn’t affect the company’s valuation.\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s 10-for-1 split means that, for each SMCI share an investor owns, they will receive an extra nine after the split is completed.\n\nA rollercoaster year for SMCI\n\nThe San Jose-based IT company, which makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship.\n\nSuper Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including potential sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms.\n\nFollowing these accusations, Super Micro’s stock price took a significant hit. The company refuted the claims, stating that the report contained misleading and inaccurate information and that it would address the allegations in due course.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mizuho’s Asia hardware and semiconductor analysts have raised their 2025 forecast for Nvidia’s AI GPU units, anticipating stronger-than-expected growth driven by expanded production capacity.\n\nThe analysts adjusted Nvidia’s total 2025 AI GPU shipments by 8-10% higher than its July 2024 estimates, citing key supply chain improvements, especially in CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate) technology.\n\nThe report highlights that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to ship between 6.5 to 7 million units in 2025, including 3 million units of CoWoS-S GPUs. These will largely include the Hopper and Blackwell models, with CoWoS-S reaching a yield of over 99%.\n\nIn addition, CoWoS-L, another Nvidia process, is expected to produce between 3.8 and 4 million units, with a focus on supporting the high-demand GB200 server racks, allocating 80-90% of the output to this product line.\n\nMizuho’s revised forecast comes as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia’s key production partner, is doubling its annual wafer capacity.\n\n“We expect the tightness in CoWoS supply to continue into 2025 but project gradual improvement with an estimated annual wafer capacity of above 650,000 coming on line at TSMC next year (up 2x YoY),” the note states.\n\n“In addition to increasing front-end (chip-on-wafer) capacity, some back-end (on-substrate) processes are expected to be outsourced to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE), and the supply-demand situation is expected to gradually improve.”\n\nAnalysts think that investors' concerns about potential delays in the Blackwell GPU rollout have been “exaggerated,” pointing out that both TSMC and SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) are on track for sales growth following the launch of the Blackwell GPU in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nOverall, Mizuho’s Asia hardware and semis analysts do not expect delays on the semiconductor side, including AI GPUs and ASICs, to impact AI server production in 2025. They also noted that Taiwanese back-end equipment vendors, such as Allring Tech, are likely to benefit from TSMC's vendor localization efforts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNVIDIA 2025 GPU unit forecast raised at Mizuho\n\nLebanese arrive in Turkey shaken by war, hope for quick return\n\nWall St mixed ahead of data-loaded week; Powell's comments awaited\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'This Is A Big Deal,' Says Jensen Huang As Nvidia CEO Tries On And Raves About Meta's New 'Orion' AR Glasses\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang got a first look at Meta’s new AR glasses and was impressed. At the recent Meta Connect event, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, presented a reaction video that included Huang trying on the Orion prototype glasses. “The head tracking is good, the brightness is good, the color contrast is good, the field of view is excellent,” he said, calling the lightweight design “a big deal.”\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nIn the video, prominent figures in tech, media and even Olympians expressed excitement over the Orion glasses, describing them as “it’s crazy responsive,” “learning with these will be amazing,” and “it’s so fast.” Overall, the feedback seemed overwhelmingly positive.\n\nSome of the reactions after $META unveils it's first AR holographic headset \"Orion\". $NVDA Jensen Huang included in their reaction video. pic.twitter.com/aAn8rvkzNM\n\n— Financial Berg (@FinancialBerg) September 25, 2024\n\nThese glasses are Meta's first attempt at a full holographic augmented reality device and Zuckerberg called them the “most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.”\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nZuckerberg revealed that despite major technical obstacles, the team has worked on these glasses for 10 years. The goal was to create glasses with a wide field of view, that are lightweight and that allow users to see through them clearly – all while integrating cutting-edge technology. The result is a pair of glasses powered by a battery in the arm that bends light to generate realistic holograms of various sizes and depths using tiny projectors.\n\nEven though Orion isn't available to the public yet and there's still work to be done, Meta is letting some external developers get their hands on the prototype. The company is also focusing on refining the design and lowering prices before launching a consumer version.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nGiven that Nvidia is among the leading businesses in the IT industry, Jensen Huang’s praise is noteworthy. Its GPUs are essential for AI and AR applications and Meta has been a massive client, stockpiling Nvidia’s technology to power its ambitious AI projects. By the end of 2024, Meta expects to have nearly 600,000 GPUs in its arsenal, so Huang's positive feedback carries extra weight.\n\nHuang recently talked about a future where smart digital assistants would be with us throughout our lives, learning and growing alongside us. He's excited about having a computer that gets smarter over time, helping with daily tasks like having your own personal R2-D2 or C-3PO.\n\n“I love the idea that I'll have my own R2-D2, my own C3PO and my R2 will be following me,” he stated, adding, “People who are just growing up now they're going to have their own personal R2 with them.”\n\nRead Next\n\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500.

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) fell as much as 2.8% in premarket trading Monday as investors continued to absorb news that Chinese regulators are reportedly discouraging local companies from buying Nvidia’s artificial intelligence chips.\n\nThe stock pared losses after the bell, down about 1.4% to around $120.\n\nBloomberg reported Friday afternoon that Beijing is urging Chinese companies to buy from chipmakers within its own borders — rather than Nvidia’s popular GPUs — amid heightened trade tensions with the US. Nvidia shares ended the day down 2.2% to $121 and fell further early Monday. Meanwhile, Chinese AI chipmaker Cambricon Technologies (688256.SS) surged 20% in Monday trading.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe US enacted tougher export controls on AI chips to China in late 2022 — and has continued to tighten those rules in an attempt to hinder China’s ability to surge ahead in the so-called AI arms race. Nvidia has felt the impact: Sales to China made up 14% of data center revenue during the company’s fiscal year ended Jan. 28, 2024, compared to 19% the prior year.\n\nNvidia has responded by attempting to work around those roadblocks by creating specific versions of its chips for China, which comply with the stricter controls.\n\nIts “H20” Hopper chips for China launched this year — and are forecast to generate $12 billion in revenue for the company this year. Nvidia is also set to launch a version of its latest Blackwell chip, called “B20,” for China. A release date has not been set. In the meantime, the black market for Nvidia chips has taken off. Ups and downs: Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, keynote speaker at SIGGRAPH 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nNvidia sales in China have recovered in recent quarters. Revenue from sales in China totaled about $3.7 billion in the most recent quarter ended July 28, up 33.8% from the prior year, according to Bloomberg estimates. Nvidia shares are up 144% since the start of the year.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Nvidia despite historic volatility in the semiconductor sector. About 90% of Wall Street analysts recommend buying the stock and see shares rising to $147.61 over the next year, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nDaniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance that there is “strong optimism right now from the top leaders” in the semiconductor sector. He noted that Nvidia stock has been more volatile since its 10-for-1 stock split in June.

        "title": "How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation",
        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmong the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOf all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nEven though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.\n\nMicrosoft's diverse revenue streams and strong competitive moats\n\nMicrosoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.\n\nNote that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.\n\nWindows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nWith these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.\n\nMicrosoft's pathways to future growth\n\nIn the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: Microsoft's presentation\n\nFor the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.\n\nConstructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.\n\nMore personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.\n\nThe cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.\n\nSome more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.\n\nWhat bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.\n\nMicrosoft's high valuation is justifiable\n\nConsidering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nAs the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.\n\nThis valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.\n\nTraditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).\n\nIn short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Brad Gerstner Thinks Nvidia (NVDA) is the ‘Most Important Company’ — Here’s Why",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.\n\n“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\n“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.\n\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): Leading the AI Revolution Despite Blackwell Delays\n\nBrad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nBrad Gerstner’s Stake: $956,299,667\n\nBrad Gerstner is extremely bullish on Nvidia. In September, while talking to CNBC, the investor said that Nvidia is the “most important” company and indicated that he was not worried about the reports of Blackwell delays.\n\n“Nvidia is not just in the business of generative AI. What Jensen has reminded us that we are going to have to replace the trillion dollars of CPU-driven data centers,” the investor said.\n\nHe also addressed the question of ROI on AI spending.\n\n“So I think this  red herring about ROI here is one that Wall Street spends a lot of time thinking about but when you look in the board rooms of all the hyper scalers of the big enterprises they are all leaning into investing.”\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nHungry upstarts don’t always get the attention of major players, but in the case of You.com, founder Richard Socher got a front-row seat with Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\n\n“I was extremely impressed with Jensen,” Socher told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (above video; listen in here).\n\nHis AI-powered search engine recently announced a $50 million Series B round with investors including Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM) Ventures, and DuckDuckGo. The capital raise valued the Google (GOOG) and Yahoo rival at close to $1 billion.\n\nSocher said he met with Huang for nearly two hours around the time of the investment, discussing topics ranging from history to running a business.\n\n“I don’t generally get nervous with most people, but it was very impressive to hear him giving advice,\" Socher said.\n\nDuring his conversation, Socher says Huang shared that “he focused a lot on the speed of Nvidia\" during its early years.\n\nEventually, Nvidia opted to pivot a little to gain focus.\n\n“At some point, they realized that the best way is to focus on gaming first and really dominate that niche,” Socher said, adding that Huang suggested staying focused on You.com's mission of being an AI-powered alternative to Google.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Socher and Nvidia have crossed paths.\n\nIn the early 2010s, his research group at Stanford utilized Nvidia GPUs. At that time, Nvidia mostly sold GPU products to the graphics sector. “Nvidia was like, ‘who are you? Why are you trying to buy our GPUs,’” said Socher, noting that GPUs now assist with the company's AI workloads.\n\nNvidia launched in 1993 — born from Huang's scribbling on a napkin at a Denny's — to develop 3D graphics for gaming and multimedia purposes. Back then, an increasing number of consumers were taking the computing plunge, leading to demand for higher-powered computers.\n\nSix years later, Nvidia introduced graphics processing units (GPU), and in 2012, it brought AI to the forefront by introducing the AlexNet neural network.\n\nThis summer, Nvidia introduced an initiative that would bring generative AI to a wider audience using its latest GPU technology. The company's AI chips are seen as having a wide performance lead over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), leading to impressive financial results over the past two years.\n\nNvidia's second quarter sales and earnings rose 122% and 152%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAfter a summer pullback following mixed third quarter guidance, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world. It sports a market cap of $2.98 trillion, while Microsoft sits at $3.18 trillion and Apple stands at $3.46 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance's comparison tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date, shares are up 145% compared to an 18% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

American depositary receipts of Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO jumped 13% in premarket trading Monday after NIO China secured a $2 billion investment from its parent company and state-backed investors. The company said in the news release that “deterioration in the global industry backdrop reflects a lower 2024 market forecast than at the beginning of the period, while competitive dynamics have intensified due to both rising industry supply, as well as increased Chinese competition.”\n\nContinue reading\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia shares fall and its Chinese rivals soar after Beijing urges AI companies to look elsewhere for chips",
        "content": "Nvidia’s share price has taken a knock, and its Chinese chipmaking rivals have soared, after Beijing reportedly discouraged Chinese AI companies from buying Nvidia’s chips.\n\nBloomberg reported on Friday that Chinese regulators had issued guidance steering AI firms away from Nvidia’s H20 chips—these aren’t Nvidia’s most cutting-edge AI chips, but they’re the most powerful that the company can sell to China under U.S. export restrictions that aim to hold back China in the AI race.\n\nThe new immediately hit Nvidia’s share price by 2.2%. In pre-market trading on Monday, the AI chip leader was down by another 2%. Nvidia suppliers and contractors such as Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron and TSMC were also down.\n\nThe falls were weighing on the markets more widely this morning, as Nvidia—whose stock has more than doubled so far this year—has an outsized role these days.\n\nBut the story was very different for the Chinese chip companies that were intended to be the beneficiaries of Beijing’s guidance.\n\nShares in Cambricon and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), which are both partially owned by the Chinese state, soared by 20% on Monday, hitting the daily limit on the Shanghai exchange. Naura Technology Group, which produces chipmaking equipment, saw its stock pop by 9.8% in Shenzhen.\n\nYears of Western export controls have had some success in slowing the advance of China’s AI efforts, denying Chinese companies the latest and greatest chips and, by holding back the most advanced production equipment, making it harder for Chinese chip companies to keep pace.\n\nProgress at Huawei, for example, was set back two years by the redesigns that were needed to produce its AI chips locally, and the performance of its recent Ascend 910B chips may be limited by production problems at contract manufacturer SMIC.\n\nOn Monday, Reuters reported multiple sources saying that TikTok parent ByteDance was planning to use the 910B chips to train an upcoming model. ByteDance reportedly already uses these chips for inference—essentially, running AI models—but using it for the more computationally demanding task of training would be another matter.\n\nByteDance denied that it was working on a new model. Nonetheless, if Reuters’ report is accurate, it again points to the limits of what China’s chip producers can currently achieve; one source told the newswire that Huawei was delivering the 910B chips too slowly for ByteDance’s needs.\n\nHowever, the export controls have also pushed China’s chip sector to adapt and work faster. The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a major tech industry lobbying group, warned earlier this month that “U.S. efforts to slow China down are unlikely to work in the long run.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Micron Shares Surge on Outlook, Defying Analyst Expectations. Is the Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Shares of Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) soared after the company reported strong results and offered upbeat guidance. Ironically, more than half a dozen Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets in the weeks ahead of its earnings report, with many scrambling now to increase their targets following its results.\n\nWith the stock up over 25% on the year, let's look to see whether it is too late to buy Micron stock or if this could be just the beginning of its rally.\n\nHigh-bandwidth memory a big opportunity\n\nLike many other chipmakers, Micron is also seeing a boost from soaring demand for the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout, as the company saw record data center revenue in its fiscal 2024.\n\nOne area of emerging growth is in its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which help reduce power consumption and improve performance in AI chipsets. Its newest HBM3E chip is used in Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) H200 processors and will be used with its new Blackwell chipsets as well.\n\nThe company said it saw \"several hundred million dollars\" in HBM revenue this past fiscal year and expects \"multiple billions of dollars of revenue of HBM in fiscal year '25.\" It said the total addressable market (TAM) for HBM has gone from $4 billion in 2023 to more than $25 billion in 2025. It noted that its HBM production is sold out for both calendar 2024 and 2025.\n\nOverall, for its fiscal third quarter, Micron saw its revenue surge 93% to $7.8 billion. Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) revenue rose 93% to $5.3 billion, NAND revenue increased by 96% to $2.4 billion, and other revenue was $59 million, up 18%.\n\nBy segment, Compute and Networking revenue soared 152% to $3 billion, while Storage revenue jumped 127% to $1.7 billion. Mobile revenue climbed 55% to $1.9 billion, while Embedded revenue rose 36% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in a $1.18 compared to a loss of $1.07 a year ago. That was well ahead of the adjusted EPS of $1.11 that analysts were expecting.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron guided for fiscal Q1 revenue to be between $8.5 billion and $8.9 billion, with gross margins between 38.5% and 40.5%. It is looking for adjusted EPS of between $1.66 and $1.82. Analysts were looking for adjusted EPS of $1.52 on revenue of $8.27 billion.\n\nAfter spending $8.1 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in fiscal 2024, the company said it expects that amount to be significantly higher in fiscal 2025. Unlike many chipmakers today, Micron does much of its own chip manufacturing and is building new fabs (chip manufacturing facilities) in New York and Idaho. Its increased capex will also go toward investments in HBM chips.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it too late to buy Micron stock?\n\nMicron is enjoying strong growth from the AI infrastructure buildout and sees huge potential in its HBM chips. However, it is worth noting that it is not the only HBM supplier. South Korea's SK Hynix is the main supplier of these chips to Nvidia. Samsung also makes HBM chips but has run into some technological issues with them.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while Micron is manufacturing its own chips, SK Hynix uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, to produce its chips. Given that Nvidia likely needs as many HBM chips as possible and that Micron isn't taking up capacity at TSMC's fabs, it should remain a strong second-source supplier to Nvidia in this area.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Micron's stock appears pretty cheap, trading at a forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple of just over 12 based on analyst estimates of $9.05 for the current fiscal year. It wouldn't be surprising to see those estimates increased in the coming days and weeks after its strong fiscal Q1 guidance.\n\nHowever, a company like Micron will trade at a much lower multiple than chip companies like Nvidia or Arm Holdings as both DRAM and NAND memory tend to be very cyclical in nature. There is still some worry that DRAM inventory is too high in areas such as smartphones and PCs and that, eventually, this will cause prices to come down. Thus, how Micron performs over the next year could very much depend on how large of a hardware refresh cycle there is due to AI and whether it can soak up this supply to stabilize prices.\n\nWhile the HBM opportunity is real and likely to continue growing, the worries about DRAM oversupply and pricing are also real. As such, I'd continue to hold the stock, but I wouldn't be rushing out to buy it after this jump. I would continue to monitor comments on DRAM pricing and supply.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp., NVDA, American Express Co., AXP, Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ELTP and PrimeEnergy Resources Corp PNRG.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for NVIDIA, American Express and Wells Fargo\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., American Express Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., as well as two micro-cap stocks Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+150.6% vs. +106.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+80.9% vs. +21.8%). The company’s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.\r\n\r\nAmerican Express’ solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\r\n\r\nHowever, with higher utilization of AXP’s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)\r\n\r\nWells Fargo’s shares have underperformed the Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-1.4% vs. +6.2%). The company’s loan growth is likely to remain limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding operational risk management.\r\n\r\nThe bank agreed to divest its non-agency third-party servicing segment of the Commercial Mortgage Servicing (CMS) business to Trimont. High mortgage rates and low originations is likely to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, its progress on efficiency initiatives, like branch and footprint reduction, will support cost reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to aid its financials, driven by the strength in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment. With a strong capital position and decent liquid profile, the capital distribution seems sustainable.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the year-to-date period (+177.9% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $415.56 million has seen first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues surged 109.4%, driven by the success of its Elite label products.\r\n\r\nThe company’s expanding portfolio includes high-value Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for medications like Methotrexate and controlled substances, positioning it for continued growth. Its recent facility expansion enhances manufacturing capacity, supporting future product launches.\r\n\r\nA robust pipeline and favorable generics market dynamics support long-term prospects. Elite Pharmaceuticals boasts positive cash flows, low debt and a solid cash position.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include customer concentration, pricing pressure from large buyers, intense competition, and regulatory challenges related to controlled substances. Supply chain vulnerabilities and potential overextension in product launches are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy Resources’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the year-to-date period (+30.3% vs. -4.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $242.79 million has a strong production growth, evidenced by a 134% increase in oil and a 95% rise in natural gas production in the second quarter of 2024, positions it well for continued revenue and earnings expansion.\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy Resources’ financial health is supported by nearly doubling revenues and tripling net income in the first half of 2024, along with an expanded $115 million credit facility that enhances liquidity for ongoing drilling. Favorable oil prices and strategic acreage in the Permian Basin offer long-term growth potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include exposure to volatile oil and gas prices, rising production costs, heavy capital expenditures and dependency on a limited number of partners. The shift toward renewable energy and potential regulatory changes pose long-term risks to its traditional oil and gas operations.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy Resources here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Wall Street's Most Anticipated Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Split of the 4th Quarter Has Arrived",
        "content": "For much of the last 30 years, investors have had a next-big-thing technology or trend to captivate their attention. The rise of the internet, business-to-business commerce, and cloud computing are just some of the big-dollar addressable markets that have lured investors.\n\nBut on rare occasion, two hot trends vie for Wall Street's attention at the same time. In 2024, we've witnessed the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and stock-split euphoria converge to lift the stock market's major indexes to record-closing highs. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies have available to cosmetically adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. What makes these share price adjustments \"cosmetic\" is that they have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance.\n\nThough there are two varieties of stock splits -- forward and reverse -- investors focus most of their attention on companies completing forward stock splits. Whereas reverse splits, which increase a company's share price, are often conducted from a position of operating weakness, the businesses enacting forward splits are pretty consistently outpacing their competition with regard to innovation and operational execution.\n\nSince the start of 2024, a little north of a dozen noteworthy companies has announced and/or completed a stock split. All but one of these high-profile splits is of the forward variety, which aims to make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors.\n\nWith AI stocks surging in 2024, it's no surprise that some of the most-prominent stock splits are leading AI companies. But after the close of trading today, Sept. 30, the most-anticipated AI stock split of the fourth quarter will take center stage.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom were Wall Street's preeminent AI stock splits of 2024\n\nOver the last four months, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) have hogged the headlines among artificial intelligence stocks -- and for good reason.\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia became the first AI stock to announce its intent to split its shares. Following a greater than $2 trillion increase in Nvidia's market cap in less than 17 months, the company's board declared a 10-for-1 forward split, which went into effect following the close of trading on June 7.\n\nNvidia's historic increase in value relates to its early stage dominance of the AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) market. The company's variety of GPUs, including the ultra-popular H100, hold a virtual monopoly in enterprise AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about the upcoming release of the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, which is considerably more energy efficient than its predecessor chip and can accelerate everything from generative Ai solutions to quantum computing calculations. Nvidia hasn't been shy about investing in innovation and should have no trouble retaining its AI-GPU computing advantages for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, AI networking solutions provider Broadcom announced its first-ever stock split in mid-June. This 10-for-1 forward split went into effect after the close of trading on July 12.\n\nJust as businesses are counting on Nvidia's hardware to be the brains of high-compute data centers, Broadcom's networking solutions are leaned on to minimize response times for requests -- something critical for AI-driven software and systems -- and maximize the computing capacity of AI GPUs.\n\nWhile Broadcom's rapid growth stems from its AI solutions, it's a company with a considerably more diverse revenue stream than leading AI stock Nvidia. For instance, it's one of the largest providers of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. A consistent device-replacement cycle fueled by the 5G revolution has been music to Broadcom's ears.\n\nWhile Nvidia was the cream of the crop among AI stock-split stocks during the second quarter, and Broadcom's split hogged the spotlight in the third quarter, there's a new AI stock split ready for its moment in the sun. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWall Street's most-awaited AI stock split of the fourth quarter is here\n\nWhen after-hours trading officially ends on Sept. 30, customizable rack server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) will complete its first-ever split since going public more than 17 years ago. Similar to Nvidia and Broadcom, Super Micro's split is 10-for-1, which will reduce its nominal share price to around $40 per share.\n\nShares of Super Micro have skyrocketed 779% over the trailing-two-year period, with demand for AI infrastructure leading the charge. Sales for the company more than doubled to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), with the midpoint of the company's current guidance for fiscal 2025 at $28 billion. CEO Charles Liang foresees annual sales eventually reaching $50 billion.\n\nSomething else working in Super Micro's favor is the incorporation of Nvidia's prized H100 GPUs into its AI-focused rack servers. Relying on this top hardware has made it something of a go-to for businesses wanting to gain an edge over their competition and/or secure a first-mover advantage.\n\nBut there are, ultimately, two sides to this coin. While Nvidia's H100 is exceptionally popular and the preferred hardware choice in AI-accelerated data centers, it's also backlogged due to overwhelming demand. Super Micro Computer's reliance on Nvidia's AI-GPUs comes with the risk of not being able to meet the demand of its own clients.\n\nAnother risk for Super Micro Computer is the potential for the AI bubble to burst. There hasn't been a next-big-thing technology or trend for at least 30 years that's avoided a bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors always overestimate how quickly a new technology or trend will be adopted and gain utility. With most businesses lacking a clear game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investment, at least in the early going, all signs point to artificial intelligence being the next in a long line of highly touted bubbles.\n\nIf the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests it will, it wouldn't be the first time that hype surrounding Super Micro failed to live up to expectations. Growth forecasts for the company were through the roof in the mid-2010s. Unfortunately, the rise of cloud computing failed to meet these lofty expectations, which sent the company's stock spiraling lower.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that noted short-seller Hindenburg Research has alleged that Super Micro Computer engaged in \"accounting manipulation.\" The Wall Street Journal also reports that the U.S. Justice Department has launched an early stage probe into the company. Although Super Micro has denied these claims, the company did delay the filing of its annual report. Despite Liang stating that he has confidence in his company's internal teams and doesn't anticipate any material changes to the company's reported financials, this filing delay clearly has investors skittish.\n\nWith Super Micro Computer's much-anticipated stock split finally here, we'll soon find out which side of the aisle the retail investing community prefers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Sold 72% of Coatue's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap Dual-Industry Leader",
        "content": "On Wall Street, important data releases are a common occurrence. Monthly inflation and jobs reports, coupled with Wall Street's leading businesses reporting their quarterly operating results over a six-week stretch every quarter, can make it easy for a key data release to slip under the radar.\n\nAug. 14 marked what can arguably be described as the most important data dump of the third quarter. This was the last day to for institutional investors and wealthy asset managers to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details which stocks Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (i.e., the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt was a particularly busy quarter of additions and subtractions for billionaire Philippe Laffont at Coatue Management. Laffont's hedge fund, which is primarily focused on higher-growth tech stocks, oversees more than $25 billion in assets spread across 74 holdings.\n\nWhat's most noteworthy about Laffont's trading activity has been his continued selling of former top holdingNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), as well as his purchasing of shares of a company that's a leader in two industries.\n\nLaffont's fund has shed nearly three-quarters of its Nvidia stake in 15 months\n\nWhen March 2023 came to a close, Coatue Management held a split-adjusted 49,802,020 shares of Nvidia stock. I say \"split-adjusted,\" because the king of artificial intelligence (AI) completed a historic 10-for-1 forward stock split in June 2024.\n\nBut when the curtain closed on the second quarter, Laffont's fund was holding \"just\" 13,754,447 shares of Nvidia. This equates to a 72% decline over 15 months and dropped Nvidia from Coatue's top holding by market value to No. 4.\n\nProfit-taking may explain some of Laffont's persistent selling. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's shares have increased by nearly 750%, with the company tacking on around $2.7 trillion in market value. We've never witnessed the valuation of a market-leading businesses expand so quickly, which may be encouraging Laffont and his team to ring the register.\n\nBut there may be more to this selling than meets the eye.\n\nFor example, every game-changing innovation, technology, and trend since the advent of the internet has endured an early innings bubble. These bubbles consistently occur because investors overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will be adopted by consumers and/or businesses. Invariably, every one of these new technologies, innovations, and trends needs time to mature, which is seemingly never baked into investor expectations. More than likely, AI is the next in a long line of overhyped innovations that will need time to mature.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's management team and board aren't giving billionaires or everyday investors reasons to be excited. Not one Nvidia insider has purchased shares of their company on the open market since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress in December 2020. Almost four years without insider buying sends a crystal-clear message to Wall Street that shares aren't attractive.\n\nLaffont and his advisors may also be anticipating competitive pressures picking up for Nvidia in the coming quarters. A number of chipmakers have debuted or are in the process of developing AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) that will compete directly with Nvidia's popular H100 and coming Blackwell GPU architecture.\n\nFurthermore, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing GPU platforms of their own. Even if these customers choose to simply complement the Nvidia hardware they've purchased, this looks to be a clear signal that future order opportunities will be limited.\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont has been dumping shares of Nvidia, he's been piling into a historically cheap company that sits at the top of the pecking order in two industries. Image source: Amazon.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont can't get enough of this historically inexpensive dual-industry leader\n\nAlthough Laffont and his team added to 21 existing positions and opened stakes in six others during the June-ended quarter, the purchase that really stands out is the 702,235 shares added to Coatue's existing position in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The roughly 10.77 million shares of Amazon held by Coatue equates to more than 7% of invested assets (as of June 30), and is the fund's second-largest holding by market value, behind only Meta Platforms.\n\nMost investors are familiar with Amazon because it's the undisputed e-commerce leader. In 2023, it accounted for nearly 38% of domestic online retail market share, which is more than 31 percentage points ahead of Walmart, which occupied the No. 2 spot.\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce presence is the face of the company and helps to draw more than 3 billion visits each month, online retail sales generate menial margins and minimal operating cash flow. The bulk of what makes Amazon special can be traced to its three ancillary operating segments, none of which is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAccording to data from tech analysis firm Canalys, AWS accounted for a 33% share of global spend for cloud infrastructure service platforms in the June-ended quarter. This is well ahead of the 20% market share for Microsoft's Azure, which is the No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider.\n\nEnterprise cloud-service spending is still in its relatively early stages of expansion. To boot, the AI revolution is sparking plenty of interest in generative AI solutions and large language models, which are being incorporated into AWS for clients. AWS consistently accounts for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income on a quarterly basis and is responsible for a sizable percentage of the company's rapid growth in cash flow.\n\nThe other two ancillary segments of importance include advertising services and subscription services. With over 3 billion visitors each month and an expanding content library, Amazon is having no trouble commanding strong ad-pricing power.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon recently landed an 11-year streaming rights deal with the NBA and WNBA, and is the exclusive streaming partner of the NFL's Thursday Night Football. Securing popular sports packages will only increase the value of Prime subscriptions.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle that looks to have Laffont favoring Amazon over Nvidia is its historically cheap valuation. Throughout the 2010s, investors paid a median of 30 times cash flow to own shares of Amazon. As of this writing on Sept. 26, shares are valued at less than 13 times cash flow for 2025.\n\nWith a valuation that's more compelling than, arguably, any point in its publicly traded existence, Amazon has the tools and intangibles needed to outpace Nvidia in the return department.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Decade Opportunity: 2 AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 175% and 560%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Historically, certain technologies have played a pivotal role in driving the stock market higher. That includes the internet in the 1990s, mobile devices in the 2000s, and cloud computing in the 2010s. Artificial intelligence is shaping up to the next decade-defining technology, and these Wall Street analysts are extremely bullish on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\nPhil Panaro of Boston Consulting Group believes Nvidia will be an $800 stock by 2030. That forecast implies about 560% upside from its current share price of $121. Hilary Kramer of Greentech Research believes Palantir could be a $100 stock within a few years. That forecast implies about 175% upside from its current share price of $36.40.\n\nInvestors should never lean too heavily on forecasts. A recent study found that only half of price targets correctly predict which direction a stock will move, meaning far fewer predict the actual price with any degree of accuracy. However, Nvidia and Palantir warrant further consideration.\n\nNvidia: 560% implied upside\n\nNvidia dominates the market for data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that perform technical calculations faster and more efficiently than central processing units (CPUs). In practice, GPUs are used to accelerate complex workloads such as training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nNvidia GPUs are the industry standard. Not only because they consistently outperform rival products, but also because Nvidia has a more robust ecosystem of supporting software that simplifies application development. That ecosystem, called CUDA, makes Nvidia GPUs the go-to option for developers. As proof, the company holds between 70% and 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\n\nPhil Panaro at Boston Consulting Group believes Nvidia's next-generation GPU, called Blackwell, will further reinforce the company's dominance in AI as the new chips start to percolate the market in the fourth quarter. Panaro noted that Nvidia stock traded sideways during the months prior to releasing its previous generation of GPUs, called Hopper.\n\n\"Once they released it, the stock went up hundreds of percent. So, I see the same thing happening with Blackwell,\" he said in a recent interview with Schwab Network. Additionally, Panaro also said he expects Nvidia to generate $600 billion in revenue in fiscal 2031 (ends January 2031). That implies growth of 33% annually, which roughly matches Grand View Research's prediction that AI spending will compound at 36% annually through 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia undoubtedly has a strong position in a rapidly growing market, and it has reinforced its dominance by branching into adjacent verticals like networking equipment and cloud infrastructure services designed for AI workloads. Even so, I see a valuation problem with Panaro's forecast.\n\nMaybe Nvidia will generate $600 billion in revenue in fiscal 2031. But a share price of $800 implies a market capitalization close to $20 trillion. So, Panaro's revenue estimate implies a price-to-sales ratio of 33. Nvidia currently trades at 31 times sales, and that's actually a premium to the three-year average of 26 times sales. I doubt Nvidia will command a higher valuation six years from now.\n\nHaving said that, I think Nvidia stock can outperform the S&P 500 through the end of the decade, perhaps substantially. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in the stock today.\n\nPalantir Technologies: 175% implied upside\n\nPalantir sells analytics software to commercial organizations and government agencies. Its products include the data management platforms Foundry and Gotham, and the artificial intelligence platform AIP. Those tools help customers integrate data, develop and manage machine learning models, and incorporate those assets into analytical applications that improve decision-making.\n\nIn August, Forrest Research recognized Palantir as a leader among vendors of machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms. The report analyzed companies based on the strength of their current offering and growth strategy. Palantir outscored every other vendor in terms of its current offering, but Alphabet and C3.ai received higher scores for product development strategy.\n\n\"Palantir is a true, true artificial intelligence company that really looks at data, analyzes it, and uses it for actual decision-making,\" Greentech Research analyst Hilary Kramer told Fox Business. She brushed aside Goldman Sachs' price target of $16 per share, which implies 55% downside from the current share price of $36.40, saying major investment banks have yet to appreciate the full potential of Palantir's software.\n\nI think those investment banks would wholeheartedly disagree on the basis of valuation. Like Nvidia, Palantir has a strong presence in a quickly growing market. The International Data Corp. (IDC) estimates AI platform spending will increase at 51% annually through 2030. But Palantir trades at 217 times earnings, and the Wall Street consensus calls for annual earnings growth of 24% over the next three years.\n\nThose figures give an outrageous PEG ratio of 9. For context, PEG ratios of 1 or 2 are usually considered to be reasonable. Given the current valuation, Wall Street is quite bearish on Palantir. The median price target of $27 per share implies 26% downside from its current share price. Personally, I would steer clear of this stock until the valuation comes down. That does not necessarily mean Palantir shares will crash any time soon. I am simply pointing out that the stock is very expensive, which means the risk-reward profile is heavily skewed toward risk.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\n\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Exclusive-ByteDance plans new AI model trained with Huawei chips, sources say",
        "content": "(Reuters) - TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance plans to develop an AI model trained primarily with chips from compatriot Huawei Technologies, said three people familiar with the matter, as U.S. curbs turn the social media giant homeward in search of chips.\n\nByteDance has diversified to domestic suppliers of chips used in artificial intelligence and accelerated development of its own since the U.S. in 2022 started restricting exports of advanced AI chips such as from market leader Nvidia.\n\nAI has become central to the technology industry with firms in sectors as varied as gaming and e-commerce differentiating offerings through the integration of custom AI models - programs that employ pattern recognition to make decisions.\n\nByteDance's next step in the AI race is to use Huawei's Ascend 910B chip to train a large-language AI model, said the people, declining to be identified as the plan is confidential.\n\nA fourth person also said ByteDance is planning a new AI model but could not say whether it will use Huawei chips.\n\nByteDance already uses the Ascend 910B primarily for less computationally intensive inference tasks, which involve pre-trained AI models making predictions, the three people and a separate source said.\n\nTraining AI models is far more demanding and requires huge amounts of data, necessitating the use of ultra-high-performance chips such as Nvidia's premium graphics processing units.\n\nThe new model's capability and complexity, measured by its computing parameters, will be less powerful than ByteDance's existing AI model Doubao, one of the people said.\n\nByteDance did not reply to a request for comment. Michael Hughes, a TikTok spokesman in Washington D.C., said, speaking on behalf of ByteDance, \"The entire premise here is wrong. No new model is being developed\".\n\nHuawei did not reply to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nTIGHT SUPPLY\n\nByteDance has ordered more than 100,000 Ascend 910B chips this year but has received fewer than 30,000 as of July, a pace too slow to meet company needs, one of the people said.\n\nThe constrained supply and limited computing power versus Nvidia's China-available chips have prevented ByteDance from setting a timeline for the new model, two of the people said.\n\nByteDance's current AI technology is used in its flagship large-language model launched in August 2023 and rebranded as chatbot Doubao, and in many other applications including a text-to-video tool Jimeng. It introduced two video-focused Doubao models this month to compete with OpenAI.\n\nUse of such applications has ballooned since early this year, with ByteDance's chatbot becoming one of China's most popular apps with more than 10 million monthly active users.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe increased emphasis on AI has made ByteDance one of the largest buyers of Huawei's AI chips, the three people said.\n\nIt is also the biggest buyer of Nvidia's H20 AI chip, which the U.S. chipmaker tailored for the China market in response to trade restrictions, said two of the people. The TikTok owner is also Microsoft's biggest client in Asia for Nvidia chips accessible via cloud computing, said two separate sources.\n\nReuters previously reported that ByteDance allocated $2 billion for Nvidia chips last year.\n\nNvidia declined to comment. Microsoft did not reply to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters staff; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Christopher Cushing)",

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares recently rose after a new report from Bain & Company said the AI-related hardware and software market is expected to grow between 40% and 55% annually, reaching between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027.\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Trending AI Stock to Watch for the Rest of 2024?\n\nPhoto by Microsoft 365 on Unsplash\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 279\n\nSome believe OpenAI was the only key edge Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) had in the AI race and it’s quickly fading away.\n\nDA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum.\n\nLuria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA.\n\nLuria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins.\n\nThe analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities.\n\nThe concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of AI adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 31% in constant currency of which 7% was AI related versus 3% two quarters ago. Further, management noted most of the AI revenue continues to stem from inference rather than training indicating high quality AI applications by Microsoft’s clients. Management also indicated that the significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America are done, suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure’s growth are over. Separately, management provided color on their new AI-productivity tool, Copilot, noting that approximately 60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using Copilot, and that the quarter witnessed a 50% increase in Copilot assistance integration within Teams. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in AI, given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.”\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.

        "title": "Here's the Best-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stock of 2024 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Power utilities aren't always seen as the most exciting way to invest, but investors might need to rethink that opinion, because the top-performing S&P 500 index stock of the year is retail electricity and power generation utility Vistra(NYSE: VST), up a whopping 210% this year. That beats Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) 155% increase. The two events are not unconnected. Here's why and how Vistra stock has performed so well this year.\n\nData centers, electricity demand, and clean energy\n\nIt's no secret that the burgeoning demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications is the reason for the step change in expectations for data center demand. That's what's fueling increased demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and high-performance computing chips. That's great news for technology companies like Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nWhile the latter are apparent beneficiaries, there are also data center equipment companies like Vertiv Holdings. If you are looking for a value play on the theme, then the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration sector, particularly Johnson Controls, is worth looking at.\n\nHowever, I digress. This article's focal point is the need to power data centers and increased electricity demand. In particular, it is in an environment where policymakers remain committed to the clean energy transition. That's where companies and utilities like Vistra and Constellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) come into play.\n\nVistra\n\nVistra is a retail electricity and power generation company. At the end of 2023, it counted 4 million retail customers, and the acquisition of Energy Harbor in March added another 1 million. The Harbor Energy deal also added 4,000 megawatts (MW) of nuclear generation to go along with the 36,702 MW with which Vistra ended 2023, with 2,400 MW from nuclear. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAs such, the deal made Vistra \"the largest competitive power generator in the country\" and made it the second-largest competitive nuclear generator in the U.S. Investors are falling in love with nuclear energy as a clean, sustainable, and zero-carbon baseload option. That's particularly relevant as coal-powered plants are being closed down in accordance with the clean energy transition.\n\nThe clean energy transition\n\nWhile nobody doubts that the transition will take place, it's also indisputable that sentiment over the pace of the transition has changed, too. The long-term policy outlook remains favorable to renewable energy; natural gas will likely be a significant part of energy generation for decades.\n\nThat's also good news for Vistra, because about 24,000 MW of its current 41,000 MW capacity comes from natural gas. As such, the rise in the stock price this year also reflects a more favorable view of natural gas and a vote of confidence in Vistra's 6,400 MW nuclear capability.\n\nEnter Amazon and Microsoft\n\nThe three biggest cloud service providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, and they need to ensure long-term power to support their data centers. As such, Microsoft and Amazon completed long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) with Vistra this year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStill, it's the 20-year PPA that Microsoft recently signed with Constellation Energy that has excited the market. Microsoft is purchasing power for its data centers, and Constellation will restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to deliver on the agreement. That's a positive for the market, and so is the price that Microsoft is willing to pay for the power.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Microsoft is paying up to $115 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in the agreement. That compares favorably with Vistra's total realized price of $51.20 MWh in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nA stock to buy\n\nThe bull case for Vistra rests on the idea that there's significant upside potential for future market pricing for nuclear-powered energy, given the Microsoft/Constellation deal and burgeoning demand stimulated by AI. Vistra's acquisition of Energy Harbor strengthened that case. In addition, Vistra recently announced it was buying the remaining 15% of its Vistra Vision subsidiary (which houses its zero-carbon nuclear, energy storage, and solar generation businesses) for $3.085 billion.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nRegarding dividend investing, the total percentage yield is the proverbial great white whale that dividend investors are hunting. However, the biggest whales usually swim in the deepest water, which poses a higher risk for whalers. The same applies to two Yieldmax ETFs, which pay 84% and 77% dividends while betting on magnificent seven stocks. Keep reading to find out if these offerings are right for you.\n\nTesla and Nvidia are two of the hottest Magnificent Seven stocks in terms of delivering share growth for investors, but they don't offer the strongest dividends. Yieldmax has devised a unique way to (theoretically) give investors the best of both worlds via high-earning ETFs. Instead of buying shares in Tesla and Nvidia, these ETFs maximize investor return by trading options on Tesla and Nvidia stock.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rate cuts could supercharge the real estate industry. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nThe YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:NVDY) pays an incredible 84%, while the YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:TSLY) is churning out an eye-popping 77% dividend. Numbers like this are certainly impressive but considering that most investors turn cartwheels over 10% dividends, it's understandable if you're wondering if there's a catch.\n\nThe potential catch is these ETFs’ approach to generate those high dividend yields. Unlike most traditional ETFs which own diverse stock portfolios, these ETFs aggressively purchase options on Nvidia and Tesla. The fund uses a combination of investor capital and treasury securities to serve as collateral and then generates option spreads on the respective stocks.\n\nThe ETF's option trading method falls into one of two categories. Yieldmax refers to the first method as a \"standard strategy\" where the ETF sells call options and put options on the underlying stock to create investor profits. The other method, which they call an \"opportunistic strategy,\" works by selling \"at-the-money-call options\" and buying \"at-the-money-call options\" to give investors chances to profit if the stock price goes up.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nIn either case, the main focus for these ETFs is generating income for investors, not share price appreciation. Options trading is known for being able to generate large sums for investors in short periods. Unfortunately, you can lose just as big if you wind up on the wrong side of a deal.\n\nThere is another caveat aside from the inherent risk associated with options trading. If these ETF share prices depreciate over time, which many analysts believe is likely, the high yield percentage may not deliver more profit than simply owning shares of the underlying stock. Each ETF's payout is also inextricably tied to the performance of only one stock, as opposed to being highly diversified like many other ETFs.\n\nAll that elevates the risk profile of these ETFs. So, despite the high-performance potential these ETFs offer, a savvy investment advisor might caution you not to put large chunks of your portfolio into these ETFs. It may also be advisable to redeem your dividend payments instead of reinvesting them into more shares. With that in mind, 84% and 77% dividends are intriguing enough to make these ETFs worth a second look.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "content": "Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang Once Said 'Zero-Billion-Dollar Markets' Are His Favorite. Here's What That Means And How It Could Help You\n\nMost individuals consider established markets – places with plenty of customers and money to be made – when they think about launching a new product or beginning a business. However, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang takes a different approach. He’s more interested in “zero-billion-dollar markets.” By adopting this unconventional strategy, Nvidia has become one of the most valuable businesses globally. What does he mean by this, and how can it be useful to you?\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nUnlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million with just $500. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nA zero-billion-dollar market is one that doesn’t exist yet. Put another way, there are neither competitors nor customers because no one has considered it or dared to invest in it. This approach is risky because the results aren’t guaranteed, but they may be very lucrative if they succeed. Jensen Huang’s mission is to find and turn these unexplored niches into thriving industries.\n\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nSo, why does Jensen love these markets? The reason is simple: no competition. When you're the first to enter a brand-new market, you set the rules, define the product and have a chance to become the leader. Huang's experience with Nvidia shows this perfectly.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he bet big on \"accelerated computing\" with CUDA technology. This wasn't an established market – nobody was buying GPUs for AI computing because AI computing as we know it today didn't exist. But Huang believed in it and invested in it, and now Nvidia dominates the AI chip market.\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nEntering a market that doesn't exist might sound like setting up a lemonade stand in the desert, but it's more strategic than that. Here's why:\n\nIf there are no customers, there are no competitors either. You don't have to fight over market share with established giants. Being first means defining the standards and creating a strong brand identity. The market may be worth zero dollars today, but it could be worth billions tomorrow if you're right about its potential.\n\nTrending: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nYou don't have to be a tech giant to use this approach. Whether you're an entrepreneur, a small-business owner, or just someone with a big idea, here's how you can apply Huang's philosophy:\n\nStory continues\n\nThink about areas in your life or industry with unmet needs or unsolved problems. These are potential zero-billion-dollar markets. Don't be afraid of small beginnings. When Netflix started, DVDs by mail seemed like a crazy idea. They were solving a problem no one knew they had. Now, they're a global powerhouse. Small, seemingly niche ideas can grow into major industries. Building something new takes time and patience. Nvidia didn't become a leader overnight – it took years of investment and belief in a market that no one else thought was viable. So, be prepared for the long game. Embrace failure and learn from It. Not every zero-billion-dollar idea will work, and that's okay.\n\nAs Huang puts it, “I'd rather be a market maker, market creator than a market taker. [It] is a good way to cause the company to think about how to go create something for the first time.”\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "title": "Is Arm (ARM) the Best UK Growth Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best UK Growth Stocks To Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other UK growth stocks.\n\nThe Economy of the United Kingdom\n\nAccording to a report by KPMG, the United Kingdom’s GDP growth will slow in the second half of 2024 but will pick up slightly to 1.2% in 2025. This growth is expected to be driven by a less restrictive monetary policy and continued improvements to real wages, which could support stronger consumption and business investment. However, the longer-term GDP growth could be limited to around 1.1% a year due to a historically weak pace of productivity growth.\n\nUK inflation is expected to rise to 3% in early 2025 after falling below 2% in September. This increase is attributed to the ongoing economic recovery and the impact of interest rate cuts on the economy. However, the Bank of England is expected to approach easing monetary policy cautiously, with the base rate expected to reach 3.5% by the end of 2025, to stimulate the economy while avoiding overheating and inflationary pressures.\n\nThe UK’s consumer spending is expected to be dampened by higher savings rates. UK consumers have been putting a significantly higher proportion of their income aside since the pandemic, which may continue to reduce spending growth. While some of the increase in savings could unwind as interest rates fall, a significant part of the increase in savings could prove more persistent, owing to longer-term demographic trends and increased caution in response to a more volatile economic environment. In terms of investment, the forecast expects overall investment growth to accelerate as further interest rate cuts reduce the drag on business investment, and the new Government's focus on accelerating economic growth could also help spur a positive momentum. The UK labour market is expected to continue to loosen despite robust activity in the UK economy over recent quarters. The forecast notes that firms could see easier hiring and weaker wage growth ahead as the labour market continues to adjust to changing economic conditions.\n\nThe United Kingdom’s Market Outlook\n\nNeil Shah, Director of Research at Edison Group, a leading investment research company in the United Kingdom, said that the market is concerned about the economy's growth slowing down, but interest rates are decreasing at the same time. As a result, investors are taking a barbell approach by balancing their portfolios with a mix of growth stocks and defensive positioning.\n\nShah highlights the UK's relative attractiveness from a valuation perspective, particularly compared to its European peers. He notes that there have been reports of investors investing elsewhere but believes that the UK market is starting to come into focus, with positive signs such as the consumer holding up better than expected.\n\nShah also discusses the ongoing outflows from UK pension funds, which have reduced their allocations to the UK from 50% to 3%. He believes that this selling pressure is starting to bottom out and that there are signs that it may start to turn around. Additionally, Shah highlights the capital markets reform agenda, which he believes has a lot of ambition, but needs to be implemented.\n\nShah said that there are many undervalued stocks in the UK and that investors are starting to take notice. He mentions that there has been a rotation out of Europe and into the UK, driven by economic concerns in some European countries and geopolitical issues. This trend will continue, and the UK market will eventually become more attractive to investors.\n\nThe economy of the United Kingdom is expected to experience a moderate growth rate driven by a less restrictive monetary policy and improvements to real wages. The forecast by KPMG suggests that the UK economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace and will be stable in the coming years. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 7 best UK growth stocks to invest in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 7 best UK growth stocks to invest in, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 20 largest companies in the UK in growth-related industries. We then narrowed our choices to 7 stocks according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of the second quarter.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nA robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment.\n\nArm (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nArm (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor company based in the UK that has been revolutionizing the industry with its innovative intellectual property for processors. Arm’s (NASDAQ:ARM) business model is supported by strong license and royalty revenue growth, driven by the increasing adoption of its chip architecture, which offers significant cost and energy efficiency advantages. The company's partnerships with leading technology giants such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia further solidify its position in the market.\n\nThe company's royalty revenues have been consistently increasing, driven by the increasing adoption of its Armv9 architecture, which offers 35% greater performance efficiency compared to its predecessor, Armv8. Additionally, Arm's chip shipments have averaged 4% growth for the past three years, with revenue per shipment increasing moderately by 7%. The company's license revenue has also seen significant growth, with an average increase of 30% over the past four years, driven by the rising number of licensees, which has grown by 25% annually.\n\nArm (NASDAQ:ARM) has dominant position in mobile applications, with a 99% market share, and its growing presence in high-growth end markets such as cloud and network equipment, position it for continued success.  In the second quarter, the company’s stock was held by 38 hedge funds with stakes worth $979.08 million. D E Shaw is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $340.67 million as of June 30.\n\nOverall ARM ranks 1st on our list of the best UK growth stock to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI feel like I have gotten dumber each day of September.\n\nAnd honestly, I have no one to blame but the person looking back in the mirror.\n\nI have mostly spent the month on the West Coast ingesting the latest advances in artificial intelligence. First at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference, then Salesforce's (CRM) annual Dreamforce extravaganza, and currently with AI chats on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (now stationed at the Nasdaq). I'll toss in a Netflix event I went to Thursday night where Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates talked for an hour, mostly on AI and the future of the world.\n\nTechnically, I guess all of these AI discussions are making me a more informed journalist, leader, and human being.\n\nBut sometimes listening to what people deep in the weeds are doing in AI sound like a completely different language. Think Martians speaking on Pluto. And the lingo and development of AI tools and products are moving at a speed multiples faster compared to my last West Coast venture in September 2023.\n\nHard to keep up and not think you have an IQ of 75!\n\nIt already feels like I am way behind the curve on understanding the next wave of AI — and that's alarming because 1) there's potential for at least five more waves to hit civilization; 2) the average person on the street unlikely realizes how their very way of life is about to be affected by an AI-powered agent or some other piece of technology. Bill Gates dives into the future of the world at a Netflix event on Thursday alongside journalist Kara Swisher. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWe saw that firsthand with the new AI functionality Meta (META) and OpenAI showed off this week for their various products. This was a series of wow moments.\n\nBill Gates proceeded to tell a packed theater that AI will soon become \"superior\" at \"very profound\" tasks. Reassuring!\n\nI also experienced it up close and personal with a real nice German fella named Richard Socher on Opening Bid (video above).\n\nNever heard of the 41-year-old Socher? You should be following his work at search engine You.com, a company he founded. He was the first chief scientist at Salesforce (CEO Marc Benioff was an early backer of You.gov), and he eats, sleeps, and breathes AI.\n\nThe company is now valued at close to $1 billion after an investment led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHere are a couple of quotes from Socher that left an impression:\n\n\"I think over the next few years and maybe decades, almost every company will be hit with some kind of innovator's dilemma in that the way they used to make revenue is going to change because a lot of their processes are going to get automated with AI. And that just changes the nature of the work that you're doing. You need to stop thinking about almost any repetitive process. Every time you feel like, oh, I've done this before, I'm just going through these steps, you should be giving those as a prompt to an agent and then get an accurate AI agent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think actually in the next few years, we're probably going to see more and more AI agents surfing the web for you than we have people surfing the web, which will change the web as we know it too, and how it often monetizes. But it basically means that a lot of people will get access to their own personal assistant in the way only really wealthy people have right now.\"\n\nYou may be wondering what this all means to you, the investor.\n\nHere are a few notes from me on that front before you go:\n\n2025 is going to be one hell of a year for Nvidia and AMD (AMD). The demand for AI chips only seems to be strengthening. What that means for struggling Intel (INTC), well... This coming earnings season, listen for executives at companies you invest in outline cost-cutting moves by using AI. If you hear crickets, it could be a signal the company doesn't have a great AI strategy in place and risks getting left behind. Today is the day to buy three books on AI to understand the lingo and possibilities — and then think critically on how the technology could be applied to investments you are eying.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "As even the most casual observers know by now, artificial intelligence has been a boon to stocks. Numerous companies in this field have seen their shares register huge gains -- often by triple-digit percentages.\n\nThe problem with this growth is that it can leave investors wondering whether it is too late to buy. AI could drive the cutting edge of technology for years to come, but each stock still has to be evaluated individually. These two Motley Fool contributors have ideas about Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), two key stocks to watch.\n\nAI alone can't justify this price tag\n\nJustin Pope (Microsoft): Microsoft continues to reward shareholders with market-beating returns, seemingly to no end. The stock is up 37% during the past year, nudging past the S&P 500's 34% gain.\n\nThere's a reason for the run-up: Artificial intelligence (AI) could trigger years of growth in the technology sector, and investors will be hard-pressed to find a company that is more plugged into AI than Microsoft. The company's Azure cloud platform was already the world's second-leading cloud provider and is now riding AI tailwinds higher.\n\nThat said, investors should start to sweat the stock's valuation a bit. AI is new and exciting and could help Microsoft cultivate growth, but this is a $3.2 trillion company. A business can become so big that it gets harder to grow and justify a higher valuation. Is Microsoft approaching this point?\n\nAnalysts estimate that Microsoft's earnings will rise by an average of 13% annually for the next three to five years. Frankly, it's remarkable for a company of its size to increase earnings at a double-digit percentage rate.\n\nThat said, it's getting harder to justify the increasingly higher valuation. After a year of gains, Microsoft trades at almost 33 times 2024 earnings estimates.\n\nThat gives it a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of almost 2.4. I generally buy stocks with PEG ratios of about 2.0 or less. Even if you argue that Microsoft deserves a premium for its high-quality business, you're starting to pay a high price for its expected growth. There is a risk of a steep price retreat if something happens and growth falls short.\n\nMicrosoft isn't so expensive that you should rush to dump the shares, but it's hard to make the case to continue buying after the strong year the stock has had.\n\nTread carefully with this market leader\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): Nvidia surged 193% during the past year due to its crucial role in the AI boom. Since investors discovered that its AI chips powered the ChatGPT AI platform, both demand for its AI chips and its stock price have spiked.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of this gain can be traced to its dominance in AI chips. Although AMD, Qualcomm, and Intel have scrambled to bring AI chips to market, they have not matched Nvidia's technical prowess. Moreover, it plans to release its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) sometime in the fourth quarter this year, so it continues to work to maintain this lead.\n\nThe financials confirm this popularity: Revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28) was $56 billion, a 171% increase from year-ago levels. Its net income surpassed $31 billion, a 284% increase.\n\nUnfortunately for those who want to buy, such growth has driven valuations into the stratosphere. Although its trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 58 is unlikely to deter some investors, a 32 price-to-sales ratio is expensive no matter the performance.\n\nAnd the price-to-book-value ratio of 52 is more than 10 times AMD's multiple of 5. That leaves Nvidia with no margin for error, likely explaining why the stock fell even after the company posted impressive growth numbers for the fiscal second quarter.\n\nAnd that's the problem. Expectations and valuations are so high that the stock has to give its shareholders a near-perfect earnings report, a high bar even for Nvidia.\n\nThis is not to say that its growth story is over. With Allied Market Research estimating a compound annual growth rate of 38% for the AI chip industry through 2032, Nvidia should still grow in the long term.\n\nHowever, the high valuation makes the near-term picture uncertain. Until valuations pull back significantly, you should probably refrain from adding shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 7 Best Performing Long Term Stocks in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other best performing long term stocks in 2024.\n\nAfter the latest 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market has been performing well. All of the major market indices have been in the green since then and experts are taking it as a good sign.\n\nWe discussed the Fed’s rate cut in our article about the best day trading stocks. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n“…the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to lower its policy interest rate by 50 basis points, a move intended to ease monetary policy. Powell explained that this action reflects growing confidence that labor market strength can be maintained, while inflation continues to decrease toward the Fed’s target. Powell emphasized the Fed’s flexibility in its approach and noted that future rate changes will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic landscape.\n\nWhen questioned about the likelihood of future rate cuts, Powell said that each decision would be data-driven and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. The Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests a federal funds rate of 4.4% by the end of the year, with further reductions expected in the years ahead, which points to expectations of lower inflation and slightly higher unemployment.”\n\nUnderstanding the Current Stock Market Optimism\n\nLead writer for Markets Live at The Wall Street Journal, Gunjan Banerji also shares the market’s optimistic sentiment as she explained in an interview with CNBC on September 25. Banerji discussed the growing optimism in the stock market despite ongoing bullish sentiment for the past few years. She highlighted how the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve boosted market confidence, with the VIX (volatility index) dropping to its lowest levels and other indicators like high-yield bonds and options showing continued belief in the rally.\n\nDominic Chu of CNBC expressed concerns about potential market overconfidence, given the calmness amid geopolitical risks, the upcoming U.S. presidential election, and consumer spending challenges. Banerji acknowledged these risks but emphasized that much of the market’s optimism is tied to the Fed’s actions, with people reassured by the larger-than-expected rate cut.\n\nFinally, Banerji pointed out a broadening of the market rally beyond the tech sector and mentioned the strong performances in sectors like energy and materials, and record highs from companies like Caterpillar and McDonald’s, which indicates a healthier, more diverse market rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify nearly 60 mid to mega-cap stocks with year-to-date share price returns of over 100%. Next, we narrowed our list to 7 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside, as of September 24. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 elite hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best Performing Long Term Stock in 2024?\n\nIs NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best Performing Long Term Stock in 2024?\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 24.10%\n\nStock Price Performance YTD: 150.92%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a powerhouse in the technology sector, known for its work in graphics processing units and AI. It was originally focused on advancing the gaming experience but has now transformed the landscape of computer graphics with the launch of its GPU in 1999, which significantly improved video game performance and 3D applications.\n\nOver the years, the company has broadened its product range to include central processing units, data processing units, and various software solutions tailored for high-performance computing and deep learning. Today, it serves a wide range of industries, including gaming, professional visualization, data centers, automotive, and healthcare.\n\nIt takes its place on our list of the best performing long term stocks in 2024. The stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating from 64 analysts. As of September 24, the average price target of $150.00 represents an upside of 24.10% from the present levels.\n\nOne of the most eagerly awaited developments is the Blackwell product line. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) forecasts substantial revenue from this new series, which promises to be a game-changer in the field. The order book for both the current Hopper chip lineup and its successor, Blackwell, is strong.\n\nThe products feature advanced technology that allows clusters of NVIDIA chips to function as cohesive units that process massive amounts of data and execute computations at unprecedented speeds. This is especially valuable for training the neural networks that power modern AI applications.\n\nDemand for the company’s existing products remains strong, and as supply chains improve, orders for the Blackwell range are steadily increasing. CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that the company is ramping up production of the Blackwell GPU and is on track to begin shipments in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile some engineering challenges have arisen that may delay certain product releases, the overall momentum is positive, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is ready to scale production as it moves into the next year.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was held by 179 hedge funds in the second quarter and the stakes amounted to $53.67 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company and has a position worth $11.54 billion as of Q2.\n\nIthaka Group stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best performing long-term stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Huawei's AI chips take another step forward as Chinese firms look for Nvidia alternatives",
        "content": "US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies has started testing a new artificial intelligence (AI) chip with potential clients in China as companies look for alternatives to high-end Nvidia chips, edging closer to another breakthrough in China's self-sufficiency push in semiconductors despite US restrictions.\n\nHuawei has offered samples of its Ascend 910C processor to large Chinese server companies for hardware testing and configuration, according to two sources briefed by the matter. The chip, an upgraded version of the 910B, is being offered to large Chinese internet firms, which are also major Nvidia customers, according to one of the sources, a distributor of Huawei AI chips.\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has been racing to fill a void left by Nvidia after Washington banned the California-based chip designer from shipping its most sophisticated graphics processing units (GPUs) to China. The Ascend 910B chips, which Huawei has called on par with Nvidia's popular A100 chips, have become a top alternative in multiple industries across the country. Its Ascend solutions were used to train roughly half of more than 70 of China's top large language models as of last year, according to Huawei.\n\nThe Chinese tech giant has closely guarded its progress in chip advancements, but it is clear that Huawei is building a support system for the domestic AI industry. Huawei rotating chairman Eric Xu Zhijun, said a week ago that Huawei has built two computing businesses in the past five years to create another option that can meet enterprises' AI infrastructure needs.\n\n\"The reality is that US restrictions on AI chips for China are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon,\" Xu said. However, he noted that this has created an opportunity for the company to offer computing resources via its cloud services operation.\n\nOne of the sources who works with a server company said Huawei often bundles its solutions. \"If we buy Huawei's AI chips, then we have to buy other things from Huawei, such as its network solutions and storage solutions, which makes some hesitate,\" the person said. Most of Huawei AI chips on the market are still 910B, according to a telecoms source working with Huawei on GPUs in Shenzhen.\n\nNvidia, for which China was its third-largest market in the financial year ended January 28, is one of the most prominent tech firms bearing the brunt of increasingly stringent US sanctions on China's access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia was first barred from selling its A100 and H100 GPUs - two of the most in-demand chips for training and running AI models - to clients in China in August 2022. It later modified those chips to create the A800 and H800 to get around those restrictions, which Washington in turn barred from export to China last October.\n\nThis cat-and-mouse game - condemned by US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo - has continued. Nvidia has since developed the H20, L20 and L2 GPUs in an effort to maintain its market share in China.\n\nDemand for the H20 was initially tepid, but sales have picked up steadily in recent months. Using a chip that is US rule-compliant with the US is more important for large Chinese cloud service providers because it gives them access to Nvidia's technical support and maintenance services.\n\nNvidia is expected to deliver more than 1 million H20 GPUs in China this year, racking up US$12 billion in sales.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Surge Into 2025. Here's Why.",
        "content": "After a blistering run since early 2023, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has hit a wall. The stock has surged 730% since the start of last year (as of this writing), but over the past three months, Nvidia has tread water, down roughly 4%.\n\nA number of factors have weighed on the stock. Fears regarding a potential slowdown in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), rumors about a delayed release of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, concerns about a decline in the company's gross margin, and a pricey valuation have some investors fearing the stock may have gotten ahead of itself.\n\nHowever, a quick look at the available evidence suggests that while those concerns are understandable, they are also largely unfounded. I believe there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to run, and I predict the stock will continue to reach new all-time highs into 2025. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA speed bump in the adoption of AI?\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has helped fuel the run-up in technology stocks since the start of 2023, but investors have begun to wonder if that breakneck pace could continue. There's evidence that suggests it can.\n\nTo close out the calendar second quarter, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platformsallannounced plans to increase capital expenditures (capex) for the remainder of 2024, while also laying out plans for significant increases next year. The vast majority of that spending will be allocated to outfitting the servers and data centers needed to support AI. Since these tech titans are Nvidia's biggest customers, this suggests the company's growth streak has legs.\n\nTaking a step back and looking at the big picture can also provide context. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy in the coming years, according to estimates provided by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. This suggests that the adoption of AI will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nBlackwell is on track\n\nReports emerged in early August that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips would be delayed by as much as three months due to production issues. The stock skidded on these reports as investors feared the worst.\n\nWhen Nvidia released its quarterly results in late August, CFO Colette Kress put the matter to rest:\n\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis suggests the reported delays were much ado about nothing.\n\nFears regarding slowing growth are myopic\n\nWhen Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), there was much to like. The company generated record quarterly revenue, record quarterly data center revenue, and robust profits. However, there were two issues investors seemed to focus on in Nvidia's otherwise stellar results.\n\nThe first was the company's gross margin, which declined from a record 78.4% in Q1 to 75.1% in Q2. During the earnings conference call, CFO Colette Kress noted that a combination of product mix and inventory provisions related to the rollout of Blackwell were the culprits.\n\nThat said, the company is forecasting gross margins for the remainder of the year in the mid-70% range. While that's below the record results in the first quarter, it's still well ahead of Nvidia's 10-year average gross margin of 62%. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe other issue that seemed to spook some investors was Nvidia's forecast for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in late October. The company is guiding for record revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent growth of 79%. That would mark a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia has delivered in each of the previous five quarters, but it's still a remarkable performance nonetheless.\n\nSavvy investors knew that the company's growth rate would eventually slow, particularly as Nvidia faces tough comps from last year. That said, the company's revenue growth is still exceptional and should be viewed in that context.\n\nNot as pricey as you might think\n\nOne of the biggest issues weighing on Nvidia is the notion that the stock is exorbitantly expensive. That view is certainly understandable, given that the stock is currently selling for 57 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 30 for the S&P 500. However, investors willing to take a step back will see that Nvidia isn't as expensive as it might appear at first glance.\n\nA quick look at the stock chart reveals that Nvidia is actually trading slightly lower than its average P/E ratio over the past decade. It's also worth noting that during the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has gained more than 25,000%, evidence that the stock has been -- and continues to be -- deserving of a premium. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, a look ahead suggests the stock is even cheaper. Wall Street is forecasting earnings per share of $4.02 for the coming fiscal year, which kicks off in late January. That means Nvidia is currently trading for less than 29 times forward earnings (as of this writing), which is a bargain, particularly given the company's continuing growth prospects.\n\nAn objective view\n\nGiven the run-up of Nvidia stock since early last year, it's understandable that investors are taking a step back to survey the landscape. Yet it's clear the factors that have been weighing on the stock are much ado about nothing.\n\nNvidia's largest customers continue to spend heavily on its products, its next-generation platform is on track, its gross margin remains near a record high, and its valuation isn't nearly as pricey as it appears at first glance.\n\nThis all suggests a clear runway ahead for Nvidia, and I predict that the stock will continue to reach new heights well into 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A recent report from UBS Global Wealth Management estimates that artificial intelligence revenue will reach $1.2 trillion by 2027. The analysts believe \"AI will be the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history.\"\n\nThe report breaks the investment opportunity into three layers: (1) the enabling layer, (2) the intelligence layer, and (3) the application layer. Listed below are three brilliant AI stocks (one for each layer) that billionaires were buying in the second quarter.\n\nAndreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors bought 1.3 million shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors bought 1.1 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). David Shaw at D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 689,000 shares of Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG).\n\nHere's what investors should about those stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia: The enabling layer\n\nUBS analysts define the first stage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom as the enabling layer. It comprises semiconductor companies and public clouds that provide infrastructure and platform services required to develop AI applications. UBS estimates revenue from the enabling layer will total $516 billion by 2027.\n\nNvidia fits neatly into this category. The most obvious reason for its inclusion is dominance in data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and it holds 90% market share in AI chips according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia also provides software libraries and developer tools through its CUDA platform that streamline the building of GPU-accelerated applications. Additionally, the company has also launched a complete AI-as-a-service product called DGX Cloud. It brings together supercomputing infrastructure, pretrained machine learning models, and software that support AI application development across use cases ranging from autonomous robots to recommender systems.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia is well positioned to hold its leadership position in AI chips despite increasingly tough competition from semiconductor companies like AMD and Broadcom. To quote Forrester Research, \"The company's innovation, roadmap, and vision are clear and have kept it moving at lightspeed compared to other semiconductor manufacturers for AI chips.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to compound at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 57 times earnings look like a reasonable entry point. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is a material discount to the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon: The intelligence layer\n\nUBS analysts define the second stage of the artificial intelligence boom as the intelligence layer. It comprises companies that use data assets to build the large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models that power artificial intelligence applications. UBS estimates revenue from the intelligence layer will total $255 billion in 2027.\n\nAmazon fits neatly into the first and second categories. Amazon Web Services, the largest public cloud in terms of revenue, provides access to infrastructure and platform services that support the development of AI models and applications. Amazon Bedrock is one example. It's a generative AI development platform that lets businesses fine-tune pretrained models, including the Titan family of models developed by Amazon.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon shoppers spend $443,000 per minute on the marketplace, according to Goldman Sachs. That affords the company a deep understanding of consumer tastes and preference, and its generative AI shopping assistant (Rufus) uses that information to answer questions and make product recommendations. As of Sept. 18, Rufus is officially available to all U.S. customers.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of IT executives from Goldman Sachs, approximately 30% of applications run in public clouds today, but that number is projected to approach 50% in three years. As the largest public cloud, Amazon Web Services is uniquely positioned to benefit as demand for AI services increases, simply because it already has the largest customer base and partner ecosystem.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 22% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 45 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 2.1, a discount to the three-year average of 2.9.\n\n3. Datadog: The application layer\n\nUBS analysts define the third stage of the artificial intelligence boom as the application layer. It comprises companies that use data assets and models from the intelligence layer to develop AI software. UBS estimates revenue from the application layer will total $395 billion in 2027.\n\nDatadog fits into this category. The company specializes in observability software. Its platform comprises a broad range of products that help businesses monitor, troubleshoot, and evaluate the performance of critical IT infrastructure and applications. Several products depend on AI. For instance, Watchdog is an AI engine that accelerates incident resolution by automating anomaly detection and root cause analysis\n\nSimilarly, Bits AI is a conversational interface that lets development and operations teams query observability data using natural language. It simplifies investigations, streamlines incident management, and speeds up the remediation of performance problems. Likewise, LLM Observability is a monitoring tool purpose-built for the large language models that power generative AI applications.\n\nResearch company Gartner recently ranked Datadog as a leading observability platform vendor for the fourth consecutive year. The company also has a strong presence in several individual observability verticals, such as log analysis, sever monitoring, and application performance monitoring. Additionally, Forrester Research has recognized its leadership in AI for IT operations.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh views Datadog as one of the software companies best positioned to monetize generative AI. Wall Street expects the company's revenue to grow at 23% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 17.9 times sales look like a reasonable entry point for patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio for Q4: Top 11 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the importance of using short-term rallies to your advantage. He said that investors should know when to take the chips off the table.\n\n“The idea that you should buy and hold through both the best of times and worst of times is probably incredibly foolish, with only very few exceptions,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that if the stock you bought is going higher and higher and you keep resisting the urge to take some profits, you won’t make any actual money from these gains if the stock comes down later paring all these profits. This seems straightforward but the idea of buying low and selling high is easier said than done, Cramer said.\n\n“Don’t get carried away by the optimism. Instead, keep your head on straight, check your emotions, focus on long term and think about ringing the register, especially on stocks that might be getting too high,” Cramer added.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. We also picked an interesting prediction Cramer made back in 2021 about a stock and saw how it turned out. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Top Stock to Buy and Sell in Q4 According to Jim Cramer?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nIn December 2021, long before ChatGPT was launched or using trending words like “hyperscalers” or “LLM” was fashion, Jim Cramer made some prescient comments about the chipmaker during a program on CNBC.\n\n“I just went there and I saw things, I went time-traveling with Jensen Huang. I am being a pig in NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) because this may be a $10 trillion stock.”\n\nBack then, NVDA was trading at around $29 and today it’s at $123.\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio for Q4: Top 11 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 9 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer is exuberant about the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate cut.\n\n“Believe me, there are few things more friendly than a 50 basis point rate cut,” Cramer said in a recent program.\n\nThe CNBC host said that he has reminded his viewers repeatedly that when the Fed is your “enemy” you should stick to recession-proof stocks that can produce consistent earnings despite market slowdowns.\n\n“Once the Fed is done tightening and we start seeing signs of impending rate cuts you need to load up on the cyclicals, the companies that see massive earnings growth when the economy accelerates,” Cramer reminded his viewers about his advice on how to play the interest-rate game.\n\nJim Cramer has been talking about all sorts of stocks during his latest programs. In this article we picked 9 important stocks he’s bearish/bullish on and analyzed these companies in detail. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) Top Stock to Buy and Sell Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio?\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 92\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program agreed with a caller who asked him whether he’d buy more Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) shares on a pullback.\n\n“On a pullback, absolutely. Vertiv is a premier data center stock.”\n\nCramer said Vertiv is a “winner.”\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a market leader in the data center power and cooling market, which has nowhere to go but up from here since companies are hungry for data center solutions as they begin to deploy AI software.\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is forming long-term partnerships with Intel and Nvidia to develop tailored solutions for their products. This is especially notable because AI training requires significantly more electricity and produces more heat than traditional servers, driving demand for specialized systems that Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) provides. The company estimates that the additional demand from AI could boost its top-line growth by up to 4% annually.\n\nBy designing products specifically for Nvidia’s GPUs, Vertiv can tap into Nvidia’s growth with minimal effort, as their systems are crucial for optimizing GPU performance. If Nvidia powers data centers with its processors, Vertiv provides the infrastructure that keeps them running efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) revenue has grown on average at 10% in the most recent quarters. The company has a backlog of over $7 billion, more than a year’s worth of current revenue. Vertiv is targeting a 20% operating margin by 2028.\n\nBaron Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) a leading provider of critical digital infrastructure for data centers, contributed during the quarter. As an industry leader in data center cooling and power management, Vertiv is poised to benefit from AI-driven growth in data center spend. The NVIDIA partner network, strong industry relationships, and broad product portfolio that Vertiv maintains enables its participation in the creation of the technology roadmap for the future of the data center. In addition, Vertiv is investing in its capacity to serve this growing end market more effectively. The company also has an extensive global service network to aid customers as they grow. We believe the company has durable competitive advantages and a flexible balance sheet to benefit from the expected significant capital investment in data centers for years to come. Vertiv reported very strong results for the March quarter, with orders up 60%, which highlighted the strong demand it is seeing for its products. We sold some of our position into strength after the runup from the positive report, but still hold a major position in the Fund as we see considerable upside in the shares over time.”\n\nOverall, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 9 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Since its IPO in January 1999, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has established itself as one of the world's most successful companies. It has been particularly adept at adapting its technology to expand into new markets.\n\nThe company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized the gaming industry, turning boxy figures into lifelike images. The secret to its success was parallel processing, which allowed the chips to conduct a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. Nvidia's processors are now used for product design, autonomous systems, cloud computing, data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), and more.\n\nThe ability to adapt its technology has been a boon to shareholders. Even if investors didn't get in on the IPO itself, Nvidia shares fell below their issue price numerous times in early 1999. For investors fortunate enough to get shares at (or below) the $12 IPO price, the stock has returned 493,940%.\n\nMultiplying like rabbits\n\nWhile a single share of stock might seem inconsequential at first glance, one share of the right stock can have a huge impact on an investor's success. In Nvidia's case, the company's performance and soaring stock price have resulted in numerous stock splits, turning one share into many more.\n\nHere's a list of Nvidia's stock splits over the years:\n\n2-for-1 split, June 27, 2000 2-for-1 split, Sept. 12, 2001 2-for-1 split, April 7, 2006 3-for-2 split, Sept. 11, 2007 4-for-1 split, July 20, 2021 10-for-1 split, June 10, 2024\n\nAs a result of the multiple stock splits, an investor who bought just one share of Nvidia stock near its IPO in 1999 would now be the proud owner of 480 shares.\n\nHowever, it took a great deal of discipline and self-control to hold Nvidia for more than 25 years and reap this windfall. The stock has lost more than half its value on numerous occasions, which sent fair-weather investors scrambling for the exits.\n\nThat said, consider this: A $1,000 investment in Nvidia made in early 1999 would now be worth more than $4.9 million.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "David Tepper, the CEO of Appaloosa Management, is one of the best-known hedge fund managers working today.\n\nTepper has a net worth of $21.3 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world. He's known for, among other things, taking a contrarian approach to investing, zigging while others are zagging.\n\nTepper's latest moves are an excellent example of that philosophy. In the second quarter, Appaloosa Management dumped shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), arguably the most popular stock on the market, and piled into some of the most beaten-down, unloved stocks available. Take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOut with Nvidia\n\nTepper's fund dumped 3.73 million shares of Nvidia, or roughly $450 million worth of the top artificial intelligence (AI) stock, in Q2. That wasn't quite all of Appaloosa's stake. But it was more than 84% of it, leaving the fund with just 690,000 shares, representing roughly $90 million worth of the stock.\n\nThe Appaloosa boss hasn't directly commented on selling Nvidia, but he's one of several billionaire hedge fund managers to do so in Q2. Many seem to believe that the so-called easy money has been made with Nvidia. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller also sold the stock recently, saying that the market now recognizes what he recognized at the start of the AI boom.\n\nFor Tepper, the Q2 sale continued a pattern. He dumped 3.48 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, even as the stock surged over that period.\n\nAppaloosa also sold a number of other chip stocks in Q2, indicating a broader rotation out of the sector. Among those it sold were Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. It also trimmed its position in \"AI stocks\" like Amazon, Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\n\nHowever, what Tepper was buying instead was even more surprising.\n\nIn with China stocks\n\nChina stocks have been in trouble for the last five years, falling sharply from their pandemic peak. A crackdown on the tech sector by Beijing and a weak recovery post-COVID have combined to make the sector a laggard.\n\nIn fact, as the chart below shows, the iSharesMSCI China ETF is down 12% over the last five years, getting trounced by the S&P 500, which has nearly doubled in that time. MCHI Chart\n\nHowever, Appaloosa seems to smell an opportunity in China, as the fund bought a number of Chinese stocks in Q2.\n\nAppaloosa added more than 1 million shares of the Kraneshares CSI China InternetETF (NYSEMKT: KWEB), which counts Tencent and Alibaba as its top two holdings.\n\nThe fund also added more than 660,000 shares of leading e-commerce stock JD.com, 565,000 shares of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSEMKT: FXI), and 380,000 shares of KE Holdings, a Chinese real estate services company.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Appaloosa actually trimmed its stake in Alibaba, that Chinese e-commerce stock remained his top holding, making up 12.2% of the Appaloosa portfolio.\n\nThe fund first bought shares of Alibaba in Q2 2022. He's acquired the other Chinese stocks more recently, mostly within the last year.\n\nWhy Tepper is buying China\n\nTepper hasn't explained his bullishness on China, but he likely thinks the sector is oversold and due for a recovery.\n\nAnyone with a bullish bet on China got some good news on Tuesday when Chinese stocks soared on surprise interest rate cuts, the government's biggest effort to stimulate the economy since the pandemic.\n\nIndeed, Chinese stocks jumped on the news. The iShares MSCI China ETF was up 9% in afternoon trading, showing perhaps greater upside potential in the sector.\n\nShould you follow Tepper's Appaloosa into China?\n\nThe Chinese economy is still generally weak, but the rate cuts could be a sign that the government plans to do more to boost that economy. Even so, most Chinese stocks, like Alibaba and JD.com, have put up underwhelming growth numbers in recent quarters, which is why the stocks have generally lagged.\n\nTepper and his team at Appaloosa seem to believe that those stocks have hit rock bottom, and any good news would prompt a turnaround. That theory seems reasonable, but investors have been saying that for years, and China has continued to struggle.\n\nRate cuts notwithstanding, investors still seem better off exercising cautiousness in China. Beijing is unpredictable, the economy is lagging, and new chip export restrictions from the U.S. and others could further impair its recovery.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 3 Supercharged Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth $4 Trillion by 2025, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "One of the clearest secular tailwinds of the past couple of years is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in the field have helped power the ongoing market rally, as these next-generation algorithms promise to increase productivity by handling mundane tasks and streamlining productivity.\n\nIt should come as no surprise then that many of the world's most valuable companies are at the forefront of AI development and have embraced the potential of generative AI. One of the biggest debates in tech circles is which of these technology stalwarts will be the first to cross the $4 trillion market cap threshold.\n\nInvestors asking that question may be missing the point, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who argues that 12 months from now, the $4 trillion club might, in fact, have three members. Let's take a look at the candidates and what might drive them there. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWith the world's largest current market cap, coming in at more than $3.4 trillion (as of this writing), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is among the most likely contenders to be a founding member of the $4 trillion club. It would take a stock price increase of less than 17% to put Apple over the finish line, and there are plenty of drivers that could help propel the iPhone maker higher.\n\nThe most obvious potential catalyst is, of course, the recently unveiled iPhone 16. The latest version of the fan-favorite device comes with all the usual upgrades, including an improved camera, speedier processing, and increased battery life. One of the biggest draws, however, is the debut of Apple Intelligence, the company's suite of generative AI-powered tools, which will likely attract technophiles in droves.\n\nThere's more: The rampant inflation of the past couple of years had consumers hanging on to their iPhones a bit longer, and Ives estimates there are 300 million iPhones that haven't been upgraded for four years or more, resulting in plenty of pent-up demand. He believes this will kick off the next supercycle and estimates Apple could sell as many as 240 million iPhones over the coming year.\n\nGiven improving macroeconomic conditions, I think the analyst is right: Throngs of consumers will pony up for the new AI-driven iPhone, helping push Apple over the $4 trillion mark.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is currently the world's second-most valuable company. With a market cap of $3.2 trillion, the stock will only need to rise 24% to cross the $4 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company was quick to recognize the game-changing nature of generative AI and positioned itself for success. Microsoft took a stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and developed a suite of AI-driven productivity tools dubbed Copilot. It recently unveiled a line of Copilot-powered personal computers that will help increase Microsoft's already expansive reach.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last month, the company announced that it would restructure the reporting of its business units to give a clearer picture of its success in AI. While investors don't yet have the complete picture, the available evidence is compelling. During Microsoft's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), its Azure Cloud grew 29% year over year, and management noted that eight percentage points of that growth was the result of demand for its AI services. This helps illustrate that Microsoft's AI strategy is paying off.\n\nIves seized on one point from management's commentary, noting that Azure Cloud growth is expected to \"accelerate in the second half.\" He estimates that over the coming three years, 70% of Microsoft's installed base will be using its AI solutions. He goes on to say this opportunity is not yet fully factored into the stock price.\n\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head. Given Microsoft's extensive reach in both the consumer and enterprise markets, it won't take much in terms of AI adoption to positively impact the company's growth.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the de facto poster child for the AI revolution, sending its market cap to just over $3 trillion. As such, it would only take a stock price increase of 32% to take the chipmaker above $4 trillion.\n\nThe stock currently sits 10% off its peak, as investors contemplate the momentum of AI adoption, yet the evidence is incontrovertible. Nvidia's largest customers -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- have been completely transparent about their plans to increase their capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and into 2025. They have also made it very clear that the vast majority of that spending will be dedicated to the data centers and servers needed to run AI.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for running AI in data centers and controlled 98% of the data center GPU market last year. This illustrates why continued investment in the space stands to benefit Nvidia.\n\nIves cited surging chip demand, clarity on the upcoming release of its Blackwell chip, and robust outlook as proof that Nvidia stock has further to run.\n\nI think the analyst's assessment is spot on. Investors have been concerned that AI adoption could slow, which has weighed on Nvidia stock in recent months. However, while that will certainly happen one day, the available evidence suggests it won't happen any time soon. In fact, some believe Nvidia will eventually be the world's most valuable company.\n\nA word on valuation\n\nExcitement regarding the potential for AI since early last year has driven many stocks higher, resulting in a corresponding increase in their respective valuations. As such, each of these stocks is trading at a premium to the broader market. Microsoft and Apple are currently selling for roughly 33 times forward earnings, compared to a multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. Nvidia is the most egregious example, selling for 43 times forward earnings. That said, looks can be deceiving.\n\nAnalysts' consensus estimates for Nvidia's earnings per share for its 2026 fiscal year (which begins in January) is $4.02. On that basis, Nvidia is only trading for 30 times sales, so it isn't as expensive as it might appear, particularly given the ongoing opportunity represented by AI. Using next fiscal year's expectations yields similar results for Apple and Microsoft, which are selling for 30 times and 28 times next year's expected earnings, respectively.\n\nWhen viewed in that light, these tech titans are actually reasonably priced. That's why each of these stocks is a must-own for the AI revolution.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 773% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 168% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 23, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "title": "China Discourages Local Companies from Buying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Chips",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) closed down 2% on Sept. 27 after media reports surfaced that China’s government is discouraging domestic companies from buying Nvidia’s microchips and processors.\n\nBloomberg News, and other media outlets, are reporting that government officials in Beijing are calling on Chinese businesses to source artificial intelligence (AI) microchips produced within China, and to avoid Nvidia’s chips, which are among the most powerful in the world.\n\nThe pressure to buy local comes as the Chinese government tries to bolster its domestic semiconductor industry amid an ongoing trade spat with the U.S. China’s Ministry of Information and Technology has singled out Nvidia’s H20 series of chips, which are used to power AI models and applications, saying domestic companies should not buy those chips.\n\nEscalating Tensions Over Microchips\n\nOfficials in Beijing have stopped short of an outright ban on Nvidia’s microchips in the nation of 1.4 billion people. Rather, government officials say they are providing “guidance” to local companies and encouraging the purchase of Chinese made products.\n\nThe renewed focus on buying Chinese microchips and semiconductors comes amid escalating tensions with the U.S. over the technology. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has imposed export controls on microchips and processors to China, citing concerns that the technology will be used to further develop the country’s military capabilities.\n\nChina has accounted for 25% of Nvidia’s annual revenues in the past. In recent months, the chipmaker had found ways to continue selling its high-end microchips to Chinese companies without violating American export controls. Essentially, Nvidia is selling chips to China that are based on its popular H100 microchip but that have 50% less computing power.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia’s stock has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 42 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 39 Buy and three Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. There are no Sell ratings on the stock. The average price target of $152.44 implies 25.68% upside from current levels.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on NVDA stock\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Riskiest Real Estate Bonds Are Beating Nvidia’s Returns",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A previously gloomy corner of the debt world has become the biggest winning trade in global financial markets, producing returns that few traders have seen in more than a decade.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans\n\nHybrids, the riskiest slice of a real estate company’s debt, have returned more than 75% this year. For the top 10 performers for the securities also known as subordinated bonds, returns amount to about 170% in the period, beating Nvidia Corp.’s stock, the darling of the AI craze, by 20 percentage points.\n\nIt’s the kind of swift turnaround that few could have predicted when landlords around the world were creaking under the weight of higher interest rates and changing work habits following the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, real estate debt is becoming an early winner from major central banks cutting borrowing costs amid a pivot to prioritizing the economy over battling inflation.\n\n“I cannot recall something similar in my career,” said Andrea Seminara, chief executive officer at London-based Redhedge Asset Management, who started working in finance at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008. “The magnitude of the gains is unprecedented, unless we look at pure distressed situations.”\n\nReplacement Cost\n\nLandlords’ subordinated bonds had plunged nearly 50% after central banks began to increase rates in 2022. Higher borrowing costs meant the cost to replace them shot up, leaving investors fearful that repayment would be delayed indefinitely.\n\nCompanies can also sometimes skip coupons on the notes without triggering a default, making them less popular with investors.\n\n“These bonds were punished due to technical factors,” said Andreas Meyer, founder of Hamburg-based Fountain Square Asset Management. “There was blood on the streets.”\n\nFor Seminara, buying at those depressed levels was effectively a bet that companies would be able to replace debt that was coming due and that falling inflation would allow central banks to cut interest rates. Both proved correct.\n\nThe companies faced a so-called maturity wall that collapsed in historic fashion this year as capital flowed into the credit market, allowing landlords to issue new debt to refinance old bonds. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve this month joined the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in cutting its policy rate and leaving open the possibility of further large cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeyer’s event-driven fund is among those that reaped the benefits, gaining as much as 80% in its hybrid bonds. He still has exposure in the sector.\n\nThe main risk now is that there is little juice left in the trade. Strategists Barnaby Martin and Ioannis Angelakis at Bank of America Corp. flagged in a report last week that “valuations are clearly nearer to becoming full” in real estate credit.\n\nStill, buyers and sellers are becoming more confident that the commercial real estate market is bottoming out. Many want to start putting capital to work as the interest rate pain starts to ease.\n\n“We have lived through a sh*tstorm. No one has lived through a monetary policy as aggressive as we have seen in the last two years,” Madison International Realty founder Ron Dickerman said in an interview. “A couple of rate cuts does not make a market, but there’s optimism.”\n\nWeek in Review\n\nChina disclosed a series of stimulus measures designed to boost flagging growth in the nation. It unveiled its biggest package yet to shore up its beleaguered property market, lowering borrowing costs on as much as $5.3 trillion in mortgages and easing down-payment requirements for second home purchases to a historical low.\n\nChina is also considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy. While some details are missing, the unusual pace and intensity of the stimulus announcements signaled a sense of urgency in Beijing to put growth on track for the around 5% target, buoying market sentiment. Separately, the nation began marketing its first euro-denominated bond in three years. US companies and Asian issuers stormed debt markets following the Federal Reserve’s decision last week to lower its benchmark interest rate by half-a-percentage-point. A resurgence in mergers and acquisitions dealmaking is turbocharging the US high-grade bond market to its fastest pace of issuance since 2020, putting it on track to post $1.5 trillion of sales. Banks and other lenders are lining up more than €10 billion ($11.1 billion) of debt to back a buyout of Sanofi SA’s consumer health division, as one of the most hotly-anticipated sales of the year reaches its final stages. Blue Owl Capital Inc. led the $3.2 billion private debt financing supporting Blackstone Inc. and Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software firm Smartsheet Inc., with 20 other lenders participating. Citigroup Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. are teaming up in the fast-growing private credit market, agreeing to work together on $25 billion worth of deals over the next five years. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s structured credit business Atlas SP Partners received its broker-dealer license and is preparing to start secondary trading. Country Garden Holdings Co. has won bondholders’ approval to push back payments on its nine yuan bonds by six months, giving the developer more time to map out an onshore debt overhaul. Credit Agricole SA is looking to raise capital with a bond that has to be repaid after only a decade, adding to a recent raft of longer-duration instruments as investors look to take advantage of the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts. Altice France has held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, a move that would potentially hurt existing creditors. A group of banks led by Bank of America Corp. sweetened terms on a leveraged loan offering to help finance Platinum Equity’s acquisition of GSM Outdoors as the deal struggled to attract demand from investors. Dish Network Corp. is close to striking a deal with some of its convertible bondholders that would give the company new financing and help it extend its debt maturities. Hooters of America is huddling with lenders and advisers amid revenue declines that pushed the restaurant chain to shutter several of its locations.\n\nOn the Move\n\nBrian Sauvigne, a former Blackstone Inc. senior managing director, rejoined Bank of Montreal’s financial-sponsors group. RBC Capital Markets hired Sam Pfeiffer, previously with Morgan Stanley, as head of US investment grade systematic credit trading. M&G Investments recruited Joe Sullivan-Bissett to be an investment director in its £137 billion fixed income division, reporting to David Parsons, head of the fixed income specialist team. Alberta Investment Management Corp. appointed David Scudellari, the fund’s head of international investment, to oversee private assets and strategic partnerships, and Justin Lord as senior executive managing director for public markets.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Is Still a Long-Term Winner, No Matter the Noise",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) prodigy Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s third-highest-valued stock, experienced a material decline in market capitalization following its Q2 earnings in late August. However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold.  My thesis remains unchanged — I’m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential.\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term AI-Driven Growth Trajectory Remains Intact\n\nIt is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia’s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses.\n\nThere’s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That’s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver.\n\nNVDA Remains a One-Stop AI Powerhouse with Margin Growth\n\nAnother reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang‘s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand.\n\nThis strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA’s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.\n\nFor context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today’s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.\n\nDemand for NVDA’s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.\n\nA Discussion of Nvidia’s Impressive Quarterly Earnings\n\nNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.\n\nThe company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts’ projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company’s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA’s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.\n\nNvidia’s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with revenues expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.\n\nNVDA’s Insider Selling Concerns are Over\n\nInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it’s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.\n\nNotably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.\n\nNVDA Valuation Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Growth Prowess\n\nInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock’s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company’s and slowing growth.\n\nOn the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA’s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA’s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.\n\nGiven NVDA’s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia’s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nWith 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44 implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.\n\nIn the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.\n\nRead full Disclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "You Can Do Better Than the S&amp;P 500. Buy This ETF Instead.",
        "content": "There's nothing wrong with the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)market index.\n\nIt reflects the overall health of the American stock market, with a quality filter based on market capitalization. Investing in this market tracker through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the SPDR S&P 500 Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) gives you a ton of diversification and sets you up for robust long-term returns.\n\nIf you invested $1,000 in the SPDR fund 10 years ago and set the position up to reinvest dividend payments in more shares, you would have $3,500 today. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2%, leaving inflation rates far behind. Many investors get started in a popular SPDR 500 fund and let it run for decades, building wealth with zero investor effort.\n\nBut what if I told you that there are ETFs with even better long-term returns? For instance, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) tends to beat the S&P 500's returns in the long haul. It's one of my favorite ETFs. Let me show you how it works. VGT Total Return Price Chart\n\nWhy this Vanguard fund is one of my favorite ETFs for long-term growth\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, the Vanguard IT ETF has been crushing the S&P 500 and its index trackers over the last decade. The total returns work out to a CAGR of 20.9%. Over this period, a hypothetical $1,000 investment would have grown to $6,678.\n\nAnd that's just a simple one-time move with no further cash investments added over time. Let's imagine an automated dollar-cost averaging plan instead, starting with just $100 in the fall of 2014 and adding another $100 to that Vanguard IT ETF position per month. Some investors can do this as a paycheck deduction, others might set up automatic transfers, and a few may prefer doing it by hand.\n\nWhatever method you use, these fairly painless contributions would add up to $12,000 in a decade. The investment returns would be roughly $29,000, working out to a total investment value of $41,118.\n\nDoing the same thing with the SPDR S&P 500 fund instead would have yielded respectable results, too. The same $12,000 investment should be worth $25,174 by now, more than doubling your money in 10 years.\n\nLike I said, there's nothing wrong with that. Still, I'd rather have the stronger returns from the IT market tracker.\n\nThere's no reward without additional risks\n\nOf course, I can't promise market-stomping returns over every conceivable time period. The fund underperformed the S&P 500 in its first five years on the market, ending amid the subprime market meltdown of 2008-2009. The inflation crisis of 2022 was no fun for Vanguard IT ETF investors, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn challenging markets like these hand-picked examples, the ETF's focus on high-growth investment ideas can result in deeply negative returns. I had to search for these unfavorable examples, and this ETF tends to beat the S&P 500 over long time periods.\n\nStill, this might not be the fund for you if you can't afford the occasional price drop along the way. The fund outperforms in most cases, but it can really hurt when growth stocks run into a brick wall.\n\nHow this ETF's portfolio differs from the S&P 500\n\nThe fund follows a market index reflecting all American stocks in the information technology sector, resulting in a list of 317 names at the latest update.\n\nThey are weighted by market cap. Therefore, tech titans Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are the three largest holdings these days. These three stocks add up to roughly 48% of the total portfolio.\n\nThe same three companies also dominate the S&P 500, but their combined weight stops at just 20% right now. The IT index includes many stocks that are too small for the S&P 500.\n\nSo the IT-focused fund places a heavier load on the largest companies, but also lets smaller businesses contribute to the total score. It's a different balancing act that raises market risks but also the potential returns.\n\nIs the Vanguard Information Technology ETF right for you?\n\nYou've seen the long-term returns, and I showed you the potential downsides. I don't mind if you prefer something like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF in the end. It will probably let you sleep better at night, at least in challenging periods like the market crises I highlighted earlier.\n\nI'm just happy to have shown you a more exciting option. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF isn't every investor's cup of tea, and that's OK. I highly recommend taking a sip, though. These thrilling high-growth ideas can be intoxicating over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Still a Good Investment Prospect",
        "content": "Nvidia has been an AI juggernaut for the past couple of years as it challenges for the title of the world’s most valuable corporation. Nvidia’s 156% year-to-date gain and 2,700% gain over the past five years may lead many to suspect there’s limited upside from here, but artificial intelligence is still in its early innings. Understanding the AI opportunity and Nvidia’s unique position in the industry leads me to be bullish on the stock.\n\nDiving into the AI Boom\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence has already captivated investors for multiple years, the boom is still going strong, and that leads to my optimism for NVDA stock. Corporations are making significant investments in artificial intelligence, and that demand has resulted in a projected 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034.\n\nArtificial intelligence helps businesses enhance their products and services. For example, CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been investing in Charlotte AI and other AI features to fortify its cybersecurity software. Adobe (ADBE) has also invested in artificial intelligence to help individuals and businesses create better images and videos.\n\nNvidia supplies the AI chips that power these tools. While other semiconductor firms also offer AI chips, Nvidia continues to innovate its chip offerings to stay ahead of the competition. The company is working on its new Blackwell chip, which is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nThe High Cost of AI Infrastructure\n\nRight now, artificial intelligence looks similar to the early days of the internet, in my view. The groundbreaking technology has substantial barriers to entry. Nvidia wins much of the new business, contributing to my bullish outlook for NVDA stock.\n\nBig tech companies within the Magnificent Seven have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology. Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison recently said that the company is behind on its AI infrastructure goals. Oracle will likely turn to Nvidia to close that gap, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales potentially heading Nvidia’s way. Elon Musk’s companies are also in the fray. Tesla and xAI are set to spend a combined $20 billion on AI projects in 2024 alone.\n\nCorporations aren’t flinching and seem resolved to making additional investments in 2025 and beyond. AI infrastructure is expensive to set up, maintain, and scale. This dynamic benefits Nvidia tremendously as it has established a near monopoly in the industry. According to the IDC, organizations are projected to nearly triple their AI investments by the end of 2028. This research suggests a 30% compounded annual growth rate during that stretch.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s Many Partnerships\n\nNvidia is knocking elbows with the ‘who’s who’ of big tech and publicly traded corporations. It’s another reason to feel bullish about the company’s prospects, and Nvidia’s partners have deep wallets. The AI chipmaker has partnerships with Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other titans in the industry.\n\nMany of these same tech companies have been reporting record profits. Nvidia’s biggest customers are relatively well-insulated and can continue to pour money into artificial intelligence even during an economic slowdown. The technology’s mainstream appeal is relatively new, and investments are still ramping up. Nvidia’s partnerships make it more likely that the company will continue outgrowing the broader market regardless of whether the economy stalls.\n\nEven better, key partnerships are likely to expand with age. As Nvidia continues to deliver top-class AI chips to its customers, those clients are more likely to stick with Nvidia and make further large investments. Nvidia has been working with Amazon for more than a decade, while Alphabet recently expanded its partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s Valuation Isn’t Prohibitive\n\nNvidia’s valuation is still reasonably low in considering its revenue and earnings growth rates. While a 58x trailing P/E ratio seems high, especially when compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia has been more than doubling its net income on year-over-year comparisons.\n\nOn a forward basis, Nvidia stock is priced at a 43.5x P/E ratio, making the valuation look more affordable. Furthermore, the company reported 152% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY25. High revenue growth paves the way for high net income growth. If Nvidia continues to report a few more quarters of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, the forward P/E ratio should continue to drop.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia stock is currently rated as a consensus Strong Buy among 42 Wall Street analysts. The average NVDA price target of $152.44 implies about 23% potential upside. The most optimistic price target of $200 reflects 62% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts carry 39 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings on NVDA stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia is an undisputed leader within the artificial intelligence boom. It has established a leading position in supplying the demand for AI capabilities. Nvidia has some of the best customers on the planet, and these corporations are surely to continue investing in AI even during an economic downturn.\n\nRevenue and net income growth remain superb and, when looking at forward multiples, NVDA stock doesn’t look unreasonably valued. Many Wall Street analysts feel the same way, hence the consensus Strong Buy rating. Alongside them, I continue to be bullish NVDA.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "My Favorite \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Nvidia's Not One)",
        "content": "\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks refers to a phrase coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the cohort leading the market. They are:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nTesla lagged behind the others this year due to a decreased demand for electric vehicles, but the other six have done quite well. However, a few of them have reached points where they are no longer attractive buys, leaving only a few that I'd buy right now.\n\nThere are four stocks I'm not interested in right now\n\nIf you don't have a generative artificial intelligence (AI) product, you don't belong in this group. Although Tesla isn't actively engaged in generative AI, its AI research is focused on full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which is another worthy endeavor, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nHowever, Apple was considerably late to the AI party and couldn't even get its Apple Intelligence product ready to go for the iPhone 16 launch. Couple that with the fact that Apple is extremely expensive (30 times forward earnings) with flattening revenue growth, and it quickly falls off the list of good buys.\n\nAs mentioned, the EV market is going through a downward demand wave, so I'm not interested in Tesla.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft are quite pricey, although they may still be good investments in their own right. However, they just don't have the value of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is on the rise\n\nAmazon makes the list of stocks to buy because of its resurging cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although Amazon is expensive in its own right, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 times, it has the potential to drastically decrease that price tag thanks to AWS.\n\nDespite accounting for 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, AWS accounted for 64% of its operating profit. This means that if AWS grows at a faster pace than the rest of Amazon's business, Amazon's profits will rise at a faster pace than revenue growth. Couple that with several profit-boosting initiatives, and Amazon's case to grow profits rapidly takes form.\n\nAs a result, I'm not concerned with Amazon's price tag, and it presents itself as a very attractive buy.\n\nAlphabet is much cheaper than the market\n\nAlphabet's investment case is fairly simple: It's cheap. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system has a healthy but growing ad business, which helps fund its other endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless its AI tools really take off, Alphabet's growth isn't going to be spectacular, but it will likely be consistently in the low double digits, which is enough to provide market-beating growth. Couple that with an improving operating margin and hefty stock buybacks, and you get a stock that can consistently grow earnings in the 20% range (it grew them by over 30% in Q2).\n\nDespite this, Alphabet's stock trades for 18.6 times forward earnings, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23 times forward earnings. Alphabet has the formula to steadily outperform the S&P 500, yet trades at a discount. This is a huge mismatch, and it makes the stock a screaming buy right now.\n\nMeta is rapidly growing profits and revenue\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms sneakily posted the second-highest year-over-year revenue growth of the group over the past year (behind Nvidia's incredible growth).\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta's business is driven by ads on its social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. This allows Meta to fund its AI endeavors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.\n\nBasically, Meta is doing the same thing as Alphabet -- but at a faster pace.

        "title": "Will Nvidia Stock Drop as Much as Supermicro? 3 Points to Consider.",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has pulled back since the summer as it struggled to meet ever-increasing investor expectations. However, its fall did not compare to that of one of its key partners, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), which has faced a string of confidence-rattling events.\n\nSupermicro delayed the filing of its latest 10-K on Aug. 28, a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report alleged accounting irregularities at the company. As a short-seller, Hindenburg benefits when the stock falls. Then, on Sept. 26, TheWall Street Journal reported that unnamed sources indicated the Department of Justice had launched a probe into Supermicro.\n\nStill, Supermicro stock was having a rocky time before the recent news. It's down about 60% over the past six months as I write this.\n\nNvidia has had two declines in the last 10 years that exceeded 50% and investors might be worried that a similar pullback is possible again. But that looks increasingly unlikely. Three reasons explain why.\n\n1. Nvidia holds a more substantial competitive advantage\n\nUltimately, the most crucial factor driving Nvidia stock is its lead in the AI chip market. Although companies like AMD and Qualcomm have begun to develop competing products, Nvidia is far ahead, and new releases will likely ensure it stays on top.\n\nIn contrast, Supermicro is not the only server company -- many companies can build servers with Nvidia AI chips. Supermicro has developed a niche by focusing on environmentally friendly and energy-saving servers. Nonetheless, it has to compete against companies such as Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, giving it no obvious path to industry leadership.\n\n2. Performance backs high multiples\n\nAs the market leader, Nvidia has gotten a substantial boost in its valuation. In this case, valuation goes far beyond the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). It has grown its profits so rapidly that its earnings multiple is 58. That is higher than Supermicro's 20 P/E, but you could argue Nvidia is cheap considering its triple-digit profit growth.\n\nHowever, where Nvidia's premium really stands out in its price-to-sales ratio (P/S). The market values Nvidia at about 32 times its revenue, far above Supermicro's sales multiple of 1.6.\n\nThat P/S ratio could leave Nvidia vulnerable to a massive downturn in its stock price if its growth slows down. Still, Nvidia might be able to avoid such a decline if it can continue to maintain triple-digit or high double-digit net income growth for the foreseeable future.\n\n3. Nvidia stock has more stability\n\nInvestors also need to keep in mind the history of both companies and their divergent growth paths. Interestingly, both companies came into being in the same year, 1993. And both spent decades not being seen as mainstream forces in the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro develops IT hardware that it sells in over 100 countries, and despite the extent of its business, it gained little name recognition outside its industry for years.\n\nNvidia was better known because of its long history of making popular graphics processing units (GPUs). These products were not the most crucial part of a computer and server until a few years ago. However, once data centers made GPUs a more crucial part of the IT infrastructure, the past successes positioned it to emerge as an industry leader.\n\nIn contrast, Supermicro did not achieve significant recognition until the pandemic, when demand for its cloud servers increased. When it finally became better known, the growth and recognition fostered a high level of volatility in the stock. And the recent short-seller moves as well as rumors of DOJ interest in the stock have created more volatility. And that could continue, while Nvidia faces no such pressure.\n\nNvidia is not the next Supermicro\n\nAlthough anything can happen with Nvidia stock in the near term, investors should probably not have to worry about a drop that compares to the one that Supermicro has faced in 2024.\n\nUnlike Supermicro, Nvidia is a clear technical leader in the AI industry. Moreover, it should maintain a high valuation benefiting from a technical lead and good management. In contrast, Supermicro faces struggles as it gains more name recognition and deals with controversy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SMH vs. FTXL: Which Semiconductor ETF Is Better?",
        "content": "After a brief dip this summer, semiconductor stocks are heating up again, as mainstays in the space like Micron (MU)post blowout earnings due to strong AI-related demand. The memory chip giant reported scorching 93.3% year-over-year revenue growth, and guided to record revenue of $8.7 billion for the upcoming quarter, well above analyst expectations.\n\nMicron’s results gave a jolt to the sector and illustrate that AI demand is still strong. Investors can achieve diversified exposure to the semiconductor sector as a whole via an ETF, and there are many funds with different approaches to the space.\n\nLet’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs with different strategies — the Van Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL). Ultimately I land on SMH as being the best semiconductor ETF for investors.\n\nVan Eck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nSMH is the largest and most popular semiconductor-specific ETF, and with good reason, as I’ll explain below.\n\nThe $23.4 billion fund tracks an index called the “MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index”, which is intended to reflect the aggregate performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment, according to Van Eck. Notably, SMH’s index methodology favors the largest companies in the industry, a key point which we will come back to later.\n\nSMH is a fairly concentrated bet on semiconductors. The fund holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 71.5% of assets. You can see an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings below using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs readers will note above, SMH has a massive 20.1% position in shares of Nvidia (NVDA). However, this large position has served it well, as Nvidia stock has risen nearly 200% in the past year.\n\nThe strong performance of Nvidia and other top holdings like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) have driven excellent returns for SMH stock and its investors. The ETF has been a monster performer over the past decade. As of August 31, 2024, SMH generated an annualized return of 22.5% over the past three years, an incredible annualized return of 34.8% over the past five years, and an enviable 26.6% 10-year annualized return. Those numbers trounce the broader market and even the tech-heavy but more generally allocated Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) over each time horizon.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $296.38 implies about 16% potential upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’m bullish on SMH based on its outstanding long-term performance, its portfolio of high-performing semiconductor stocks, and its bullish analyst outlook.\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL)\n\nNow let’s take a look at the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL), another popular name in the space with $1.4 billion in AUM.\n\nAccording to First Trust, FTXL invests in the Nasdaq U.S. Smart Semiconductor Index and seeks to replicate the holdings and weightings of this index. FTXL uses a modified, factor-weighted index “designed to provide exposure to U.S. companies within the semiconductor industry.” These factors include trailing 12-month return on assets, trailing 12-month gross income, and momentum.\n\nThis factor-weighted approach means that FTXL is a bit more diversified than SMH in that it holds 31 stocks with its top 10 holdings accounting for a lower 60.4% of net asset value. You can check out an overview of FTXL’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ Holdings Tool in the chart below.\n\nAs you can see, FTXL also holds Nvidia, but with an 8.3% weighting as opposed to SMH’s larger weighting of over 20%. Conversely, FTXL has more exposure to Intel; its second-largest holding, with an 8.6% position. Unfortunately, shares of Intel (INTC) are down 30.4% over the past year, which is one reason why FTXL has substantially outperformed SMH in recent times.\n\nOver the past three years, the FTXL ETF has generated a solid annualized return of 11.6% (as of August 31), which is strong but lags far behind SMH’s 22.5% annualized return over the same timespan. Over the past five years, FTXL’s annualized return is better at 23.9% but still lags SMH’s exceptional 34.8% annualized return over that period. FTXL launched in 2016 so it does not yet have a 10-year track record of performance to compare to SMH’s.\n\nIt’s always important to evaluate fees, and FTXL is a bit more expensive to hold than SMH, with an expense ratio of 0.60%. SMH carries an expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nIs FTXL Stock a Buy According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts afford FTXL a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average FTXL stock price target of $111.37 also implies 16% potential upside from current levels, same as SMH.\n\nOverall, FTXL is a good ETF with a solid performance track record, but I am less bullish on it due to the fact that it has significantly lagged SMH’s performance over the past three and five years and also has a higher expense ratio. I land on a neutral rating here.\n\nThe Favored ETF Between SMH and FTXL\n\nIn my opinion, SMH is the clear winner in comparing these 2 popular semiconductor ETFs with different methodologies. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the biggest semiconductor ETF has delivered stellar returns over the past three, five and 10 years, much more than FTXL.\n\nWhile FTXL stock has been a decent performer, it has not been able to keep up with SMH stock. Based on this consistent gulf in results, it seems clear that SMH’s index methodology of favoring the largest semiconductor stocks has allowed it to capture more upside than FTXL’s factor-weighted approach. FTXL stock hasn’t capitalized as much on the strong performance of leading semi stocks like Nvidia and has also had more exposure to laggards like Intel. Of course, should Intel stock rebound, possibly due to a rumored takeover, FTXL’s performance could surge higher.\n\nNonetheless, based on these results, it seems that in the semiconductor space, going with the fastest horses is the better approach. I’m bullish on SMH as the best-in-class semiconductor ETF due to its superior performance, portfolio of strong semiconductor stocks, and its lower expense ratio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of  AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Famous data storage firm NetApp recently announced that it had used NVIDIA AI software and accelerated computing hardware to come up with an advanced generative AI data vision and end-to-end integrated solution. The product, which uses intelligent data infrastructure for enterprise retrieval augmented generation, marketed by NetApp, will bring new capabilities to the NetApp unified storage operating system that can leverage a new NetApp global metadata namespace to unify data stores for the tens of thousands of enterprises that use NetApp for their data infrastructure.\n\nLatest reports published by American magazine Barron’s indicate that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has completed a trading plan adopted earlier in the year. Huang grossed $713 million through stock sales executed by his Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, at an average price of over $118 per share, according to the magazine. The plan was set to be effective through March 2025, but it sold all of the allotted shares six months before expiration, the report claimed. Huang could adopt another plan to sell more shares, it added.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Still a Millionaire-Maker Stock?",
        "content": "The stock market is ideal for slowly building wealth over decades. However, some investors have sped things up by betting on the right companies at the right times.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a great example. If you had bought $5,000 worth of its stock 10 years ago, you would have around $1.25 million today -- a return of 25,000%. Does the legendary chipmaker still have millionaire-maker potential? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nIt's constantly reinventing itself\n\nIn 1993, Nvidia was founded to pioneer a niche computer chip called the graphics processing unit (GPU). These chips excel at processing multiple tasks simultaneously, making them ideal for rendering complex visuals. Most of Nvidia's early growth came from serving the video game industry, where its chips were used in custom PCs and consoles.\n\nHowever, the 2009 launch of Bitcoin (and the subsequent rise of cryptocurrencies) was the company's first big break. At the time, most blockchain networks ran on a system called proof-of-work (PoW), which required participants called miners to solve complex computations to validate transactions and create new coins.\n\nGPUs were perfect for this task. And Nvidia's revenue and profits soared in response to this new market. As mining demand faded after the pandemic, ChatGPT's launch in 2022 kicked off another boom cycle for the company and its quintessential hardware products.\n\nLessons from the past\n\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future results, Nvidia's history demonstrates a distinct boom-and-bust pattern. The chipmaker has produced many millionaires over the long term, but investors who bought shares at the peaks of previous hype cycles faced substantial losses as they waited for the company to discover new opportunities.\n\nUnfortunately, the AI hype cycle is getting long in the tooth. And Wall Street is getting nervous. According to projections from the nonprofit RAND Corporation, more than 80% of AI projects could eventually fail -- double the rate for non-AI-related tech start-ups.\n\nThere are many reasons for the high failure rate, but the most obvious is that AI technology simply isn't easy to monetize. Mainstream large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Gemini are fun to play around with, but they can be unreliable and expensive to run because of the high costs of hardware and energy.\n\nThese platforms also face stiff competition from free, open-source alternatives like Meta Platform's Llama or Elon Musk's Grok. If the consumer-facing software side of the market doesn't start carrying its weight, demand growth for Nvidia's hardware could eventually slow or even reverse.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Nvidia a millionaire maker?\n\nIf Nvidia's business is on the verge of a spectacular crash, there have been no signs of it yet. Second-quarter earnings were another slam dunk, with revenue increasing 122% year over year to $30 billion while operating income jumped 156% to $19.9 billion.\n\nAnd management believes the launch of GPUs based on the new Blackwell architecture will help maintain its spectacular momentum over the coming years.\n\nThe stock's valuation is also extremely attractive. With a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 41, shares are more expensive than the Nasdaq 100 estimate of 29. But this is actually surprisingly cheap for a company growing its top and bottom lines at triple-digit rates.\n\nThe market seems to be discounting Nvidia's shares on fears that the AI industry might not meet expectations. The stock still has millionaire-maker potential, but long-term investors might want to wait for the current hype cycle to fade before betting on the chipmaker's next big break.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Friday, September 27, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), American Express Co. (AXP) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), as well as two micro-cap stocks Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ELTP) and PrimeEnergy Resources Corp. (PNRG). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+150.6% vs. +106.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past year (+80.9% vs. +21.8%). The company’s growth initiatives, like launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, are boosting its revenues. Consumer spending on travel and entertainment, which carries higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well.\r\n\r\nAmerican Express’ solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and prudent deployment of capital via buybacks and dividends.\r\n\r\nHowever, with higher utilization of AXP’s cards, costs in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to go up. Rising marketing costs are straining its margins. Its current debt level amid a high-interest rate environment induces a rise in interest expenses. The stock is overvalued at the moment. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on American Express here >>>)\r\n\r\nWells Fargo’s shares have underperformed the Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-1.4% vs. +6.2%). The company’s loan growth is likely to remain limited, as the asset cap remains in place until it complies fully with regulators’ demands regarding operational risk management.\r\n\r\nThe bank agreed to divest its non-agency third-party servicing segment of the Commercial Mortgage Servicing (CMS) business to Trimont. High mortgage rates and low originations is likely to hurt mortgage banking income in the near term.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, its progress on efficiency initiatives, like branch and footprint reduction, will support cost reduction and drive bottom-line growth. A decent deposit balance is likely to aid its financials, driven by the strength in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment. With a strong capital position and decent liquid profile, the capital distribution seems sustainable.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Elite Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the year-to-date period (+177.9% vs. -0.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $415.56 million has seen first-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues surged 109.4%, driven by the success of its Elite label products.\r\n\r\nThe company’s expanding portfolio includes high-value Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for medications like Methotrexate and controlled substances, positioning it for continued growth. Its recent facility expansion enhances manufacturing capacity, supporting future product launches.\r\n\r\nA robust pipeline and favorable generics market dynamics support long-term prospects. Elite Pharmaceuticals boasts positive cash flows, low debt and a solid cash position.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include customer concentration, pricing pressure from large buyers, intense competition, and regulatory challenges related to controlled substances. Supply chain vulnerabilities and potential overextension in product launches are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Elite Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy Resources’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the year-to-date period (+30.3% vs. -4.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $242.79 million has a strong production growth, evidenced by a 134% increase in oil and a 95% rise in natural gas production in the second quarter of 2024, positions it well for continued revenue and earnings expansion.\r\n\r\nPrimeEnergy Resources’ financial health is supported by nearly doubling revenues and tripling net income in the first half of 2024, along with an expanded $115 million credit facility that enhances liquidity for ongoing drilling. Favorable oil prices and strategic acreage in the Permian Basin offer long-term growth potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include exposure to volatile oil and gas prices, rising production costs, heavy capital expenditures and dependency on a limited number of partners. The shift toward renewable energy and potential regulatory changes pose long-term risks to its traditional oil and gas operations.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PrimeEnergy Resources here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corp. (SONY), Becton, Dickinson and Co. (BDX) and Lennar Corp. (LEN).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "China Urges Local Companies to Stay Away From Nvidia’s Chips",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is stepping up pressure on Chinese companies to buy locally produced artificial intelligence chips instead of Nvidia Corp. products, part of the nation’s effort to expand its semiconductor industry and counter US sanctions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\n\nChinese regulators have been discouraging companies from purchasing Nvidia’s H20 chips, which are used to develop and run AI models, according to people familiar with the matter. The policy has taken the form of guidance rather than an outright ban, as Beijing wants to avoid handicapping its own AI startups and escalating tensions with the US, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nThe move is designed to help domestic Chinese AI chipmakers gain more market share while preparing local tech companies for any potential additional US restrictions, the people said. The country’s leading makers of AI processors include Cambricon Technologies Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. Earlier this year, Beijing also told local electric-vehicle makers to procure more of their supplies from local chipmakers, part of its campaign to reach self-sufficiency in critical technologies.\n\nNvidia shares fell as much as 3.9% to $119.26 on Friday, extending an earlier decline, after Bloomberg reported the news. The stock has more than doubled this year.\n\nThe US government banned Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI processors to Chinese customers in 2022, part of an attempt to limit Beijing’s technological advances. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, modified subsequent versions of the chips so they could be sold under US Commerce Department regulations. The H20 line fits that criteria.\n\nIn recent months, several Chinese regulators, including the powerful Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued so-called window guidance — instructions without the force of law — to reduce the use of Nvidia, the people said. The notice was aimed at encouraging companies to rely on domestic vendors like Huawei and Cambricon, they added. Beijing also amplified the message via a local trade group, according to another.\n\nAt the same time, Chinese officials want local companies to build the best AI systems possible. If that means they need to buy some foreign semiconductors over domestic alternatives, Beijing will still tolerate that, according to people familiar with China’s AI policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia declined to comment. China’s Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Information and Technology, and Cyberspace Administration didn’t respond to faxed requests for comment.\n\nSeparately, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said Friday that he’s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions.\n\n“The first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “And, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us, and we’ll do our best to support them.”\n\nNvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, has seen sales soar as data center operators across the globe scramble to buy more of its processors. China continues to be part of that growth, though trade restrictions have taken a toll. In the July quarter, it got 12% of its revenue, or about $3.7 billion, from the country, including Hong Kong. That was up more than 30% from a year earlier.\n\n“Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during an earnings call in August. “As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward.”\n\nNvidia chips are the gold standard for companies looking to develop artificial intelligence services. The likes of Meta Platforms Inc., OpenAI and Alphabet Inc. have been racing to scoop up its most cutting-edge products so they can build leading AI models. Several Chinese tech companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., stockpiled Nvidia’s chips before the export controls took effect.\n\nChinese chip designers and manufacturers, meanwhile, are working to introduce alternatives to Nvidia. Beijing has offered billions in subsidies to the semiconductor sector, but local AI chips remain well behind Nvidia’s fare.\n\nChina does have a burgeoning AI sector, though, despite the US restrictions. ByteDance and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. have been investing aggressively, while a flock of startups are vying for leadership. There are six so-called tigers in developing large language models, the key technology behind generative AI: 01.AI, Baichuan, Moonshot, MiniMax, Stepfun and Zhipu.\n\nSome of the companies are turning a blind eye to the Chinese decree to avoid H20 chips and rushing to buy more of them before an anticipated sanction from the US by the end of this year, one of the people said, though they are also buying homemade Huawei chips to please Beijing.\n\n--With assistance from John Liu, Jessica Sui, Zheng Wu, Ian King and Tyler Kendall.\n\n(Updates with Nvidia shares in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft The End of the Cheap Burger Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought Apple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters How Harris’ Campaign Finally Made Biden’s Meme Strategy Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang, who helped create the technology at the heart of the explosion in artificial intelligence computing, said nuclear power is a good option for the renewable energy needed for the growing number of data centers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Why Turning Churches Into Housing Is So Hard\n\n“Nuclear is wonderful as one of the sources of energy, one of the sources of sustainable energy,” Huang said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “It won’t be the only one. We’re going to need energy from all sources and balance the availability and the cost of energy as well as the sustainability over time.”\n\nIn some parts of the world, electricity generation is already insufficient to support the building of new data centers. That’s an increasing problem as the world’s largest companies pour hundreds of billions of dollars into new infrastructure that they believe is the future of computing.\n\nIt’s a squeeze that’s leading to trade-offs being made on the location of the new “AI factories,” as Huang refers to them. Some data centers can’t be filled to full capacity, and others are being built well away from population centers.\n\nNvidia’s leader has argued that his company’s products, while more power hungry than their predecessors — the latest generation chip requires over a kilowatt — are more efficient because they can do the work of training and running AI software more quickly and replace multiple older components.\n\nSeparately, Huang said he’s doing his best to serve customers in China and stay within the requirements of US government restrictions on Nvidia’s exports to that country.\n\n“The first thing we have to do is comply with whatever policies and regulations that are being imposed,” he said. “And, meanwhile, do the best we can to compete in the markets that we serve. We have a lot of customers there that depend on us and we’ll do our best to support them.”\n\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Ian King.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft The End of the Cheap Burger Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought Apple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters How Harris’ Campaign Finally Made Biden’s Meme Strategy Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mizuho analysts shifted their favorite semiconductor stock from TSMC to ASML (AS:ASML), citing a compelling risk-reward opportunity as the stock has underperformed its peers.\n\nIn a note, Mizuho highlighted that while TSMC shares have risen 16% in September, ASML has lagged significantly, up just 0.8% during the same period.\n\nThe analysts now see ASML as their top pick for year-end gains, presenting it as an attractive long-term investment.\n\n\"ASML is my new favorite single semi long into year-end,\" a Mizuho analyst wrote, pointing to the stock's underperformance relative to both the broader semiconductor sector and major players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and TSMC. The analyst sees a \"compelling risk-reward with limited downside\" for the stock.\n\nThey highlighted that market sentiment around ASML has been weighed down by concerns over Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s capital expenditure cuts and risks related to China restrictions.\n\nHowever, Mizuho believes this presents a buying opportunity, given the negative sentiment already factored into the stock's price.\n\nLooking ahead, Mizuho expects ASML's third-quarter results in October to be stable and views the company's upcoming investor day on November 14 as a key event.\n\nThey noted that ASML management is not expected to lower its long-term revenue targets for 2025, which are currently estimated between €30-40 billion. According to Mizuho,\n\n\"I sense buyside now expects €32-33 billion at best,\" added the Mizuho analyst, suggesting that even modest reductions in estimates could clear the way for a rally.\n\nThe analysts also see ASML as well-positioned for a rebound in lithography tool spending, forecasting that the company's valuation could expand back to a 30-32 forward P/E range.\n\nWith EPS estimates for 2024 already coming down, Mizuho sees limited downside and significant potential for upside.\n\n\"ASML valuation can expand back more towards 30-32 forward P/E range vs the compressed level of 26-27 right now,\" Mizuho added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMizuho bullish on this underperforming chip stock\n\nSpain stocks higher at close of trade; IBEX 35 up 0.12%\n\nPortugal stocks higher at close of trade; PSI up 0.54%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Up 5.5% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia (NVDA). Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Q2 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Estimates\n\nNVIDIA reported better-than-expected results for second-quarter fiscal 2025. The chip maker reported non-GAAP earnings of 68 cents per share for the aforementioned quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.3%. The reported figure soared 152% year over year while increasing 11% sequentially. Higher revenues, as well as improvement in gross margin and operating margin, drove the robust increase in earnings.\n\nFiscal second-quarter revenues climbed 122% and increased 15% sequentially to $30.04 billion. The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and higher sales across the Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive end markets. The top line also beat the consensus mark of $28.42 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Segment Details\n\nNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments — Graphics and Compute & Networking.\n\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing as well as automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\n\nGraphics accounted for 12% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment’s top line soared 16% year over year while increasing 7% sequentially to $3.59 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimates for the Graphics segment was pegged at $3.81 billion.\n\nCompute & Networking represented 88% of fiscal second-quarter revenues. The segment comprises the Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics as well as other embedded platforms.\n\nCompute & Networking revenues soared 154% year over year and 17% sequentially to $26.45 billion. Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue estimate for this segment was pegged at $24.33 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Market Platform Top-Line Details\n\nBased on the market platform, revenues from Data Center (87.4% of revenues) jumped 154% year over year and 16% from the previous quarter to $26.27 billion. This robust rise was mainly driven by higher shipments of the Hopper GPU computing platform that is used for the training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Our estimate for this end-market’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $24.51 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA witnessed strong demand for its chips used in the Data Center by all customers in both compute and networking markets. During the fiscal second quarter, large cloud providers represented 45% of Data Center revenues while the remaining stemmed from consumer internet and enterprise companies.\n\nGaming revenues increased 16% year over year and 9% sequentially at $2.88 billion, accounting for 9.6% of the total revenues. The year-over-year surge reflects increased sales of its GeForce RTX 40 series family of GPUs (graphics processing units) and game console system-on-chips. Our estimate for the Gaming end-market’s second-quarter revenues was pegged at $2.77 billion.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenues (1.5% of revenues) increased 20% year over year and 6% sequentially to $454 million. The increase was primarily driven by the ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on the Ada architecture. Our estimate for the Professional Visualization end-market’s fiscal second-quarter revenues was pegged at $475.7 million.\n\nAutomotive sales (1.2% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $346 million, up 37% on a year-over-year basis and 5% sequentially. The increase was mainly driven by AI cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.  OEM and Other revenues (0.3% of revenues) were up 33% year over year and 13% sequentially to $88 million. Our estimate for the Automotive and OEM end markets’ fiscal second-quarter revenues were pegged at $294.6 million and $86.4 million, respectively.\n\nNVDA Operating Details\n\nNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 75.7% from 71.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher Data Center sales and benefits from favorable component costs. However, non-GAAP gross margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within the Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses increased 52% year over year and 12% sequentially to $2.21 billion. The increase was due to higher compensations and related benefits. However, as a percentage of total revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined to 9.3% from 13.6% in the year-ago quarter and 9.6% in the previous quarter.\n\nThe non-GAAP operating income jumped 156% year over year and 10% sequentially to $19.94 billion, driven by higher revenues. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 880 bps to 66.4% from the year-ago quarter’s 57.6% due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Sequentially, non-GAAP operating income contracted 290 bps due to a reduction in gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.\n\nNVIDIA’s non-GAAP net income margin of 56.4% for the second quarter improved 650 bps year over year but contracted 210 bps sequentially. This was the first time the company witnessed a sequential contraction in net income margin following eight quarters of improvement.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nAs of July 28, 2024, NVDA’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34.8 billion, up from $31.44 billion as of April 28. As of July 28, the total long-term debt was $8.46 billion, unchanged sequentially.\n\nNVIDIA generated $14.5 billion in operating cash flow, up from the year-ago quarter’s $6.3 billion but down from the previous quarter’s $15.3 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, it generated an operating cash flow of $29.8 billion. NVIDIA generated a free cash flow of $13.48 billion in the second quarter and $28.42 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025.\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter, the company returned $246 million to shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $7.16 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2025, the company paid out $344 million in dividends and bought back stocks worth $14.9 billion.\n\nAt the end of the second quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of approximately $7.5 billion. The board of directors recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing the total authorization to $57.5 billion, which has no expiration time.\n\nNVDA Third-Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $32.5 billion (+/-2%). The non-GAAP gross margin is projected at 75% (+/-50 bps). Non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $3 billion.\n\nNVIDIA’s Blackwell Update\n\nDuring its second-quarter earnings conference call, NVIDIA revealed that it has executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield and has shipped the same in the second quarter. It is expected to start ramping up the production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and continue through fiscal 2026.\n\nEarlier, NVIDIA stated that the ramp-up of Blackwell production will begin in 2024. However, the latest update signals that the production ramp-up could now start by the end of January 2025.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 7.26% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Nvidia has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Nvidia has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Unique Investment Angles for Artificial Intelligence (AI): NVDA, VRT, PLTR",
        "content": "We’ve all become accustomed to the artificial intelligence (AI) theme, with many investors clamoring for exposure. And the results we’ve received from several companies have helped confirm the positivity surrounding the theme, further exciting investors.\n\nThankfully, there are several angles investors can use to obtain exposure, such as Nvidia NVDA for the hardware side, Vertiv VRT for data center services, and Palantir PLTR for the software angle.  Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nNVDA Remains Clear AI Favorite\n\nNvidia shares have finally taken a breather over the last three months, essentially flat compared to the S&P 500’s 4% gain. Shares didn’t see a melt-up following its latest release like previously, though results were again remarkable.\n\nThe company maintains a notably bright outlook across the board, undoubtedly constructive for share performance moving forward despite the recent sideways action.

Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning its latest quarterly release, the AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting an impressive 122% year-over-year climb. As usual, Data Center results reflected the main event, with a quarterly sales record of $26.3 billion up 150% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nAnd despite its strong run, the valuation picture here remains attractive, with the current 36.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple comparing favorably to the 50.7X five-year median. The current PEG works out to 0.8X, reflective of both growth and value.

        "title": "NetApp Unveils Advanced Gen-AI Data Vision With NVIDIA Integration",
        "content": "NetApp, Inc. NTAP recently announced an advancement in generative artificial intelligence (AI), combining its data management expertise with NVIDIA’s NVDA AI software and accelerated computing. The partnership is aimed at boosting enterprise retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which will unlock the power of next-gen agentic AI. Agentic AI systems can autonomously process vast amounts of data and perform actions based on that knowledge. Through the integration of NTAP’s ONTAP unified storage operating system with NVIDIA’s advanced AI software, the joined forces aim to empower enterprises to harness the full potential of their data for generative AI applications. \r\n\r\nNetApp’s ONTAP unified storage operating system is already trusted by tens of thousands of enterprises to manage and store their critical data. The recent enhancements introduce a global metadata namespace that can unify data across multiple storage environments, whether on-premises or in the cloud. This creates an unprecedented level of access to enterprise data, unlocking exabytes of information for AI to process. \r\n\r\nBy applying RAG to their AI initiatives, organizations can build agentic AI systems capable of autonomously retrieving data from various sources, analyzing it and using it to perform complex tasks, ranging from customer service operations to financial businesses.\n\nKey Components of NTAP’s Cutting-Edge AI Solution\n\nThe foundation of NetApp’s solution lies in the combination of several cutting-edge technologies and platforms. The integration of NVIDIA NeMo Retriever and NIM microservices from the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform empowers enterprises to not only access their data but also “vectorize” and process it for AI deployments.\r\n\r\nCertified for NVIDIA DGX BasePOD infrastructure and NVIDIA OVX solutions and operated through BlueXP, NetApp AIPod offers an end-to-end infrastructure that aids users with their browsing while maintaining the highest levels of security and compliance. Through NetApp BlueXP, users can easily manage their AI data pipeline. \r\n\r\nOnce the data is collected and processed, NVIDIA NeMo can leverage it for generative AI deployments, making it possible for AI applications to autonomously complete tasks, from customer support to complex business decisions. The addition of privacy guardrails ensures that sensitive data is protected throughout the AI lifecycle, providing enterprises with peace of mind as they boost their AI efforts.\r\n\r\nNetApp has already initiated the certification process for its ONTAP storage solutions on NVIDIA’s DGX SuperPOD platform, demonstrating its commitment to delivering scalable, high-performance AI infrastructure. Enterprises eager to adopt these new capabilities will have the opportunity to experience them at NetApp INSIGHT, with a technology preview expected later in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nNTAP Gains From Tie-Ups & Momentum in All-flash Arrays\n\nNetApp’s efforts to drive efficiency and foster innovation are evident from the growing partnership deals. Recently, it deepened its collaboration with Amazon Web Services to improve customer experiences through accelerated generative AI initiatives, simplified processes, and valuable CloudOps solutions. The expanded alliance is likely to facilitate seamless workload migrations and new application deployments on AWS. \r\n\r\nThe company is gaining from continued demand for its portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, especially the C-series capacity flash and ASA block-optimized flash. It is expecting the newly launched AFF A-series, along with its C-series and ASA products, to capture a significant chunk of the all-flash market. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s All-Flash Array Business’ annualized net revenue run rate was $3.4 billion, up 21% year over year. Total billings rose 12% to $1.45 billion.\n\nNTAP’S Zacks Rank & Stock Price Performance\n\nCurrently, NTAP sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of the company have gained 63.2% in the past year compared with the sub-industry's growth of 47.2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are Harmonic Inc. HLIT, and Ubiquiti Inc. UI. HLIT and UI presently sport a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHarmonic enables media companies and service providers to deliver ultra-high-quality broadcast and OTT video services to consumers globally. HLIT delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 32.5%.\r\n\r\nUbiquiti company offers a comprehensive portfolio of networking products and solutions for service providers and enterprises. The company’s effective management of its strong global network of more than 100 distributors and master resellers improved its visibility for future demand and inventory management techniques.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Microsoft, Google, Meta Pave Path to AI Expansion, Nvidia and Broadcom Set to Reap Benefits\n\nThe quarterly performance of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) adequately reflects that the artificial intelligence wave is in no mood to slow down in the near term.\n\nHyperscalers, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) remain aggressively invested in their artificial intelligence ambitions. The U.S. and China’s key rate cuts also added an additional tailwind for the capital-intensive industry.\n\nMicrosoft committed 14.7 billion Reais ($2.70 billion) over three years to Brazil’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to a Reuters report.\n\nAlso Read: Micron’s AI-Driven HBM Demand and Data Center Growth to Fuel Stock Upside, Analysts Say\n\nThe company’s ConectAI program will train 5 million people with AI skills over the next three years. Microsoft already has two Azure regions: one in São Paulo state, which it launched in 2014, and another in Rio de Janeiro, which it launched in 2020.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft earmarked $1.3 billion over the next three years to drive Mexico’s AI infrastructure and initiatives, including training 5 million people. Microsoft also collaborated with BlackRock, Inc (NYSE:BLK) and other partners, forging a fresh $30 billion investment fund to tap the AI wave.\n\nGoogle is eyeing a $3.3 billion investment in South Carolina to build two new data centers. The search engine giant’s plans included two new data center campuses in Dorchester County and expanding its existing data center campus in Berkeley County, Reuters cites the South Carolina governor’s office as saying.\n\nAlphabet committed $2 billion to the Dorchester County facilities, potentially creating 200 new operational jobs. According to Reuters, the company also earmarked $1.3 billion for Berkeley County.\n\nAnother positive update for the industry is the report indicating struggling chipmaker Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and the U.S. government are trying to finalize the $8.5 billion in direct funding for the chipmaker before the end of the year.\n\nTherefore, Intel’s exploration of stake sales to companies like Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) could also disrupt its chances of bagging the subsidy over antitrust grounds. Intel had already faced Senator scrutiny over its cost-cutting measures as the subsidy aims to create additional U.S. jobs.\n\nSemiconductor ETFs VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) gained 5%-6% in the last 5 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock is up 1.21% to $24.21 premarket at last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMeta Analysts Highlight AI, VR Advances, See Growth Pushing It Toward Apple-Like Valuation\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nAdvances in AI could trigger unwelcome outcomes for investors in the future.\n\nAs AI advances speed up markets and also create more complex trading models, a lot of stocks may become overcrowded in the search for alpha — and at risk for swift downdrafts if information changes, warns Tradeweb Markets (TW) CEO Billy Hult.\n\n\"It's something [we have] to think through,\" Hult told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nCrowded trades occur when similar investment strategies — usually fueled by complex trading models —send investors all into the same stocks. Shares of the overcrowded stocks tend to rise as the bulls rush in with reckless abandon, and little attention is paid to a company's valuation.\n\nLiquidity shortages, spikes in volatility, and short squeezes are some risks that come with crowded trades.\n\nThe other risk is that the stocks could get hammered significantly if information changes, sending everyone headed for the exit all at once.\n\nThe latest example: the swift sell-off in markets in early August.\n\nBank of America strategists said in a report at the time that “crowding risk mattered,” and it saw “the least crowded stocks outperforming the most crowded by eight percentage points.”\n\nThe Magnificent 7 tech stocks rose again in popularity this summer, as AI chips powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) enjoyed a brief stay as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nPros like Hult argue this type of crowding into top-performing stocks will only worsen as AI makes markets more sophisticated.\n\nProponents of AI envision, however, a world where traders are better informed through deeper insight gathered from a variety of sources.\n\n“I think we’re going to continue to see data driven execution in fixed income trading. And we're going to continue to see machine learning get applied to, sort of how the search for liquidity occurs in fixed income,” said Hult. “The next level of technology is going to be more sophisticated.”\n\nHult is a longtime evangelist of integrating finance, investment vehicles, and revolutionary technology. As a builder of electronic marketplaces, Tradeweb has worked with firms that seek to unite investors and machines. But it also stays true to the need for softer people skills.\n\n“[Tradeweb] has lived and breathed in the ethos of the market for a long time,” Hult said. “We really value the personal relationship side of the business.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "AI Mania in Fine Fettle: ETFs to Invest",
        "content": "After a brief lull, the fervor for artificial intelligence (AI) investments is back with a bang on Wall Street. This revival has been buoyed by upbeat quarterly performance of Chip biggie Micron MU and a host of news released lately.\n\nThis puts focus on AI ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF ROBT and Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF WISE.\n\nInside Micron Stock’s Performance\n\nMicron stock jumped 16% before the bell on Thursday after the chipmaker forecast higher-than-expected revenue for the upcoming quarter. Management attributed the raised guidance to a more favorable pricing environment as well as robust demand for Micron's memory chips used in data centers to power artificial intelligence. Per management, the company is entering fiscal year 2025 with \"the best competitive positioning in Micron's history.\"\n\nMicrosoft to Invest $1.3 Billion in Mexico for AI and Cloud Expansion\n\nTech giant Microsoft announced a $1.3 billion investment over the next three years to enhance its cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in Mexico. The investment will focus on improving connectivity and fostering AI adoption among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).\n\nMicrosoft’s initiative looks to reach 5 million people and support 30,000 SMBs within three years. Mexican companies such as breadmaker Bimbo and cement producer Cemex are already utilizing Microsoft’s AI tools to enhance their operations.\n\nAmazon's AI Strategy Poised to Deliver a Competitive Chip Advantage\n\nAmazon’s cloud division, AWS, has made huge investments to close the gap with the industry's first mover, Microsoft, and may now be in a favorable position. A key advantage for Amazon is its ability to use its own chips in its data centers, reducing costs compared to relying on NVIDIA's NVDA technology. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\n\nSome analysts argue that Amazon holds an advantage over its competitors like Microsoft, which recently received a rare downgrade for over-relying on NVIDIA's AI infrastructure. As Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, explained to Yahoo Finance, “Microsoft is so dependent on Nvidia that it’s essentially transferring wealth from its shareholders to Nvidia’s.”\n\nNVIDIA Valuation Approaches $3 Trillion Again\n\nNVIDIA’s chief executive Jensen Huang finished selling millions of shares in the company, worth more than $700 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday, boosting the NVIDIA stock’s valuation. NVIDIA briefly became the world’s most valuable company in June after jumping to a market cap of $3.33 trillion, topping Apple and Microsoft thanks to the rising demand for artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia lost about $280 billion in market value after shares declined 8% amid a larger tech selloff, though the company later rallied due to the Fed rate cut and hopes for more monetary easing in the coming days.\n\nAI ETFs in Focus\n\nWith AI technology rapidly advancing and becoming increasingly integral to various industries, investors must be looking for ways to capitalize on this trend.

        "title": "JD.com and Civitas Resources have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 27, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares JD.com, Inc. JD as the Bull of the Day and Civitas Resources, Inc. CIVI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Bank of America Corp.'s BAC and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nJD.com, Inc., the Chinese online retail and supply chain giant, is dirt cheap. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has plunged to 5-year lows but earnings are expected to rise by the double digits this year.\n\nJD.com is a Chinese supply chain-based technology and service provider. It seeks to enable consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it.\n\n$5 Billion Share Repurchase Plan Announced\n\nHow cheap are JD.com shares? So cheap that on Aug 27, 2024, JD.com announced a new share repurchase program effective as of Sep 2024.\n\nThe company can repurchase up to $5 billion in shares over the next 36 months, or through the end of Aug 2027.\n\nAnother Earnings Beat for JD.com in the Second Quarter\n\nOn Aug 15, 2024, JD.com reported its second quarter earnings results and beat on the Zacks Consensus by $0.43. Earnings were $1.29 versus the consensus of $0.86.\n\nIt has an impressive earnings surprise track record, having beaten every quarter for 5 years. That includes the difficult quarters during the pandemic when global economies were shut.\n\nRevenues were up just 1.2% to $40.1 billion year-over-year, however, as electronics and home appliances cooled from a year ago but the general merchandise category, especially supermarket, remained strong.\n\nGross margin rose 137 bps to 15.8%.\n\nAnalysts Still Bullish on JD.com\n\nInvestors may be bearish on the company, but the analysts are not.\n\n2 earnings estimates were revised higher for 2024 in the last 60 days which pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate up to $3.97 from $3.40. JD.com made just $3.12 in 2023, so that is earnings growth of 27.2%.\n\nSimilarly, 2 estimates were also revised higher for 2025 in the last 2 months. The Zacks Consensus jumped to $4.15 from $3.64, which is further earnings growth of 4.5%.\n\nJD.com is Dirt Cheap\n\nShares of JD.com have been falling the past few years and hit a 5-year low earlier in 2024. They have since spiked higher after the Chinese central bank, the PBOC, cut interest rates and injected more liquidity into both the stock market and the economy to provide a boost to the sluggish economy.\n\nShares are still underperforming the S&P 500 over the last 5-years.\n\nThe stock remains dirt cheap, even with the recent spike in the shares. It has all the hallmarks of a classic value stock including a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio under 10 at just 8.4.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has a PEG ratio of just 0.5. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company has both growth and value.\n\nJD.com also has a cheap price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.3. A P/S ratio under 1.0 means an investor is buying the sales at a discount. In this case, a JD.com shareholder is getting $1.00 of sales for just $0.30.\n\nIn addition to the share repurchase program, JD.com also pays a dividend, yielding 2.2%.\n\nFor investors looking to invest in the hoped-for Chinese economic rebound in 2025, e-commerce industry leader, JD.com, should be on your short list.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCivitas Resources, Inc. is facing falling WTI crude prices heading into 2025. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) may struggle to grow earnings if crude prices continue to decline.\n\nCivitas Resources is an independent oil and natural gas producer in the Denver-Julesburg and Permian basins in the United States. It has a market cap of $4.86 billion.\n\nAnother Miss for Civitas in the Second Quarter of 2024\n\nOn Aug 1, 2024, Civitas Resources reported its second quarter 2024 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus for the second quarter in a row. Earnings were $2.06 versus the consensus of $2.93.\n\nCivitas is an \"oily\" producer, meaning it focuses on oil and not natural gas. Crude oil accounted for 87% of total revenue in the quarter.\n\nSales of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (\"NGL\") were $1.3 billion which was consistent with that of the first quarter.\n\nPermian Basin sales volumes rose about 12% from the first quarter, driven by strong production from recent Delaware and Midland Basin wells.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $235.4 million.\n\nCivitas is Shareholder Focused with a Buyback and Dividend Plan\n\nThe company is shareholder focused. It returned capital to shareholders in the quarter of $274 million including dividends of $1.50 per share and share repurchases of $125 million. It pays a strong base dividend and a variable dividend of at least 50% of its free cash flow.\n\nBeginning in the third quarter, the variable return of capital will be allocated through a combination of common stock repurchases and dividends, with the quarterly allocation between the two determined by management and the Board.\n\nThe quarterly base dividend remains at $0.50 per share. That's currently a yield of 3.9%.\n\nEarnings Estimates Get Cut\n\nWith WTI crude back trading under $70, it's not surprising that the analysts have been cutting their earnings estimates on Civitas.\n\nFor 2024, 1 estimate was cut in the last 30 days but 4 were cut prior to that, in the last 60 days. The full year earnings estimate has fallen to $10.05 from $12.13.\n\nHowever, it is still earnings growth of 11.4% over last year, when Civitas made $9.02.\n\nEstimates have also been cut for 2025 in the last 60 days. 6 earnings estimates were cut during that time, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $10.69 from $13.06 just 60 days prior. That's still earnings growth of 6.4%.\n\nHowever, it doesn't look good on the chart. If WTI crude prices fall further, look for earnings to continue to fall.\n\nIs Civitas a Value Trap?\n\nShares of Civitas have fallen sharply over the last year but earnings are still expected to grow this year and next (for now).\n\nCivitas now has a forward P/E of just 5.1. But a price-to-earnings ratio that is extremely low can indicate that a stock is a value trap.\n\nWith the Saudis signaling they are going to increase production starting in Dec 2024, there is a lot of uncertainty about crude prices.\n\nInvestors might want to stay on the sidelines and wait for clarification on crude prices before diving into an oil and natural gas producer like Civitas.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nNVIDIA Stock Post 3-Month Split: Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nNVIDIA Corp. was the top performer on the S&P 500 in 2023 and continued its upward movement this year due to its sheer dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA stock breezed past $1,000 in early 2024, making it inaccessible for many investors. So, a stock split was initiated in early June. Let's examine NVIDIA's performance following the split to determine its present investment potential.\n\nNVIDIA Stock Performance – Positive After Stock Split\n\nIn May, NVIDIA declared its intention to split its stock in a 10-for-1 ratio. Immediately after the announcement, the stock climbed from around $900 to more than $1,000. Between the announcement and the split date (Friday, June 7), NVIDIA stock soared about 30%. Post-split, it opened on June 10 at about $120, now trading at around $123, marking a more than 2% increase.\n\nNVIDIA stock, historically, has gained two out of three times in the three months following a stock split. A Statista report using Bank of America Corp.'s data found that companies that split their stocks had an average return of more than 25% in the 12 months post-split, double the S&P 500's average return in the same period.\n\nFed Rate Cuts Boost NVIDIA Stock\n\nAfter the split, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. The Fed trimmed interest rates by 50 basis points to support economic growth. The Fed eased its monetary policy for the first time in four years.\n\nLower interest rates are expected to reduce NVIDIA's borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Lower interest rates also don't affect NVIDIA's cash flows necessary for growth initiatives.\n\nGoing back to the 1990s, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 20.7% in the 12 months following an interest rate cut, while the S&P 500 jumped only 2.9%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nKey Tailwinds for NVIDIA Stock\n\nDominance in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market, shipment of the most sought-after Blackwell chips by year-end and significant growth in the AI market also boosted NVIDIA stock.\n\nThe widespread use of NVIDIA's CUDA software platform over Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s ROCm software platform has given it the bulk share in the GPU market, which is projected to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, assured that the high-end Blackwell chips will be available soon to cater to high demand. This is because the Blackwell chips have more AI throughput than the current Hopper chips.\n\nA recent report by Bain Technology showed that the AI hardware and software market is estimated to grow to $990 billion by 2027 from around $185 billion in the current year, crushing any concerns that the big cloud companies are contemplating spending big on AI.\n\nNVIDIA benefits from the AI boom as a key hardware and technology provider for AI applications. It expects revenues of $10 billion for 2024 from the government's sovereign AI investments, a significant increase from zero last year, per the Bain Technology report.\n\nStrong Fundamentals to Drive NVIDIA Stock\n\nNVIDIA's ability to generate profits proficiently and manage costs efficiently is likely to drive up its future share price based on its return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin.\n\nNVIDIA's ROE is 120%, surpassing the Semiconductor - General industry's 73.2%. Any reading above 100% indicates the company's net income is exceeding its equity.\n\nNVIDIA's net profit margin is 55%, more than the industry's 47.6%. Any reading above the 20% threshold indicates a high margin (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other S&P 500 Stocks Show Strong Earnings Growth).\n\nHere's How to Trade NVIDIA Stock\n\nNVIDIA's shares rose post-split due to macro trends and continue to be a Wall Street darling based on strong fundamentals.\n\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 23.7% from the stock's last closing price of $120.87, while the highest price target is $200, a massive upside of 65.5%.\n\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the 200-DMA, indicating a near-term bullish trend.\n\nNVIDIA stakeholders, therefore, should retain their market share due to the strong price upside, making selling unlikely. However, NVIDIA stock's meteoric rise in the past few years due to the advent of AI has made the stock expensive.\n\nNew buyers, thus, should wait for an opportune moment to invest in NVIDIA. After all, per the price/earnings, the stock is trading at 43.8X, above the peer group's 18.2X forward earnings multiple.\n\nFor now, NVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks May Be Better Buys Than Nvidia for the Blackwell Launch",
        "content": "Chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) are an integral component in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. At the moment, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) holds an estimated 88% of the AI GPU market thanks to its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs.\n\nIn the coming months, Nvidia is set to add another GPU -- called Blackwell --to its roster. During the company's most recent earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said \"demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply\" and that the new chipsets were forecast to generate billions in revenue by the fourth quarter.\n\nWhile Blackwell appears to be a short-term tailwind for Nvidia, I see two other stocks as potentially better opportunities in the long run.\n\nHere's why I think Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) could be more savvy buys for the upcoming Blackwell launch.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro is an IT infrastructure company that specializes in storage cluster and server rack designs for GPUs. Soaring demand for GPUs over the last couple of years has been a major catalyst for Supermicro's business.\n\nWhile the Blackwell GPUs should ignite new opportunities among IT architecture specialists, I'm anticipating that Supermicro will be a particular beneficiary given the company's strong relationship with Nvidia. With that said, there are some important things to note about Supermicro's business right now.\n\nFirst, the company's latest earnings report from early August was a mixed bag. While revenue continues to grow at an impressive rate, the company's gross margin is a glaring issue.\n\nIn general, Supermicro's business is going to carry lower margins compared to a software business or a company that has outsize pricing power, such as Nvidia. The reason for this is that designing storage clusters requires hefty capital expenditures (capex), which can take a toll on profit margins. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn addition to the financial results, Hindenburg Research recently published a short report alleging that Supermicro's financial controls and accounting practices are weak. It is important for investors to understand that short-sellers such as Hindenburg benefit when a stock price goes down -- as is the case with Supermicro right now -- but this is not the first time Supermicro has been at the center of accounting-related accusations. In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Super Micro Computer and its CFO for violating federal securities laws by \"engaging in improper accounting -- prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses from at least fiscal year ... 2015 through FY 2017.\"\n\nFurthermore, the company is set to execute a 10-for-1 stock split in the next week; such an event will almost certainly trigger some momentum-driven trading activity.\n\nLastly, on Sept. 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that unnamed sources told it the Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing Supermicro and seeking information apparently tied to allegations of accounting violations.\n\nHowever, at this time details are sparse. I would let this situation play out before fleeing and writing Supermicro off.\n\nOn top of all of this, investor uncertainty surrounding macro factors such as interest rate tapering from the Federal Reserve have also influenced selling activity in the market over the last several weeks.\n\nSupermicro stock has been experiencing quite the precipitous sell-off as of late, and much of this revolves around a mixture of hearsay, panic selling, and the macroeconomy.\n\nRight now, Supermicro's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is just 14 -- nearly 72% off its highs from earlier this year. Moreover, this pales in comparison to the S&P 500's forward P/E of 23.\n\nThis discount to prior valuation levels could make Supermicro stock a compelling opportunity as the Blackwell launch sits on the horizon. SMCI PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Dell Technologies\n\nEarlier in the summer, Elon Musk's AI start-up, xAI, tapped Dell and Supermicro for server rack designs for its GPU clusters. Although this deal came with high-profile headlines, Dell's entire infrastructure solutions group (ISG) is a winning operation.\n\nDuring its second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 2), Dell had $3.2 billion in AI-optimized server orders and ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in backlog.\n\nFrom a revenue perspective, ISG increased 38% year over year to a record $11.6 billion. Within ISG, sales from servers and networking equipment rose 80% year over year to $7.7 billion. Meanwhile, storage revenue of $4 billion actually dropped nominally year over year by 5%.\n\nI see the Blackwell launch as an additional catalyst for Dell's ISG segment across both servers and networking as well as storage solutions. To me, Blackwell should help spur even more demand for Dell's infrastructure solutions. I suspect investors could begin to get a glimpse of Blackwell's impact on Dell by looking at backlog details in upcoming earnings reports. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nI think buying Supermicro stock right now comes with some risk, considering its shares will likely continue experiencing outsize volatility leading up to the split on Oct. 1 and as details of any government probe emerge. In the long run, however, I think the Blackwell GPUs will be a catalyst for Supermicro's services and newfound demand could ignite a rebound in the stock.\n\nWhile Dell's forward P/E of 14.9 is in line with that of Supermicro, I see the company as the more prudent investment right now since there is less hoopla surrounding the company compared to its peer.\n\nNevertheless, I see both Supermicro and Dell as beneficiaries of the Blackwell launch and think the growth spurred from these new GPUs will last quite a long time. For these reasons, investors may want to consider positions in each as Nvidia's newest chipset release looms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Intel (INTC)\n\nChipmaker Intel rejected an approach by UK semiconductor firm Arm Holdings (ARM) to buy its product division, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nIntel is separating its chip product division and manufacturing operations, as part of restructuring efforts, following a challenge period for the business. In addition to missing estimates on its second-quarter earnings, the company announced last month that it planned to layoff 15,000 employees.\n\nThe company's struggles have led to increasing takeover speculation, with reports at the end of last week that rival Qualcomm (QCOM) had approached Intel about a deal. Meanwhile, Apollo Global Management – which owns Yahoo – has reportedly shown interest in making a multibillion-dollar investment in the chipmaker.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets rise as China stocks post best week since 2008\n\nSeparately, the Financial Times reported that the Intel and the US government were on course to finalise $8.5bn in funding for the company before the end of the year.\n\nIn busy week of news surrounding the company, it also unveiled two new artificial intelligence (AI) chips, as it seeks to improve its data centre business and and compete with rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nIntel shares were 1% lower in pre-market trading and are down 52% year-to-date.\n\nBlackBerry (BB)\n\nShares in Blackberry climbed 6% in Thursday session but then dipped 2% in after-hours trading, on the back of the company releasing its second-quarter earnings.\n\nBlackberry, which now focuses on cybersecurity, said it broke even in the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, reporting that it pared back losses by $23m (£17m).\n\nThe Canadian company, originally known for its iconic smartphone, posted revenues of $145m for the three months to 31 August, up from $132m in same period last year.\n\nJohn J Giamatteo, CEO of BlackBerry, said the company had \"reached a significant milestone on our path to profitability\".\n\n\"This result was achieved through a combination of stronger than expected, double-digit revenue growth for both IoT (internet of things) and cybersecurity, as well as tremendous ongoing progress in rationalizing our cost structure,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, BlackBerry said it expected to breakeven once again and guided to revenues of between $146m and $154m.\n\nAlibaba (BABA)\n\nUS-listed shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba continued to rally on Thursday, ending the session 10% higher, after China's central bank unveiled a raft of stimulus measures to shore up the country's economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe news lifted other US-listed Chinese companies, with JD.com (JD) and PDD Holdings (PDD) both gaining around 14% on Thursday.\n\nThe People's Bank of China cut the amount banks must hold in reserve, releasing an estimated $142.6bn in liquidity into the financial market.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nThis saw Chinese markets enjoyed their best week this week since 2008, with the nation's benchmark index, the CSI 300 (000300.SS) ending Friday's session 4.5% higher.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “There will of course be a time lag between the announcement of the stimulus package and its effects washing through to the economy, but the very fact that the authorities have moved away from their previous inertia has energised both domestic and international markets alike.”\n\nMicron Technology (MU)\n\nAnother chipmaker in focus is Micron, with its shares having soared 15% on Thursday, after it forecast higher-than-expected revenue for the upcoming quarter.\n\nMicron said it expected first-quarter revenues of $8.7bn, higher than the $8.3bn anticipated by analysts.\n\nThe company said it was seeing a more favourable pricing environment as well as robust demand for Micron's memory chips used in data centres to power artificial intelligence.\n\n\"With the advent of AI, we are in the most exciting period that I have seen for memory and storage in my career,\" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said during a call with investors Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn its full-year results, released on Wednesday, Micron posted revenues of $25.1bn, up from $15.5bn last year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer plummeted in the previous session, closing 12% in the red, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nA spokesperson was not available to respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nThe company, which sells servers for data centres, has seen a growing demand amid the AI boom.\n\nLast month, Super Micro announced that it would be delayed in filing its annual report, saying that it needed more time to complete its assessment of the \"operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting\".\n\nA day prior to that announcement, Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position in the company and claimed it had found \"fresh evidence of accounting manipulation\".\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe still-young history of generative AI has been littered with grand predictions about its being a transformative technology.\n\nBut in the past few months, skepticism has crept in. Generative AI darling Nvidia has bumped along, unable to reattain the record high it hit in June. The New York Times profiled Goldman Sachs’ resident AI skeptic, head of research Jim Covello.\n\nEnter consulting giant Bain & Company and a big, new forecast: “The market for AI-related hardware and software is expected to grow between 40% and 55% annually, reaching between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027.”\n\nThe chairman of Bain’s Global Technology & Cloud Services practice and an author of the report, David Crawford, told Yahoo Finance in an interview that companies of all sizes are throwing money at AI, not just the hyperscalers.\n\n“We were astonished to see the rate at which, for example, the number of companies spending over $100 million in their annual IT budget alone on AI and with large enterprises, that's doubled,” Crawford said.\n\nCritically, he added, it’s across the board, with smaller enterprises doubling their spend.\n\n“You can pick any kind of spend or IT budget threshold and they're almost uniformly increasing their spend,” said Crawford.\n\nBain’s forecast, coupled with Micron’s increased forecast of strong demand for its AI-powering high-bandwidth memory chips, has given the generative AI trade a little zhuzh this week.\n\n“I don't think that we are anywhere near even the midpoint in terms of AI spending cycle,” BlackRock’s Kate Moore told Yahoo Finance. An Nvidia automotive gauge chip is pictured at the 2024 Mobile World Congress (MWC Shanghai) in Shanghai, China, June 26, 2024. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\nMost investors who are bulls on the broader AI theme seem to agree despite some of the AI trade’s growth numbers coming back to earth after stratospheric initial gains. And yet, there’s been a pattern this year of AI plays running up, then pulling back as traders question valuations and monetization potential. Then they run up again and the cycle starts anew.\n\nMoore likened the current period to building out infrastructure in a new city.\n\n“You can't expect a city to flourish if it doesn't have roads and sewers and public transportation,” she said. “And I'd say the same thing. I think these hyperscalers know what they're doing. They already feel like the spend is a small amount of their potential total return.”\n\nThe motion sickness-inducing up-and-down in the stocks may be set to continue, however, as Bain’s report also points out there could be other speed bumps ahead. The authors write that software companies’ revenue growth is slowing as they’re under pressure to demonstrate greater, generative AI-driven efficiency. Meanwhile, the demand for AI could spark a semiconductor shortage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, of course, there are investors who think all of the spending is priced in. One of them is Michael Darda, Roth Capital Partners chief economist and macrostrategist.\n\n“I don't doubt that what's going on here is revolutionary,” he said in an interview. “But I also think there's quite a bit of hype and if you look at these periods of innovation in the past, they always are associated with what look like bubbles or mini bubbles, if you want to use that word. Typically what you don't see is just a leveling off at historically high or record valuation levels and going sideways for an indefinite period. Typically, things start to tip over a bit.” morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are Street Analysts Bullish On NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Most Active Stocks To Invest In Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other active stocks.\n\nAre Additional Rate Cuts a Necessity?\n\nThe economic landscape is currently marked by mixed signals. The Fed has indicated the potential for additional rate cuts due to weaknesses in the manufacturing sector, despite signs of recovery. While the overall economy remains strong, currency dynamics have shifted, with the US dollar weakening and the euro strengthening. Interest rate yields have fluctuated, suggesting potential changes in investor sentiment. Amidst this complex environment, the Dow continues to hover near record highs, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants.\n\nAs stakeholders navigate these developments, they will need to carefully consider how they may influence investment strategies and market behavior in the coming months. CNBC's Rick Santelli recently covered this situation, which we talked about in our article on the 10 Best Performing Stocks in 2024. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has indicated that many more rate cuts may be necessary over the next year due to signs of weakness in the manufacturing sector. CNBC’s Rick Santelli, who was reporting on September 23, noted that while manufacturing has faced challenges, there are indications it might be recovering slightly, as evidenced by a recent production increase of 0.8%.\n\nHe referenced comments.... that the economy is experiencing strong growth and robust consumer spending, which he believed contradicted the concerns raised by Goolsbee. Santelli pointed out that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently at all-time highs, suggesting that market sentiment remains positive despite underlying economic weaknesses.\n\nFurther discussing the economic landscape, he remarked on the currency markets, noting that the US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since March 2022. In contrast, the euro has reached its strongest level since April 2022. This shift in currency dynamics reflects broader economic trends...”\n\nHowever, a lot of analysts do not have an opinion as nuanced as that of Santelli. For instance, Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler's chief investment strategist joined CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on September 23 to discuss why smaller businesses and consumers need the benefits from more rate cuts.\n\nIn a conversation regarding the challenges facing US car manufacturers, it was noted that the biggest threat they encounter is the influx of Chinese automobiles into the US market. This concern contrasted with the insights from the President of the Bank of Chicago, who stated that ongoing rate cuts will continue to benefit smaller businesses and consumers who are currently adjusting to higher interest rates. Kantrowitz emphasized the significant impact that lower interest rates can have on the consumer economy, particularly given the substantial amount of debt tied to credit lines and credit cards. As adjustable-rate mortgages decrease, this easing of financial conditions is expected to be beneficial.\n\nKantrowitz pointed out that before last week, financial conditions had been easing primarily for larger corporations, as evidenced by the S&P 500, which did not require a rate cut. However, small businesses and consumers, who are more closely tied to the prime rate set by banks, had not experienced similar relief until recently. The last report indicated that small businesses were paying an interest rate of 9.5% for 3-month borrowing. This recent easing represents a crucial first step for Main Street, although the strategist believes further cuts are necessary.\n\nHe noted a broadening market trend following the July 11 CPI report, highlighting that commercial real estate has emerged as one of the best-performing sectors this quarter, alongside utilities and regional banks. However, it was emphasized that while rate cuts can benefit certain areas indirectly, such as those affected by lower tenure rates, they do not necessarily provide direct support.\n\nLooking ahead at interest rates, there was speculation about how low they might go in the next year. Kantrowitz suggested that policy rates could indeed fall into the 3% range but cautioned that markets might be overly aggressive in their expectations. The anticipated rise in unemployment will play a critical role in shaping equity and fixed-income markets; however, if unemployment increases at a slow and steady pace, as it has been, it may not pose significant challenges to market stability.\n\nKantrowitz's opinion reflects a cautious optimism regarding economic conditions as stakeholders face uncertain conditions while keeping an eye on interest rates and their broader implications for various sectors within the economy.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe sifted through Yahoo Finance's list of the most active stocks that are experiencing high trading volumes. We looked at the top 15 stocks to find the ones that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We then narrowed down our list to the 10 stocks with high trading volumes and that were the most popular among hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their trading volumes, as of September 23.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nVolume: 120.458 million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 327.422 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells graphics processing units (GPUs), artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and other computing technologies. Its GPUs are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, and AI applications, and the company has been a pioneer in the field of GPU computing, with a significant role in the development of AI and deep learning.\n\nIn FQ2 2025, the company's revenue was 122.40% from a year-ago period. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers contributed ~45% of data center revenue. Partnerships with healthcare institutions and increasing demand for AI-powered solutions in diagnostics have contributed to this strong financial performance.\n\nAt its GPU Technology Conference earlier this year, the CEO estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion, with a potential total of $1-2 trillion over the next decade. The company won't dominate the entire market, but analysts estimate its market share between 2025 and 2029 will be over $950 billion.\n\nElon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has brought Colossal, an AI training system, online. Powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colossal is the most powerful AI training system in the world. Musk plans to double the size of Colossal by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. Blackwell chips, which are even faster and more efficient, could further enhance Colossal's capabilities.\n\nThe company faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact demand. The company's future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025, it aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most active stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\n\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\n\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\n\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\n\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\n\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\n\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a software and fabless company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, that provides graphics computing and networking solutions. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now, with its share price having grown by over 2000% in the last five years, driven by strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPU) and AI models.\n\nIt remains the go-to company for cloud computing firms – including tech giants – looking to procure graphics processing units (GPUs) and semiconductors as they increase investments in artificial intelligence. This has been the catalyst behind NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s financial growth in the last few years.\n\nThe results continue to be strong. During Q2 FY25, the company generated a revenue of $30 billion, increasing 122% year-over-year, and 15% sequentially, fueled by surging demand for data center chips. It was well above the outlook of $28 billion. Net income for the quarter totaled $16.6 billion, resulting in EPS of $0.68, beating expectations of $0.645. For Q3, the company expects total revenue to be $32.5 billion, with gross margins between 74.4% to 75%. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also anticipates continued growth for Hopper Architecture and Blackwell products during the second half of the year.\n\nThere is consensus among Street analysts on the stock’s Strong Buy rating, with its share price projected for a further 24% growth in the coming months. Investors also remain bullish on the stock. Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.

        "title": "Wall Street's 2 Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stocks Are Stealing the Spotlight Next Week",
        "content": "While there's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has played a key role in sending all three major U.S. stock indexes to multiple record-closing highs in 2024, the excitement surrounding stock splits has played a close second fiddle in lifting valuations.\n\nA stock split gives publicly traded companies the ability to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude, while having no effect on their market cap or underlying operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThough there are two distinct types of stock splits, investors gravitate to one far more than the other. Reverse-stock splits, which are the less sought after type, are designed to increase a company's share price. These splits are usually completed by struggling businesses that are attempting to meet the minimum continued listing standards of a major stock exchange.\n\nOn the other hand, investors usually flock to companies conducting forward-stock splits. A forward split reduces a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for everyday investors and/or employees who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. This is the type of split high-flying companies with clear-cut competitive advantages undertake.\n\nSince late January, a little over a dozen brand-name or high-profile companies have announced or completed a stock split -- and all but one is of the forward-split variety.\n\nAlthough market-leading AI stocks Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) have, arguably, been Wall Street's most-anticipated splits of 2024, they're going to be forced to cede the spotlight to two new artificial intelligence stock-split stocks next week.\n\nNo stock splits drew more buzz in 2024 than Nvidia and Broadcom\n\nAccording to a 2023 report (\"Sizing the Prize\") from PwC, the AI revolution has the ability to add $15.7 trillion to the U.S. economy by 2030, with a combination of productivity gains and consumption side effects driving the charge. With an addressable market this large, it's really no surprise that Nvidia and Broadcom have garnered so much interest.\n\nWith its market value climbing by well over $2 trillion since the start of 2023, Nvidia's board declared a historic 10-for-1 forward split, which went into effect following the close of trading on June 7. Meanwhile, Broadcom's first-ever stock split, also 10-for-1, was announced in mid-June and completed after the close of trading on July 12.\n\nNvidia finds itself on the leading edge of the AI wave because its AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undisputed top choice for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and build/train large language models (LLMs). TechInsights estimates Nvidia accounted for approximately 98% of all GPU shipments to data centers in 2022 and 2023, and the extensive backlog of its ultra-popular H100 GPU suggests it still maintains a near-monopoly share of the AI-GPU market.\n\nStory continues\n\nEqually important, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is keeping enterprise clients loyal to its array of products and services. CUDA is the toolkit used by developers to build LLMs and get the most they can out of their Nvidia GPUs.\n\nBroadcom is the equivalent of Nvidia, but from an AI networking solutions standpoint. Its solutions are being counted on to reduce tail latency in AI-accelerated data centers and maximize the computing capacity of AI-GPUs. The bulk of Broadcom's sales growth is coming from its AI-driven ecosystem at the moment.\n\nBut Broadcom has a considerably more diverse revenue stream than Nvidia. In addition to its AI prowess, it's a leading provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones, optical components for industrial equipment, networking products for new vehicles, cybersecurity solutions, and private/hybrid cloud solutions for businesses.\n\nWhile these two AI juggernauts will continue to be leaders, their time in the spotlight among AI stock-split stocks is over. Next week, two high-flying AI stock splits will take center stage. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nThe first AI stock ready to take its place among the Class of 2024 stock-split stocks is customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Super Micro's board authorized a 10-for-1 split in early August, which is set to take effect following the close of trading on Sept. 30. This will be its first split since becoming a publicly traded company in March 2007.\n\nWhile Nvidia's GPUs are the brains behind AI-accelerated data centers and Broadcom is the leading provider of AI networking solutions, Super Micro Computer is the go-to infrastructure company for businesses wanting to build out their high-compute data centers. Super Micro enjoyed 110% growth in net sales in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), and it's forecasting 87% sales growth at the midpoint of its revenue guide ($28 billion) for the current fiscal year.\n\nSuper Micro has been particularly popular because it incorporates Nvidia's H100 into its customizable rack servers. Just keep in mind that orders for the H100 are backlogged, which has the potential to adversely impact Super Micro's ability to meet the needs of its customers.\n\nSomething else to consider about Super Micro Computer is that it's dealt with hyped growth expectations before and tripped up. Shares of the company surged in the mid-2010s on the idea that its infrastructure solutions would be in high demand given the lofty expectations tied to enterprise cloud computing. Unfortunately, these aggressive growth forecasts weren't sustainable.\n\nHistorically speaking, every next-big-thing innovation or technology for the last 30 years has needed time to mature. AI is highly unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule, which may leave Super Micro's aggressive growth forecasts vulnerable to downside revisions.\n\nLastly, Super Micro is also reportedly facing an early stage probe from the U.S. Justice Department, per The Wall Street Journal, following a short-seller report from Hindenburg Research that alleged \"accounting manipulation.\" While the company has denied Hindenburg's report, the delayed filing of its annual report isn't helping matters.\n\nDespite being remarkably cheap for a high-growth AI stock -- just over 10 times forward-year earnings -- Super Micro has a lot to prove to Wall Street and investors.\n\nLam Research\n\nThe second AI stock-split stock that will be taking the spotlight away from Nvidia and Broadcom this coming week is semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX).\n\nLam's board approved a 10-for-1 stock split and authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program on May 21, with the company's split -- it's first since 2000 -- taking place following the close of trading on Oct. 2. Chief Financial Officer Doug Bettinger has noted that his company intends to return \"75% to 100% of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\"\n\nLam's role in the burgeoning AI ecosystem is to supply the wafer fabrication equipment used by semiconductor companies to manufacture AI solutions. In particular, its equipment plays a key role in the packaging of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is critical to the needs of AI-accelerated data centers. As demand for GPUs and HBM rises, so does the need for Lam's equipment.\n\nWhile Lam Research isn't growing at the same breakneck pace as Super Micro Computer, it's delivering steady mid-to-high teens sales growth and should sustain low-double-digit earnings-per-share growth through 2028.\n\nBut even Wall Street's top AI companies contend with headwinds. The biggest concern for Lam is that U.S. regulators have clamped down on AI-related chip and equipment exports to China over the last two years. In the June-ended quarter, 39% of Lam's sales can be traced to China, making it more important than any geographic region. If regulators continue to take a hard-line stance with China, Lam's ceiling may be limited.\n\nThere are also quite a few warnings that the U.S. economy may be steering toward a recession. Lam Research is highly cyclical (as are the other AI stocks discussed here) and would likely see future order activity weaken if U.S. or global economic activity slowed or shifted into reverse\n\nAlthough Lam Research looks to have more long-term upside than Super Micro, it still possesses near-term risks to investors after a mammoth run higher for its shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Q2 Earnings Highlights: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Vs The Rest Of The Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and the best and worst performers in the processors and graphics chips industry.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nWhile some processors and graphics chips stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they have collectively declined. On average, share prices are down 1.3% since the latest earnings results.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 11.1% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a decent beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and strong sales guidance for the next quarter. Qualcomm Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 4.8% since reporting and currently trades at $172.03.\n\nRead why we think that Qualcomm is one of the best processors and graphics chips stocks, our full report is free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 2.5% since reporting. It currently trades at $122.50.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia?

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. The stock is flat since the results and currently trades at $54.39.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This result beat analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. Overall, it was a strong quarter as it also produced an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nThe stock is down 11.7% since reporting and currently trades at $105.49.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qorvo here, it’s free.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n\nBroadcom reported revenues of $13.07 billion, up 47.3% year on year.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other high volume stocks.\n\nOn September 18, the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing benchmark rates by half a percentage point to counter a potential labor market slowdown. This adjustment brings the federal funds rate to 4.75% to 5%. Aside from the emergency rate cuts during the pandemic, the last time the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) made a half-point reduction was during the 2008 global financial crisis. Following the decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made the following remarks:\n\n“We’re trying to achieve a situation where we restore price stability without the kind of painful increase in unemployment that has come sometimes with this inflation. That’s what we’re trying to do, and I think you could take today’s action as a sign of our strong commitment to achieve that goal.\"\n\nThe post-meeting statement emphasized that the Federal Reserve has grown more confident in inflation moving sustainably toward the 2% target. It believes the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are now roughly balanced. Wall Street expects that the ensuing rate cuts will enable well-established, financially stable companies to boost spending and investments, potentially driving up their stock prices through the remainder of 2024 and into early 2025. Similarly, Wells Fargo analysts suggest that the global economy stands to benefit as many major central banks have already announced or are expected to announce rate cuts. However, not everyone is optimistic. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio highlighted that the U.S. economy continues to grapple with an \"enormous amount of debt.\" During an interview, he pointed out that the Federal Reserve faces the challenge of maintaining interest rates high enough to benefit creditors, while not raising them so much that they become burdensome for debtors. Dalio described this as a difficult \"balancing act\".\n\nOn another front, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropped to 98.7 in September, down from 105.6 in August, marking the largest one-month decline since August 2021. This was below the Dow Jones forecast of 104 and significantly lower than the pre-pandemic level of 132.6 recorded in February 2020. All five components of the index saw declines, with the most significant drop occurring among those aged 35-54 and earning less than $50,000. The last time the index fell this sharply was when inflation was starting its rise to a 40-year high. Commenting on the sentiment shift, Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, noted:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Consumers’ assessments of current business conditions turned negative while views of the current labor market situation softened further. Consumers were also more pessimistic about future labor market conditions and less positive about future business conditions and future income.”\n\nWithin a complex economic landscape marked by mixed signals across sectors, investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with market participants closely watching economic indicators and Fed policies to identify future trends. With this in mind, we present a list of the 10 Best High Volume Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to identify stocks that met specific criteria as of September 23. Our selection criteria was focused on stocks with notable market activity, including a 3-month average trading volume exceeding 5 million shares. We also considered companies with a quarterly revenue growth rate of over 15%. Additionally, we highlighted the number of hedge funds invested in each stock, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAvg Volume: 340.04 million\n\nQuarterly Revenue Growth: 122.40%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), a sector that has experienced significant growth due to rising demand for artificial intelligence models. Over the past four quarters, NVIDIA has achieved record results, with profit margins exceeding 60%.\n\nRecently, William Blair initiated coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with an Outperform rating, recognizing the company's leadership in parallel computing and its strong position in the AI industry. The firm highlighted NVIDIA's extensive history in designing parallel computing systems, which has enabled the company to penetrate high-growth markets such as gaming, automotive, and high-performance computing (HPC). Analysts noted that NVIDIA's data center revenue soared by 217% in fiscal 2024 and is projected to grow by 132% in fiscal 2025, potentially exceeding $110 billion, up from just $15 billion in fiscal 2023. William Blair also emphasized that NVIDIA's system-level approach has expanded its total addressable market from approximately $100 billion in GPUs to a broader $800 billion semiconductor market and a $1.6 trillion cloud services market.\n\nIn the second quarter, a total of 179 hedge funds held long positions in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a combined stake value of $53.7 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best high volume stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe that certain AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don’t waste time with underperformers—they target the market's elite.\n\nThe Stock Market Rally\n\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%–5.00% from 5.25%–5.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024—the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\n“Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we’re on our way back to 2%. So I don’t think you’re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.”\n\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed’s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\n\nWhat the Top Dogs of Wall Street are Saying About the Market\n\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

The company provides advanced graphics computing and networking solutions, and strong demand for its GPUs, particularly in gaming and AI models, has driven NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nNVIDIA's impressive rally continues to heavily influence the S&P 500, raising concerns that a downturn in the chipmaker's fortunes could impact broader market performance. The stock's 140% increase in 2024 alone has contributed to about a quarter of the S&P 500's 17% gain this year.\n\nAt NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at $250 billion, which could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next decade if investment trends persist.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey, 29 billionaires held stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the end of Q2 2024, with notable investors including Rajiv Jain, Ken Fisher, Israel Englander, and Ken Griffin.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe that there are under-the-radar AI stocks trading at highly discounted valuations that hold greater promise for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio.

        "title": "China’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t",
        "content": "Wall Street mega investors have recently made Chinese stocks their home for billions, especially as the government takes new stimulus measures. Cutting rates places stocks like Alibaba and Baidu in a much better position than their peers, Amazon and Google. Wall Street analysts agree with this setup, placing double-digit upside potential in these stocks for the coming quarters.\n\nEven though the Chinese stock market has been scrutinized extensively in the past couple of years, some investors have begun to realize that there is much more upside than apparent risk for Asia’s powerhouse. China’s technology sector has the lowest valuation in history compared to its American counterpart.\n\nMeasured through the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB), names in this space now trade at steep discounts against peers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). While discounted stocks might not look attractive to some investors based on their price action, others recognize the value to be had in them.\n\nThis is why stocks like Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and the overall iShares MSCI China ETF have delivered shareholders a significant rally this week, one of the best performances since the few months after the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail investors can also feel a bit safer because some of Wall Street’s favorite investors have also given these companies a chance to make billions.\n\nChinese Government Interventions Improve the Risk-Reward Balance for Investors\n\nRecently, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) in the United States decided to lower interest rates by half a percent, or 50 basis points. The Chinese economy has been criticized long enough for its slowdown and contractions, so the government has also decided to cut rates by the same amount.\n\nThe difference is that the Chinese ETF trades at only 47% of the high prices it made in early 2021, while the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index trades at 96% of its 52-week high now. This means that the potential reward is much bigger in China than the pullback the U.S. technology space could make after these runs.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller decided to sell out of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after realizing the potential upside was no longer that attractive; it is no surprise to see his former mentor and boss George Soros initiate a $73.4 million position in Alibaba.\n\nAs lower rates start to spread through the Chinese economy, the consumer discretionary sector and rate-dependent technology companies will probably see the benefits first, so they have become the top choice for other mega investors as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWho’s Buying Chinese Stocks Now and What They’re Adding to Their Portfolios\n\nSome investors would recognize him for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, but Michael Burry has now made Alibaba his top holding. After buying it for the better part of 2024, Burry’s portfolio is now reported to hold up to 155,000 shares valued at roughly $14.8 million today.\n\nThe trend doesn’t end there for Burry, as he also chose Baidu as his fourth-largest position, with 75,000 shares valued at approximately $9 million. Coming right after Baidu, Burry chose JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to be his fifth-largest position, with 250,000 shares carrying a value of $8.3 million today.\n\nThose names are the common choice among investors today. David Tepper has recently deviated from his typical picks in the financial and technology sector to pick on Chinese stocks. For Tepper, his fund bought up to 10,500,000 shares for an approximate value of just over $1 billion in the portfolio.\n\nConsidering that Alibaba trades at less than a third of the $316 a share high it made after COVID-19, it makes sense for these investors to look at the potential risk-to-reward ratios and decide if it is worth taking a risk on Chinese stocks.\n\nWall Street’s Latest Take on Alibaba and Baidu: Key Insights for Investors\n\nStarting with Alibaba, analysts now justify a consensus price target of $107.6 a share on the stock, calling for 12.7% upside from where it trades today. However, those at Susquehanna decided to go above and beyond the consensus and place a $130 valuation on Alibaba, implying it could run by a much bigger 35.4% from today’s price.\n\nWhen it comes to Baidu, the stock trades at only 68% of its 52-week high to offer enough potential upside to consider it. This is why analysts at Citigroup see a potential case for the stock to trade as high as $155 a share, daring the stock to stage a massive 64.8% rally from where it has traded down to today.\n\nHere are other insights for investors to consider: Alibaba’s main competitor could be assumed to be Amazon, which is why the Chinese giant’s 25.1x P/E ratio means a significant discount to Amazon’s 46.0x valuation today. For Baidu, competition can only arguably be found in shares of Google.\n\nBaidu’s 12.4x P/E valuation would also offer investors a steep discount compared to Google’s valuation of 23.3x P/E today, despite a recent selloff in that stock. When it comes to upside and diminished risk, investors all over are finding Chinese stocks to be the winners; maybe retail investors should, too.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t\n\nWhy Small-Cap Stocks Could Be Ready to Outperform After Rate Cuts\n\nHealthcare Stocks Poised to Shine?

        "title": "Micron: Q4 Revenues Jump 93% YoY as AI Boom Fuels Momentum",
        "content": "Micron Technologies hits its stride. Its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 report revealed how AI and data center strength drove revenues higher by 93.3% YoY to $7.75 billion, crushing consensus estimates by $100 million. Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are custom-tailored for AI applications, including computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) to bolster training and inference. Micron raised its fiscal first quarter 2025 revenue guidance as its CEO was upbeat, stating they were entering 2025 in the strongest position in its history, ready to generate record revenues.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) proved the doubters and analysts wrong with a Babe Ruth-style homerun earnings report that saw revenues nearly double YoY driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The irony is that at least three analysts downgraded, trimmed estimates or lowered price targets for Micron ahead of its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, sending shares as low as $84.12 on Sept. 12, 2024. MarketBeat analysts thought otherwise, citing the 4 Reasons to Buy the 44% Price Drop and looking to Capitalize on Micron’s 24% Drop.\n\nMicron's solid AI-driven demand-powered earnings report helped lift the computer and technology sector, driving shares of memory device makers like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) higher.\n\nMicron Finally Reaps AI Boom Benefits With Strong Q4 Results\n\nThe market had been waiting for Micron to show evidence of benefitting from the AI boom, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as illustrated in their earnings blowouts. Yet, prior earnings and guidance were tepid and in line. This prompted many downgrades citing concerns that AI alone couldn't help slumping spot DRAM prices and inventory glut hurting its non-AI business like PCs and smartphones.\n\nMicron's fiscal fourth-quarter of 2024 earnings report put all doubts to rest. The company reported EPS of $1.18, beating consensus estimates by 7 cents. Revenues surged 93.3% YoY to $7.75 billion, crushing consensus estimates by over $100 million. Non-GAAP gross margin rose to 36.5%, up from 28.1% sequentially.\n\nAI and Data Centers Stole the Show\n\nRobust AI demand fueled the surge in its data center DRAM products and industry-leading high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which have already been booked until 2025. However, Micron's recently announced acquisition of 2 Taiwan factories was meant to boost its capacity for these red-hot chops. HBM chips are tailor-made for AI applications like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.\n\nMicron Technology CEO Sanjay Mehrotra didn't downplay his excitement, stating, “We are entering fiscal 2025 with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history. We forecast record revenue in fiscal Q1 and a substantial revenue record with significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025.”\n\nThe company hit record NAND revenue led by data center and SSD sales, which exceeded $1 billion for the first time.\n\nMicron Ups the Ante and Raises Guidance\n\nMicron Technology raised its fiscal first-quarter of 2025 EPS to $1.66 to $1.82 versus consensus estimates of $1.52. First-quarter revenues are expected to be between $8.50 billion and $8.90 billion, crushing the $8.27 billion consensus estimates. Non-GAAP margin is expected to be around 39.5% +/- 1%.\n\nMicron Technology EVP Manish Bhatia notes that the demand for traditional servers will continue to grow and improve as IT software deployment continues. Modest unit growth is expected for general server growth. However, AI servers are expected to be robust in 2025 as AI momentum continues. Micron has strengthened its position with HBM growth in AI servers with its high capacity 128 gigabyte DIMMs being used in AI servers for training and inferencing. Both enterprise AI and cloud servers are driving demand.\n\nMU Stock Completes a Cup Pattern\n\nA cup pattern forms on a swing-high lip line that falls to a swing-low, forming a rounding bottom that rises back up to retest the cup lip line.\n\nFrom there, a handle may form on a pullback or a continuation above the cup lip line, which acts as a new floor support. Micron Stock Price Chart\n\nMU formed its cup lip line around $110.39 and sold off to the $84.91 swing low, and the multiple pre-earnings report analyst downgrades and price cuts. MU rose to the $96.18 level driven by the divergence bottom formed on the daily RSI heading into its fiscal Q4 2024 earnings release.\n\nThe solid report triggered a price gap to the $110.58 gap fill level, competing with the cup pattern. MU will either use the cup lip line as a floor support and trend higher or pullback to form a handle, forming a potential cup-and-handle breakout if it successfully surges back up through the cup lip line. RSI rose to the 70-band. Fibonacci (Fib) pullback support levels are at $110.39, $104.48, $98.52, and $89.97.\n\nMicron Technology’s average consensus price target is $146.04, and its highest analyst price target is $225.00. Analysts have given it 25 Buy ratings, one Hold rating, and one Sell rating.\n\nWith MU’s large gap following earnings, it’s best not to chase. Bullish investors can buy on pullbacks using cash-secured puts to take advantage of the elevated premiums at the fib pullback support levels to buy the dip and write covered calls to execute a wheel strategy for income in addition to the 0.41% annual dividend yield.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMicron: Q4 Revenues Jump 93% YoY as AI Boom Fuels Momentum\n\nJefferies Stock Falls After Strong Earnings: Time to Buy?\n\nWhy Small-Cap Stocks Could Be Ready to Outperform After Rate Cuts\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\n\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\n\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

However, recent remarks by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, during the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, in which he said that the new chips were in full production and the firm expected to start shipping them in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. The start of Blackwell shipping would translate to around $10 billion in revenue for the chip firm, according to chip analysts.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NasdaqGS:NVDA) Strengthens AI Leadership with Salesforce Alliance and Record Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "NVIDIA(NasdaqGS:NVDA) is navigating a dynamic period marked by both impressive growth and significant challenges. Recent highlights include record-breaking revenue growth driven by the Data Center segment and innovative product launches, counterbalanced by increased operating expenses and competitive pressures in China. In the discussion that follows, we will explore NVIDIA's core advantages, critical issues, growth opportunities, and key risks to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\n\nNavigate through the intricacies of NVIDIA with our comprehensive report here. NasdaqGS:NVDA Earnings and Revenue Growth as at Sep 2024\n\nStrengths: Core Advantages Driving Sustained Success For NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional financial health, with record-breaking revenue growth. In Q2, revenue reached $30 billion, marking a 15% sequential increase and a 122% year-on-year rise. This performance is largely driven by the Data Center segment, which reported $26.3 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and 154% year-on-year. Additionally, the company boasts high gross margins, with GAAP gross margins at 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins at 75.7%. The strong demand for NVIDIA's products, particularly from frontier model makers and generative AI applications, further underscores its market leadership. Furthermore, innovative product launches like the NVIDIA H200 platform have bolstered its competitive edge, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise companies. NVIDIA's seasoned management team, with an average tenure of 15.7 years, has been instrumental in steering the company towards these impressive achievements.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into NVIDIA's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\n\nWeaknesses: Critical Issues Affecting NVIDIA's Performance and Areas For Growth\n\nNVIDIA faces several challenges. The company's GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were down sequentially due to inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and a higher mix of new products within the Data Center. Operating expenses also increased by 12% sequentially, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs. Additionally, the competitive market in China poses a significant risk, with Data Center revenue from China remaining below previous levels due to export controls. Furthermore, while NVIDIA is considered a good option compared to its peers with a Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 57.4x versus the peer average of 102.4x, it appears expensive relative to the US Semiconductor industry average of 26.9x. The stock is also trading above the estimated fair value of $94.06, suggesting potential overvaluation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo dive deeper into how NVIDIA's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of NVIDIA's Valuation.\n\nOpportunities: Potential Strategies for Leveraging Growth and Competitive Advantage\n\nNVIDIA has several promising opportunities to further enhance its market position. The expansion in sovereign AI, as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure as national imperatives, presents significant growth potential. The enterprise AI wave has also started, with enterprises driving sequential revenue growth in the quarter. NVIDIA plans to launch new Spectrum-X products annually to meet the growing demand for scaling compute clusters. Additionally, the demand for Blackwell platforms is expected to remain high, well above supply, into the next year. The company's strategic alliances, such as the collaboration with Salesforce to develop advanced AI capabilities for the enterprise, further strengthen its competitive advantage.\n\nThreats: Key Risks and Challenges That Could Impact NVIDIA's Success\n\nSeveral external factors pose risks to NVIDIA's sustained success. The competitive market in China remains a significant challenge, with expectations of continued competitiveness. Economic factors impacting capital expenditures (CapEx) are also a concern, as debated by market analysts regarding the sustainability of CapEx investments by NVIDIA's customers. Regulatory issues are another potential threat, as the company must maintain compliance with evolving regulations to sustain its market leadership. Additionally, significant insider selling over the past three months raises concerns about potential internal challenges. These factors could impact NVIDIA's growth and market share in the long term.\n\nConclusion\n\nNVIDIA's impressive financial health and market leadership, driven by strong revenue growth and high gross margins, position it well for continued success, particularly in the Data Center and AI segments. However, challenges such as increased operating expenses, competitive pressures in China, and a higher Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to the US Semiconductor industry average suggest potential headwinds. Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strategic initiatives, including its expansion into sovereign AI and enterprise AI, along with strong demand for its innovative products, offer substantial growth opportunities. Investors should weigh these factors carefully, considering the stock's current trading price relative to its estimated fair value and the broader industry context, to make informed decisions about the company's future performance.\n\nTaking Advantage\n\nAlready own NVIDIA?

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed the most recent trading day at $124.04, moving +0.43% from the previous trading session. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.4% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.62%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.6%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had lost 1.67% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.91% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.71% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Nvidia in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.74, reflecting an 85% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $32.59 billion, reflecting a 79.88% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.81 per share and revenue of $124.17 billion. These totals would mark changes of +116.15% and +103.82%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 3.59% higher within the past month. Currently, Nvidia is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Nvidia is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.88. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.65, which means Nvidia is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, NVDA's PEG ratio is currently 1.05. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - General industry was having an average PEG ratio of 3.92.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 181, putting it in the bottom 29% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow NVDA in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "NVIDIA Stock Post 3-Month Split: Buy, Hold, or Sell?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA was the top performer on the S&P 500 in 2023 and continued its upward movement this year due to its sheer dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA stock breezed past $1,000 in early 2024, making it inaccessible for many investors. So, a stock split was initiated in early June. Let’s examine NVIDIA’s performance following the split to determine its present investment potential.\n\nNVIDIA Stock Performance – Positive After Stock Split\n\nIn May, NVIDIA declared its intention to split its stock in a 10-for-1 ratio. Immediately after the announcement, the stock climbed from around $900 to more than $1,000. Between the announcement and the split date (Friday, June 7), NVIDIA stock soared about 30%. Post-split, it opened on June 10 at about $120, now trading at around $123, marking a more than 2% increase.\n\nNVIDIA stock, historically, has gained two out of three times in the three months following a stock split. A Statista report using Bank of America Corporation’s BAC data found that companies that split their stocks had an average return of more than 25% in the 12 months post-split, double the S&P 500’s average return in the same period.\n\nFed Rate Cuts Boost NVIDIA Stock\n\nAfter the split, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. The Fed trimmed interest rates by 50 basis points to support economic growth. The Fed eased its monetary policy for the first time in four years.\n\nLower interest rates are expected to reduce NVIDIA’s borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Lower interest rates also don’t affect NVIDIA’s cash flows necessary for growth initiatives.\n\nGoing back to the 1990s, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 20.7% in the 12 months following an interest rate cut, while the S&P 500 jumped only 2.9%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nKey Tailwinds for NVIDIA Stock\n\nDominance in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market, shipment of the most sought-after Blackwell chips by year-end and significant growth in the AI market also boosted NVIDIA stock.\n\nThe widespread use of NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform over Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform has given it the bulk share in the GPU market, which is projected to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, meanwhile, assured that the high-end Blackwell chips will be available soon to cater to high demand. This is because the Blackwell chips have more AI throughput than the current Hopper chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recent report by Bain Technology showed that the AI hardware and software market is estimated to grow to $990 billion by 2027 from around $185 billion in the current year, crushing any concerns that the big cloud companies are contemplating spending big on AI.\n\nNVIDIA benefits from the AI boom as a key hardware and technology provider for AI applications. It expects revenues of $10 billion for 2024 from the government’s sovereign AI investments, a significant increase from zero last year, per the Bain Technology report.\n\nStrong Fundamentals to Drive NVIDIA Stock\n\nNVIDIA’s ability to generate profits proficiently and manage costs efficiently is likely to drive up its future share price based on its return on equity (ROE) and net profit margin.\n\nNVIDIA’s ROE is 120%, surpassing the Semiconductor - General industry’s 73.2%. Any reading above 100% indicates the company’s net income is exceeding its equity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA’s net profit margin is 55%, more than the industry’s 47.6%. Any reading above the 20% threshold indicates a high margin (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other S&P 500 Stocks Show Strong Earnings Growth). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere’s How to Trade NVIDIA Stock\n\nNVIDIA’s shares rose post-split due to macro trends and continue to be a Wall Street darling based on strong fundamentals.\n\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 23.7% from the stock’s last closing price of $120.87, while the highest price target is $200, a massive upside of 65.5%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock is currently trading above the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the 200-DMA, indicating a near-term bullish trend. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA stakeholders, therefore, should retain their market share due to the strong price upside, making selling unlikely. However, NVIDIA stock’s meteoric rise in the past few years due to the advent of AI has made the stock expensive.\n\nNew buyers, thus, should wait for an opportune moment to invest in NVIDIA. After all, per the price/earnings, the stock is trading at 43.8X, above the peer group’s 18.2X forward earnings multiple. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor now, NVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "5 Best Leveraged ETFs of the First Nine Months of 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street has been enjoying a strong rally this year, defying slowdown fears, geopolitical tensions and the steep decline in “Magnificent Seven” stocks. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones hit a series of new all-time highs and topped 5,700 and 42,000 milestones, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite Index is hovering near the 18,000 level. Most of the optimism is driven by rate cuts. \r\n\r\nThis has resulted in a huge demand for leveraged ETFs as investors look to register big gains in a short span. We have highlighted a bunch of the best-performing leveraged equity ETFs that have gained more than 70% in the first nine months of 2024. These include T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX, ProShares Ultra Semiconductors USD, Direxion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares UTSL, BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN FNGU and MicroSectors Gold 3X Leveraged ETN SHNY. These funds seek to register big gains in a short span and will continue their strong trend, at least in the near term, provided the sentiments remain bullish.\r\n\r\nLeveraged ETFs provide multiple exposures (2X or 3X) to the daily performance of the underlying index. These funds employ various investment strategies, such as the use of swaps, futures contracts and other derivative instruments to accomplish their objectives.\r\n\r\nThe technology sector was the outperformer in the first half but rate-cut optimism led to sector rotation in the third quarter. Investors shunned hot technology stocks in favor of smaller companies and the cyclical sectors, which are bigger beneficiaries of Fed rate cuts (read: 5 Sector ETFs Scaling New Highs on Fed Rate Cuts).\r\n\r\nAfter all the speculation, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell finally kicked off the new rate cycle era by initiating a 50 basis points cut in interest rates last week after holding it at a 23-year high for 14 consecutive months since July 2023. This marked the first rate cut since 2020 to address slowing economic growth and showed greater confidence in the fact that inflation is moving sustainably toward the 2% target level.\r\n\r\nLower rates lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. These help businesses expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) – Up 344%\r\n\r\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF seeks to magnify (200%) the daily performance of the NVIDIA. It has AUM of $651.6 million and an expense ratio of 1.05%. T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF trades in an average daily volume of 8.4 million shares.\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors (USD) – Up 123.5%\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors offers two times exposure to the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. It has gathered $1.1 billion in its asset base and charges 95 bps in fees per year from investors. USD trades in an average daily volume of 717,000 shares.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares (UTSL) – Up 88.9%\r\n\r\nWith AUM of $57.4 million, Direxion Daily Utilities Bull 3X Shares offers three times exposure to the performance of the Utilities Select Sector Index. It charges investors an annual fee of 95 bps and trades in a lower average daily volume of 170,000 shares.\r\n\r\nBMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGU) – Up 82.5%\r\n\r\nBMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN seeks to offer three times leveraged exposure to the NYSE FANG Index. The Index includes 10 highly liquid stocks that represent industry leaders across today’s tech and Internet/media companies.

Additionally, the daily rebalancing — when combined with leverage — may make these products deviate significantly from the expected long-term performance figures (see: all the Leveraged Equity ETFs here).\r\n\r\nStill, for ETF investors bullish on these sectors for the near term, either of the above products can be an interesting choice. Clearly, a near-term long could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance and a belief that the trend is the friend in this corner of the investing world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a key player in the artificial intelligence server industry, is being probed by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), according to a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\n\nThe investigation follows a report by activist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, which raised concerns about accounting practices within the company, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe probe is said to be in its early stages, with a prosecutor from the U.S. attorney’s office in San Francisco reportedly seeking information related to the case, the WSJ said.\n\nThe inquiry appears connected to a whistleblower lawsuit filed in April by Bob Luong, a former employee, who accused Super Micro of accounting violations.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, Luong's lawsuit alleges that the company improperly recognized revenue from 2020 to 2022, including booking sales that had not been completed and shipping incomplete equipment to customers.\n\nSuper Micro, known for making servers using Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips for generative AI, saw its stock surge during the AI boom, but it has since plummeted after peaking at $66 billion in value earlier this year, the WSJ reported.\n\nFollowing the WSJ report, SMCI shares are down around 12% on Thursday.\n\nIn its August report, Hindenburg also highlighted transactions between Super Micro and companies owned by CEO Charles Liang’s family, as well as allegations of shipments to Russian companies in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe day after the report, Super Micro announced it would delay filing its annual report and had formed a board committee to review internal controls.\n\nIn a letter to customers on September 3, Liang defended the company, calling the allegations in the short-seller report “false or inaccurate,” according to the WSJ. Meanwhile, Super Micro has requested that Luong’s lawsuit be moved to arbitration, with a court hearing scheduled soon.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSuper Micro Computer probed by DoJ - WSJ\n\nMicrosoft to make $2.7 billion cloud, AI investments in Brazil\n\nSanctioned Russian billionaire Guryev defeats London lawsuit over Phosagro stake\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Oil &amp; Gas Roundup: CVX's LNG Stance, EQNR's Project Cancellation &amp; More",
        "content": "It has been a week since both oil and natural gas prices have moved up.\r\n\r\nThe headlines revolved around energy supermajor Chevron’s CVX plans on LNG investment and Equinor’s EQNR pullout of the blue hydrogen project in its native Norway. Developments associated with SLB SLB, TechnipFMC FTI and Chesapeake Energy CHK also grabbed attention.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a bullish seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose around 4.7% to close at $71.92 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased 5.4% to end at $2.434 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).\r\n\r\nThe positive crude price action was driven by the Federal Reserve’s significant 50-basis point rate cut and escalating tensions in the Middle East, fostering expectations of stronger future demand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, natural gas also settled with a gain due to forecasts for strong cooling demand.\n\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n\n1.    U.S. energy major Chevron has taken a decisive step in its energy strategy by choosing not to invest in a U.S. LNG plant. Instead, the company is shifting its focus toward selling gas directly to the market, taking full advantage of the United States’ expansive midstream market. This strategic choice, which reflects the company's long-term goals in natural gas monetization without the need for LNG conversion infrastructure, is significant for CVX and the LNG sector as a whole.\r\n\r\nChevron’s midstream head, Colin Parfitt, emphasized the company’s ability to monetize U.S. gas effectively without converting it to LNG. The robust U.S. midstream market infrastructure allows CVX to tap into lucrative natural gas deals that bypass the need for expensive LNG plant investments.\r\n\r\nThe decision to forgo an equity stake in the Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana, which is operated by Woodside Energy, reflects CVX's conservative investment approach. This LNG project, expected to produce 27.6 million tons per annum, is a significant project, and Woodside is reportedly considering selling up to a 50% stake. However, CVX has made clear that it will not be taking a direct equity position in the venture. (Chevron Focuses on Direct Gas Sales Instead of LNG Plant Investment)\r\n\r\n2. Equinor, a Norwegian state-owned energy company, has scrapped its plans to export blue hydrogen to Germany due to high costs and a lack of sufficient demand, per media reports. The move came at the heels of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's initial partnership with German energy giant RWE, which was established in January 2022 to create a hydrogen supply network aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in German power plants. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nEquinor initially expected to produce blue hydrogen from natural gas in Norway, combined with carbon capture and storage, and export it to Germany via an offshore hydrogen pipeline. However, the cost of the entire supply chain, which Equinor CEO Anders Opedal had previously estimated could reach \"tens\" of billions of euros, proved prohibitive. \r\n\r\nThe pipeline alone was projected to cost around €3 billion ($3.35 billion). Without firm long-term commitments from European buyers to import hydrogen, EQNR could not justify continuing the project. (Equinor Cancels Blue Hydrogen Export Plans to Germany Amid Low Demand)\r\n\r\n3. SLB, the U.S. oilfield service biggie, is deepening its collaboration with NVIDIA to develop cutting-edge generative AI solutions tailored for the energy industry. This partnership, building on years of collaboration, aims to accelerate the deployment of industry-specific AI models across SLB's digital platforms. These platforms, including Delfi and Lumi, will enhance the way energy professionals interact with data.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this initiative is NVIDIA NeMo, a key component of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform. By leveraging NeMo, SLB will create custom generative AI models to address the unique, data-intensive needs of the energy industry. These models will be optimized for various computing environments, from data centers to cloud-based systems and edge devices.\r\n\r\nThe integration of AI into SLB’s platforms will have wide-reaching implications for the industry. It promises to enhance subsurface exploration, streamline production operations and improve data management processes, offering researchers, scientists and engineers powerful tools for addressing complex technical challenges. By applying generative AI, these domain experts will be able to drive innovation, increase efficiency and support more sustainable practices within the energy sector. (SLB & NVIDIA Partner to Drive AI Innovation in Energy Sector)\r\n\r\n4.    UK-based oilfield service provider TechnipFMC has been awarded two major subsea contracts by Brazil’s Petrobras. These contracts are seen to be a significant step toward the development of the hydrocarbon resources in Brazil’s offshore oil fields.\r\n\r\nThe major terms of the first contract between TechnipFMC and Petrobras include designing, engineering and manufacturing flexible riser pipes, along with providing associated services like packing and storage. The first contract won by TechnipFMC is considered to be substantial as it is valued between $250 million and $500 million in inbound orders.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the second contract include designing, engineering and manufacturing the subsea production systems by TechnipFMC for deployment on the Atapu 2, Sepia 2 and Roncador projects. The company would also provide some additional services like installation support, life-of-field services and additional equipment. The second contract is equally significant for TechnipFMC as the company expects to win between $75 million and $250 million in inbound orders. (TechnipFMC Secures Two Petrobras Subsea Contracts in Brazil).\r\n\r\n5.    Natural gas player Chesapeake Energy has announced that the pending merger with Southwestern Energy is anticipated to close early in the fourth quarter of this year. Chesapeake Energy had announced the acquisition of rival natural gas firm Southwestern Energy in an all-stock deal in January 2024. The deal was valued at approximately $7 billion.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition was originally anticipated to be closed by the end of the second quarter. However, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for additional information on the transaction postponed the deal.\r\n\r\nChesapeake Energy CEO Dell'Osso commented on the current state of the U.S. natural gas market, mentioning that it is oversupplied at present. In this situation, he believes that the company should be cautious about its overall supply strategy. The post-merger company will adjust the supply as and when management believes that the oversupply issue has been resolved. (Chesapeake Energy's Merger Deal to Close Early in Q4 2024).\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance\n\nThe following table shows the price movement of some major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.\r\n\r\nCompany    Last Week    Last 6 Months\n\nXOM                  +3.7%             +0.1%\r\nCVX                  +3.6%              -8%\r\nCOP                 +6.2%              -15.7%\r\nOXY                  +1.2%              -20.5%\r\nSLB                  +6.1%              -22.9%\r\nRIG                   +9.9%             -28.8%\r\nVLO                   +0.1%             -20.7%\r\nMPC                  +0.5%             -18.8%\r\n\r\nStocks had a mostly positive week, indicative of the bullish trading in oil and gas. The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — rose 3.7% last week. However, the sector tracker has decreased 4.7% over the past six months.\n\nWhat’s Next in the Energy World?\n\nAs usual, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for guidance on the direction of the commodities. In this context, the U.S. government’s statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar. Fuel demand and the rate of stock drawdowns in the coming weeks will determine the trend in commodity prices. Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed, too.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, advised caution when it comes to buying the dip in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, citing uncertainty in the long-term growth prospects of artificial intelligence.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, Tepper revealed that while Nvidia's stock looks attractive to him, he remains hesitant about making further investments in the chipmaker.\n\n\"We sold a lot of our Nvidia. We thought [it] was too high at the time and would come down. Unfortunately, we didn't buy it when it came back down,\" Tepper told CNBC.\n\nThe hedge fund manager reduced his Nvidia holdings by more than 80% in the second quarter, bringing his stake to about $85 million by the end of June, according to CNBC.\n\nWhile Tepper acknowledged that Nvidia, a major player in the AI boom, could still have some upside, he expressed doubts about the sustainability of AI demand.\n\n\"Do you have enough power for the growth? Do you have the next generation models that can take their chip?\" he questioned, when talking to CNBC.\n\nNvidia has seen a meteoric rise, gaining close to 200% in the last 12 months and more than 157% this year. The stock is up a further 2.9% in Thursday's session, with its market cap currently sitting at well over $3 trillion.\n\nHowever, Tepper remains uncertain about whether the company can maintain this trajectory, particularly beyond 2026.\n\nHe explained that \"different things that have to happen to make the growth projections happen.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it won't happen. I'm just not smart enough to know if they will,\" he said to CNBC.\n\nTepper also highlighted his hesitation to invest in Nvidia due to the unpredictable nature of AI's impact on earnings. \"The variation of where that earnings can be is too much. So it's not my preferred vehicle,\" he told CNBC.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDavid Tepper explains why you shouldn't buy the dip in Nvidia stock\n\nCiti joins hands with Apollo for $25 billion private credit program\n\nNifty growth to contract to 10% in FY25 from 18% in FY24: BofA\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Micron stock soars as Q1 revenue forecast tops analyst estimates",
        "content": "Micron (MU) stock surged 17% before the bell on Thursday after the chipmaker forecast higher-than-expected revenue for the upcoming quarter.\n\nMicron projected first quarter revenues of $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion, above the $8.3 billion analysts anticipated.\n\nCompany executives attributed the raised guidance to a more favorable pricing environment as well as robust demand for Micron's memory chips used in data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\n\"With the advent of AI, we are in the most exciting period that I have seen for memory and storage in my career,\" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said during a call with investors Wednesday afternoon. Mehrotra said the company is entering fiscal year 2025 with \"the best competitive positioning in Micron's history.\"\n\nExecutives now expect the market for high-bandwidth memory chips used in AI data centers to increase to $25 billion in 2025, up from $5 billion this year — and heightened demand for its HBM chips to bring in multiple billions of dollars next year.\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush, JPMorgan, TD Cowen, and Raymond James reiterated their outperform rating of the stock, encouraged by Micron's comments about AI demand and recovery in its more traditional markets. For example, they pointed to recovering demand for Micron memory chips from PC and smartphone manufacturers.\n\nWedbush's Matt Bryson said Micron's first quarter outlook \"very much mirrors our belief that overall memory dynamics are likely to improve significantly\" after the beginning of next year.\n\nRaymond James analysts said, \"HBM demand continues to be strong and Micron appears firmly on track to achieve its targets.\"\n\nMicron is the first chipmaker to report quarterly results this earnings season. Its report provides an initial look at how the semiconductor sector is faring amid high expectations from Wall Street.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $7.75 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Aug. 29 — 93% higher than last year and surpassing the $7.66 billion expected by analysts, who had recently softened their expectations. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 also exceeded both the top range of Micron's guidance and the $1.11 forecast by Wall Street.\n\nMicron’s memory chip business has undergone a resurgence over the past year as Big Tech companies pour billions into the semiconductor sector for hardware to power AI data centers.\n\nMicron distinguishes itself by partnering with, rather than competing against, industry superpower Nvidia (NVDA). Micron supplies memory chips for Nvidia’s hotly demanded GPUs.\n\nStory continues The Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant in Manassas, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInvestors have staggeringly high and ever-increasing standards for AI chipmakers, which have left them often disappointed in recent months. Micron’s third quarter earnings beat did little to sway investors in late June, and shares plummeted due to its fourth quarter outlook, which came right in line with (rather than beating) Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nNvidia stock also sank after reporting quarterly earnings at the end of August. Despite more than doubling profits and beating sales forecasts, investors wanted more from the semiconductor superpower.\n\nNvidia has since rebounded, and Micron's fourth quarter results lifted its stock after an otherwise disappointing few months, which have seen shares plummet from highs in the $150 range in mid-June.\n\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (^SOX) has begun to recover from a dip at the beginning of the month as tech stocks rallied following the US Federal Reserve’s jumbo interest rate cut and the Chinese central bank’s broad stimulus package. The index is up nearly 6% over the past week.\n\nThe company is also set to benefit from a bill awaiting signature from President Joe Biden that would loosen environmental requirements for microchip projects funded by the CHIPS and Science Act. Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries of CHIPS Act funding, and the Building Chips in America Act passed by the US House of Representatives Monday would allow it to access funding for its projects in Idaho and New York faster.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia is back in the $3 trillion club — and Jensen Huang is $2 billion richer",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) chief executive Jensen Huang is $2.3 billion richer thanks to a recent bump in Nvidia stock.\n\nShares of the chip giant were up more than 2% in pre-market trading, after closing up about 2% at $123.51 apiece Wednesday. The uptick in the company’s stock brought its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, recovering ground from recent losses and bringing Nvidia back into the coveted club.\n\nHuang’s net worth now stands at $108 billion, making him the 13th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes. The CEO has a roughly 3% stake in Nvidia, which makes up the majority of his net worth.\n\nThis current uptick in Nvidia stock may be driven by Bain’s annual technology report, released Wednesday, that predicted that the market for AI products could reach as much as almost $1 trillion by 2027.\n\nThe consulting firm predicted that companies will need to make “unprecedented levels of investment in technology infrastructure” to remain on top — a positive signal to investors that mass funding of data centers and other critical AI infrastructure will remain strong.\n\n“If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said.\n\nNvidia is one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, and has become a bellwether for excitement and demand for artificial intelligence. The company has seen its bottom line balloon on demand for chips that can power the AI boom, like its Blackwell and H200 chips.\n\nIt was also the first chipmaker to reach a $2 trillion market cap in February, snagging the title of third-most valuable company in the world in March. It was briefly the most valuable company in the world this summer.\n\nBut shares have been largely trending downward for the past month. Despite an earnings beat that saw record second-quarter revenue of $30 billion for fiscal year 2025 — up 122% from a year ago — Nvidia stock is still down 2% over the past month. Shares fell as much as 12.55% in the days following the its earnings report on Aug. 29.\n\nStill, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156% so far this year. And compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Many technology stocks have been flying high over the past year, in part due to the industry's shift toward artificial intelligence (AI). That boom is creating massive competition, and many tech companies are trying to cash in.\n\nBut what tech stocks have the stamina to impress over the next 10 years, not just 10 months? To find those, you need to look for companies that are far and away the leaders in their respective markets -- and that continually innovate to stay on top. Here are three doing exactly that. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nMany investors might feel like they have missed the train with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). I get it. But it might be wise to readjust your thinking by asking yourself which companies are positioning themselves to dominate 10 years from now.\n\nNvidia is one such company, with an estimated 70% to 95% share of the AI chip market. And its recent release of the H200 AI processor, the successor to its ultra-popular H100 chip, already has more demand than supply, according to management.\n\nTo understand how big AI demand will be in the coming years, Goldman Sachs says companies will spend $1 trillion over the next few years to build their AI ambitions. If that figure sounds too abstract, consider that Reuters recently reported that nations worldwide are investing in their own AI systems, including the Japanese government, which is building an AI supercomputer using thousands of Nvidia H200s.\n\nInvestors likely won't see the same gains Nvidia has seen over the past couple of years, but with the AI race just beginning, it still has plenty of time to run. While not cheap at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 41, shares are down about 8% over the past three months. That recent pullback opens up a potential buying opportunity for investors looking for a decade-long AI play.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nIf you're interested in choosing an AI investment that's a little off the beaten path, then Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) could be the tech stock for you. The company is benefiting from a niche in the AI market with its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are increasingly in demand.\n\nThese chips help with general-purpose AI tasks, and leading tech companies including Meta and Alphabet are tapping into them to meet their artificial intelligence goals. Demand for ASICs has risen as companies fight for AI dominance, tripling Broadcom's AI sales in the most recent quarter to $3.1 billion.\n\nManagement says it will finish 2024 with an estimated $12 billion in AI revenue, up from its previous estimate of $11 billion. And there could be more on the way. Estimates from J.P. Morgan put Broadcom's total addressable market for AI chips at $150 billion over the next four to five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf all that weren't enough, Broadcom recently made a strategic investment when it bought software company VMware, which it is using to sell cloud platform services to companies wanting a private cloud or hybrid cloud system (a mix of public and private). These cloud computing platforms will become increasingly important to companies looking to set up their own AI cloud systems in the coming years.\n\nBroadcom's shares currently trade at a forward P/E of about 27, making the stock far less expensive than some of its AI chip rivals.\n\n3. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity is a problem that will never quite go away, especially as criminals find new ways to thwart existing systems. The good news is that there are companies, including CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD), at the leading edge of security that enlist AI in the fight.\n\nCrowdStrike has used AI in its Falcon security platform for years, but it has made it even smarter by launching Charlotte AI last year for security analysts. The integrated generative AI system allows analysts to find threats and fix problems, and management says companies that use Charlotte AI save two hours daily in their security operations.\n\nThe company's lead in this space could continue to pay off in the decade ahead as more companies rely on AI for security. Morgan Stanley estimates that by 2035, AI cybersecurity will be a $135 billion market, nine times larger than it was in 2021.\n\nCrowdStrike's customers have already experienced the benefits of its platform and are signing up for more services. About 65% of customers in the second quarter adopted five or more security modules on Falcon, and 45% have six or more.\n\nCrowdStrike's stock is a bit expensive, with a forward P/E of 82. But the stock's recent dip of about 20% over the past three months has opened up a buying opportunity for this tech leader that's at the forefront of AI cybersecurity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAt the start of the new year, Amazon (AMZN) employees will be required to work from their offices five days a week, tightening a rule that allowed some work from home in a bid to revitalize company culture — and realize CEO Andy Jassy’s broader shift toward restructuring and belt-tightening.\n\nThe successor to Amazon’s long-reigning CEO, Jeff Bezos, sees it as a top priority to strengthen internal culture.\n\n“We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” he wrote in a memo to employees earlier this month. For years he has worked to improve on the Everything Store’s cost structure and operating margins. And on top of operations, the company faces other challenges, from upstart discount retailers to the nagging perception that it’s behind in the AI arms race.\n\nBut that last hurdle may have already been cleared.\n\nAnalysts say that Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, has invested heavily enough in catching up to the industry’s first mover, Microsoft (MSFT), that its position may even be advantageous. Amazon’s ability to deploy its own chips within its data centers — at a fraction of the cost of relying on Nvidia’s — is the key.\n\nAmazon, some analysts contend, has a leg up on its competitors on two fronts: first, over Microsoft, which was hit with a rare downgrade earlier this week for leaning too heavily on Nvidia's (NVDA) AI infrastructure. Or as Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance, “Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.” Andy Jassy on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on Nov. 30, 2022, in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) (Thos Robinson via Getty Images)\n\nJassy also seems to have an answer to recent grumblings over returns on investment as tech giants dedicate tens of billions of dollars to AI capital expenditures. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\n\nOf course, it’s still too early to say if something like “AI chip sovereignty,” the fancy word for vertical integration, will be a key factor in monetizing AI tools or if unseating Nvidia in the battle over chips will be all that useful. Amazon is taking a more “all are welcome” marketplace approach to large language models, offering customers an array of advanced models to choose from instead of peddling a single proprietary offering.\n\nSome on Wall Street see another short-term advantage over a different rival: Google. Pinched by the potential threat of ChatGPT disrupting a search-based business model, as well as ramped-up antitrust enforcement over search practices, Google carries near-term risks that make Amazon look more attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's stock is up close to 30% this year. Among its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" only Nvidia's staggering rise and Meta's (META) turnaround have outperformed.\n\nThe company is reportedly unveiling a new Alexa with AI as early as next month. Another positive jolt to Amazon's AI story might be the most powerful cultural shift there is.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "2 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "Semiconductors are essential to modern technology, and the pandemic helped to accelerate its adoption by pushing many individuals and corporations to digitize. This surge in demand for microchips has continued post-pandemic.\n\nThe introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI), along with the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and autonomous vehicles, have all contributed to the continued progress of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe good news is that you can share in the spoils of this rapid growth. The semiconductor sector includes solid growth companies that are seeing their revenue and profits soar. By parking some of your money in these stocks, your portfolio can enjoy stellar capital gains over time. These businesses should have a dominant market share and a business model that can help them capture sustainable growth.\n\nHere are two attractive semiconductor stocks whose share prices could soar in the coming years. Image source: Getty images.\n\n1. Synopsys\n\nSynopsys(NASDAQ: SNPS) is the market leader in designing and testing complex chips, as well as the models and processes for companies to manufacture these chips. With silicon chips becoming more advanced due to the progress of IoT, AI, and 5G, Synopsys' services are in great demand. Foundries need guidance on the complexities of these designs to effectively produce these chips.\n\nThe company has demonstrated steady growth, with revenue rising from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2021 (ended Oct. 31) to $5.8 billion in fiscal 2023. Net income climbed from $757.5 million to $1.2 billion over the same period. The business also generated an average positive free cash flow of $1.5 billion over these three fiscal years.\n\nThis strong performance has continued into the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Revenue rose 16.6% year over year to $4.5 billion, and operating income climbed 23% to $1 billion. Net income was 30% higher than the prior year at $1.1 billion, and the company had positive free cash flow of $725.4 million.\n\nManagement is predicting strong momentum and expects full fiscal 2024 revenue to increase by 15% year over year to a new record. The company's long-term objectives include double-digit revenue growth, free cash flow margins in the mid-30% range, and earnings per share in the mid-teens.\n\nSassine Ghazi, who was named CEO in January this year, said that design cycles are shortening while chip complexity is increasing, both of which are positive signs for Synopsys. AI is driving demand for high-performance computing in data centers, smartphones, and personal computers. The innovation that comes with evolving AI needs will require more-complex chipsets, which should drive higher business volumes for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nSynopsys acquired Ansys in January for around $35 billion to help increase its portfolio of products and technologies, making it complementary to its business.\n\nWith this purchase, Synopsys expects to see its total addressable market increasing by 50% to around $28 billion, which will grow at roughly 11% per annum, creating significant business opportunities for the combined company.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a market leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) with a market share of around 88% in 2024. GPUs are ideal for powering AI, machine learning, and other uses.\n\nNvidia has grown at breakneck speed over the last three fiscal years, and management believes this is just the tip of the iceberg. Revenue more than doubled from $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022 (ending Jan. 31) to $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024. Net income tripled over the period to $29.8 billion from $9.8 billion.\n\nFree cash flow rose from $8.1 billion in fiscal 2022 to $27 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2025, this strong momentum continued. Revenue more than doubled year over year to $56.1 billion while net income leaped from $8.2 billion in the previous year to $31.5 billion. Free cash flow for the first half of fiscal 2025 was $28.5 billion, already exceeding the total for the whole of fiscal 2024. The company also pays a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang said that demand remains very strong as data centers seek to upgrade for accelerated computing and generative AI.\n\nNvidia's next-generation GPU, the Blackwell, failed to ship in the second quarter of calendar 2024 because of a manufacturing defect, causing widespread grief for many customers, which were relying on the new GPU to power their AI requirements.\n\nBut Huang assured buyers that Blackwell chips are now in full production and will start being shipped in the fourth quarter of this calendar year.\n\nA bright outlook for semiconductor sales\n\nSemiconductor sales experienced a cyclical year-over-year decline in 2023 because of the surge in pent-up demand for electronic products during the pandemic. The Semiconductor Industry Association announced that global sales fell by 8.2% year over year to $526.8 billion after falling from their 2022 peak.\n\nHowever, there are strong indicators that 2024 and 2025 will see a sharp rebound and continued growth for the industry. World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, a group that tracks the industry, forecasts that global semiconductor sales will grow 16% year over year for 2024, followed by a 12.5% year-over-year rise in 2025 to hit $687 billion.\n\nSEMI, representing more than 300 businesses in the industry, predicts 3.4% year-over-year growth for global sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to $109 billion for this year, followed by 17% year-over-year expansion to $128 billion for 2025.\n\nThese projections bode well for Synopsys and Nvidia, and both companies should see firm demand for their products and services.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This 1 Thing Will Help Nvidia Stock Soar in the Fourth Quarter",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have roared higher over the past several years, thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market -- it holds a more than 80% share. But recently, the stock has lost some of its momentum, falling more than 6% over the past month. Some investors have worried about growing competition in the chip market, and others fear that any slowdown in AI spending could hurt the company.\n\nIn my opinion, these concerns are overdone and Nvidia still has plenty of fuel in the tank to climb both in the near term and over time. My prediction is that one thing, in particular, will help Nvidia stock soar in the fourth quarter and the recent loss of momentum is only temporary. Let's dive into this tech story that still has plenty of exciting chapters ahead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's path from gaming to AI\n\nJust a few years ago, this technology giant's biggest source of revenue was the gaming industry. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) powered all of the action, due to their ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It soon became clear that this profile made the GPU perfect for other uses, including AI.\n\nNvidia turned its attention to this high-growth field, and its earnings took off, climbing in the triple digits quarter after quarter. Today, Nvidia's data center business -- the one that serves AI customers -- represents 87% of the company's total quarterly revenue. That's set to continue, considering the massive demand Nvidia's seeing and the general growth forecasts for the AI market, which is expected to expand from $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nOf course, competitors do exist, but Nvidia is a step ahead when it comes to innovation. It also plans to update its GPUs on an annual basis, which should keep it in this top position. As for AI spending, my colleague Trevor Jennewine recently wrote about how spending on AI may gain more momentum over the coming years, representing great news for Nvidia.\n\nNow let's move on to my prediction. Yes, Nvidia shares have delivered a lackluster performance in recent weeks, but it's important to put that into perspective. The stock still has advanced 144% so far this year and has soared 2,700% over the past five years.\n\n\"Several billion dollars\" of new revenue\n\nMy prediction is that this is a pause in the action, and in the fourth quarter, sales of Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture will help the stock roar higher. Nvidia said during its most recent earnings call that it plans to ramp up production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter and will record \"several billion dollars\" of revenue from it during that period.\n\nNvidia won't report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings until early next year, but any communications from the company about the Blackwell release or talk in the market could happen much earlier -- and investors are known to react to any news. All of this may equal strong performance for Nvidia shares in the fourth quarter of this year as investors consider the company's message during the last earnings call -- and look ahead to Blackwell's contribution to the next fourth-quarter report.\n\nIt's important to remember that Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang said demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply, and he expects this to continue into the coming year, so it's clear that customers are rushing to get in on this new platform. I recently wrote about how two major technology players begged Huang for more GPUs, further illustrating how eager customers are to get Nvidia chips.\n\nAll this makes me confident about Nvidia's long-term revenue potential in the AI market and the potential for its shares to soar over time, as well -- whether my near-term prediction is right or not. That means Nvidia still is a great stock to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The global economy is settling into a newfound stability and central banks can continue to cautiously cut rates, said the OECD yesterday, but warned that the major central banks should maintain their data-dependent approach and be ‘prudent’ while cutting their rates. We are all looking at you, Jerome Powell!\n\nAnyway, one thing that stood out in that report was the group’s projections for the UK. The OECD said that the UK economy will grow more this year and next year than previously forecasted and print the best performance among the group of G7 economies, after the US, and that despite a sticky inflation.\n\nThe UK’s sticky inflation is one more reason to believe that the Bank of England (BoE) will keep the pace of its rate cuts slower than its major peers. Both improved prospects and a cautious BoE stance are supportive of the pound sterling. Cable traded past the 1.34 yesterday, at the highest levels since spring 2022, and the EUR/GBP trends understandably lower with the diverging fortunes and outlook for the UK and the European economies – especially with Germany that’s under pressure and that ‘must carry out reforms’ according to the OECD.\n\nThe only thing that could get on the way of the sterling bulls is the upcoming Autumn Budget which could pour some cold water on enthusiasm that the new Labour leadership will strengthen the back of the UK’s shattered economy post-Brexit, pandemic, and energy crisis. The government needs money to boost spending and growth, but the finances are not in good shape.\n\nOil Bulls Nowhere to Be Found\n\nThe upbeat outlook from the OECD, the rising tensions in the Middle East, the 4.5-mio barrel dive in US oil inventories last week (that pushed the US oil inventories to the lowest levels in 2.5 years) and the big stimulus measures from China did little to cheer oil investors up.\n\nUS crude slipped below the $70pb again and remains under visible selling pressure this morning. Investors continue to trim their net speculative long positions in crude despite price-supportive factors. The inability to pull out the $70/72pb offers this week increases the chances of a fresh attempt on the $65pb level in the coming weeks.\n\nUS GDP in Focus\n\nStock markets weren’t in a particularly bullish mood yesterday. Investors preferred moving to the sidelines and leave the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hang near their ATH levels before today’s GDP print from the US and tomorrow’s core PCE read. The US economy is expected to have grown by 3% in Q2 – and Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow Forecast now suggests that growth may have remained robust near that level in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nA robust growth data is good for those who bet that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will achieve the soft landing that it dreams of. But it will also make investors think twice about their expectations for the next Fed meetings. Activity on Fed funds futures currently assesses more than a 60% chance for a second 50bp cut from the Fed in November and there is nothing – in the economic data – that would justify such a move besides greed.\n\nTherefore, a sufficiently strong GDP read has the potential to bring the bulls back to the market and send the US stock markets to fresh highs, but too much strength in the economic data should – at some point – encourage a scaling back of the Fed expectations and lead to consolidation and maybe – but just maybe – a minor downside correction in the stock markets.\n\nBut for now, the bulls have undeniably a stronger grip on the market. Nasdaq futures are up this morning on the back of surprisingly strong sales and profit forecasts from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) thanks to AI demand. Shares surged nearly 15% in the after-hours trading, and the post-earnings rally should help Micron return above its 200-DMA and eventually secure a floor near the $100 per share.\n\nZooming out, the AI fatigue gives signs of dissipating, as the Fed boost gives AI stocks fresh room to breathe, as part of a broader boost to risk appetite. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) extends gains with joy above the 50-DMA, while VanEck's Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) held ground near its 200-DMA and is drilling above its 100-DMA this week.\n\nDollar’s Misfortune\n\nThe US dollar rebounded yesterday against most majors, but the outlook remains negative for the greenback as the Fed’s major peers keep a cautious dovish bias as inflation eases, without however feeling the urge to boost their economies before making sure that inflation goes into a deeper sleep.\n\nThe EUR/USD retreated after testing levels above the 1.12 resistance. The USD/JPY is flirting with the 145 level, and the USD/CHF consolidated a touch below the 0.85 level before the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decision this morning. The SNB will probably cut its rates by 25bp.\n\nBut the latter will hardly encourage the franc bulls to reverse course. The USD/CHF is expected to consolidate and see a minor rebound in the short run with the expectation that the market and the Fed will come back to their senses regarding their overly dovish policy outlook, but in fine, the broadly negative dollar outlook – which is also due to the exploding US debt – is expected to keep the franc, other majors and gold well supported against the greenback.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhere Are the Oil Bulls?\n\nWatch the Long Bonds for Any Signs of Risk-Off Sentiment\n\n2 Ways Deflation of the â€˜Everything Bubbleâ€™ Can Play Out\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Five Reasons to Stay Bullish on Nvidia Stock (NVDA) After Recent Corrections",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) ultra-bullish trend in the first half of the year has paused, with the stock failing to reach new peaks over the past few months. Following the highly anticipated Q2 earnings report at the end of August, Nvidia stock experienced a pullback due to elevated investor expectations for hypergrowth, despite the strong results it posted. I believe this price correction offers a compelling opportunity. In this article, I will outline five reasons for my bullish view on Nvidia, focusing on strong revenue growth (despite tough comps), AI dominance, valuation, technical indicators, and Wall Street analyst consensus.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n1. Nvidia’s Strong Revenue Growth Despite Tough Comparisons\n\nThe first point supporting a prolonged bullish thesis for Nvidia is the solid revenue growth demonstrated in its Q2 results, despite challenging comparisons.\n\nNvidia posted 122% year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter, reaching revenues of $30 billion—a remarkable achievement given the company’s already substantial revenue base. Although this growth rate is lower than the 200% surge from the previous quarter, the absolute triple-digit top-line growth remains impressive. This underscores Nvidia’s ability to scale its revenue significantly even when set against it’s prior performance.\n\nWhile the post-Q2 stock pullback can be attributed to expectations being set too high, it’s crucial to note that Nvidia continues to deliver sequential quarterly revenue growth, signaling robust demand for its products, especially in AI and data centers. This level of sustained growth at such a large scale highlights Nvidia’s capacity to capture market share and drive long-term revenue expansion. Nvidia’s Q3 sales guidance of $32.5 billion further reflects the company’s confidence in maintaining its growth trajectory.\n\n2. Nvidia’s Dominance in AI and Data Center Market\n\nThe second bullish point is Nvidia’s continued dominance in the data center GPU space, where it holds a 98% market share in this rapidly growing sector, according to HPCwire.\n\nDemand for AI-driven solutions is booming across industries, with Nvidia’s H100 Hopper GPU becoming crucial for enterprise cloud applications that require massive computing power. Beyond hardware, Nvidia dominates AI through its software ecosystem, including CUDA and cuDNN, offering a comprehensive AI solution. As highlighted in Nvidia’s earnings call, the company aims to transform the $1 trillion data center market by shifting from traditional to accelerated computing using advanced data processing libraries.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia plans to launch its Blackwell architecture in Q4 of Fiscal 2025, offering greater power and efficiency than Hopper. Designed to meet the demands of hyperscalers and AI developers, Blackwell will provide comprehensive solutions, including chips, systems, networking, and software. This release is a key catalyst that will further solidify Nvidia’s leadership in AI.\n\n3. Nvidia Appears Attractively Priced When Adjusted for Growth\n\nThe third point concerns Nvidia’s valuations. At first glance, its P/E ratio of 54.7x and forward P/E of 42.5x may seem high, especially compared to the semiconductor industry average of 23.7x. However, my bullish stance is strengthened by Nvidia’s growth prospects, with the company expected to achieve 106% revenue growth and 119% EPS growth this year.\n\nFurthermore, analysts expect Nvidia’s EPS to grow at a CAGR of 36.6% over the next three to five years. This impressive growth rate, combined with the current forward P/E, results in a reasonable forward price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.16.\n\nTraditionally, undervalued stocks have a PEG ratio below one, yet NVIDIA’s PEG ratio is more favorable than those of all other Magnificent 7 stocks. Among this group, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta (META) have the next lowest PEG ratios at 1.28 and 1.48, respectively. While this doesn’t necessarily mean NVIDIA is undervalued compared to its Big Tech peers, it does suggest that, according to this metric, the stock doesn’t appear overly expensive.\n\n4. NVDA’s Moving Averages Suggest a Bullish Trend\n\nThe fourth point reinforcing the bullish thesis is closely tied to the sentiment surrounding Nvidia’s stock performance. Despite recent fluctuations, the company’s triple-digit revenue growth indicates that it is still in a hypergrowth phase. However, with a staggering 2,700% stock price surge over the past five years, concerns about a potential bubble remain.\n\nIn this context, I believe that focusing on long-term moving averages is essential for gauging momentum. This provides a clearer view of Nvidia’s trend amid daily volatility, especially given the stock’s 48% annualized volatility. NVDA stock’s upward trend is supported by a current trading price above its 200-day moving average of $92.80.\n\n5. Wall Street Remains Overwhelmingly Bullish on NVDA\n\nFinally, the fifth point contributing to my favorable outlook for Nvidia is the overwhelmingly bullish consensus among Wall Street analysts. Of the 42 analysts covering the stock, 39 have issued Buy recommendations, while the remaining three have a Hold rating. Moreover, the average price target among these analysts is $152.44, indicating potential upside of nearly 25%.\n\nA standout is Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann, who has the highest price target on Wall Street for Nvidia at $200 per share. His optimism persisted after the Q2 results, which he deemed strong, driven by growth in Hopper AI and networking. Although gross margins dipped slightly due to updates on Blackwell chips aimed at improving yields, Mosesmann remains confident. He highlights that despite potential short-term weakness in the share price, the bullish sentiment is supported by a 44x P/E multiple based on Fiscal 2027 EPS.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, I’ve outlined five key points supporting my Buy stance on Nvidia. I believe that the stock’s recent weakness presents an attractive buying opportunity for investors eager to capitalize on its strong growth trajectory.\n\nWhile some short-term hiccups may persist, Nvidia’s Q2 results suggest that its growth story is set to continue robustly as the company consolidates its market dominance and prepares for the upcoming release of the Blackwell architecture. Given the potential for further growth in the coming years, the current rich valuation can be justified, and Wall Street believes the same.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman focus on value, and others like Ken Fisher focus on growth, Asness’ fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\n\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock’s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock’s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock’s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\n\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital’s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\n\nThese returns ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\n\nLooking at the returns for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are plotted over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\n\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund’s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return’s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022 according to Bloomberg,\n\nAQR’s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey’s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund’s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as Citadel Wellington, Point72, and Millennium 5.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\n\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness’ top stock picks, it’s also important to see how his firms’ funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed’s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% – 3.50% by 2025 end.\n\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR’s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index’s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark’s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks “considered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe” has been the way to go so far in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital’s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey’s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179AQR Funds’ Latest Investment Stake: $1.92 billion NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s leading GPU designer. Its chips are the top performers in the industry when it comes to computing AI workloads and enabling accelerated computing. This has enabled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to transform itself from a firm that sold gaming GPUs to an enterprise and data center products provider. Subsequently, its hypothesis rests on the accelerated computing and AI associated demand for its GPUs and the ability to keep costs low. A slowdown on any of these fronts could see investors reevaluate their views on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and price out the future revenue growth estimates that have propelled the stock to a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys considerable design advantages, it can continue to be the primary industry GPU supplier for the future. However, large firms like Meta and Google might increase the presence of their own chips in infrastructure to create headwinds. Additionally, a lack of industry AI adoption could spell trouble. Baron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has effectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year. Moreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list. While we acknowledge NVDA's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Breaking down Intel’s wild week",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in its 56-year history. Declining sales, missed opportunities to compete in the AI space, and a massive turnaround effort by CEO Pat Gelsinger looking to return the company to its former glory are putting significant pressure on the chip giant’s bottom line and share price.\n\nAnd things for the company are only getting more interesting.\n\nLast Monday, Intel announced that it signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services, a positive sign for the company’s nascent third-party foundry business.\n\nThen, on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm (QCOM) reached out to Intel about a blockbuster takeover deal that would give Qualcomm a larger foothold in the PC and AI spaces. That’s not all. On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel to keep Gelsinger’s turnaround moving forward. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\nIt’s a lot to follow and even more to make any sense of. Luckily, I’m here to help break it all down for you.\n\nIntel’s slowing sales and AI troubles\n\nIntel is dealing with sliding sales and the unenviable position of having to take on market leader Nvidia in the AI space. For 2023, Intel reported full-year revenue of $54.2 billion, a 14% year-over-year decline from the $63.1 billion the company saw in 2022.\n\nThat included an 8% decline in Intel’s Client Computing Group, which sells chips for PCs; a 20% drop in Data Center and AI revenue; and a 31% decrease in Network and Edge sales. Intel did, however, report a 103% increase in its Intel Foundry Services, but that amounted to just $952 million. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger delivers a speech at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nPart of Intel’s woes have stemmed from the fact that the explosion in PC sales at the onset of the pandemic pulled Client Computing Group revenue forward several quarters, creating a boom and bust. Consumers bought new computers in droves for work and play, sending chip revenue soaring. But millions of consumers don’t usually buy new PCs at the same time. With so many people holding new computers, there were fewer consumers looking for upgrades, and sales entered an extended slump that sent shipments plummeting for eight consecutive quarters.\n\nSales are picking up again, though. In July, IDC said the PC market grew 3% in the second quarter, notching a second consecutive quarter of growth. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\nAt the same time, Intel is facing a new threat from Qualcomm, which began offering its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips in Windows PCs earlier this year as an alternative to Intel’s processors. Those chips provide improved performance and power versus Intel’s older offerings and are meant to compete with Apple’s (AAPL) exceptional M family of chips that power its MacBooks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is fighting back, though. Earlier this month, the company showed off its Core Ultra 200V line of processors that it says can outpace Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nFlagging PC sales also impacted graphics giant Nvidia (NVDA), which saw sales of its video game graphics chips deteriorate after the pandemic boom. But the company, unlike Intel, has managed to exploit its early investments in AI to take advantage of the surge in interest caused by the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThat helped catapult Nvidia to the forefront of the semiconductor industry and sent its stock to extraordinary new heights, rising more than 860% over the last two years and 191% in the last 12 months.\n\nIntel is working to try to catch Nvidia with its own Gaudi line of AI accelerators. On Tuesday, the company debuted its latest Gaudi 3 AI accelerator and announced that IBM will use it as part of its IBM Cloud offering.\n\nBut with Gartner estimating that Nvidia controls more than 70% of AI chip sales, it’s an uphill battle.\n\nIntel’s foundry services\n\nIntel is also battling for position as a chip manufacturer for third-party clients. The plan is for the company’s foundry business to operate as a subsidiary of Intel that builds processors for customers looking for an alternative to TSMC, which is among the world’s largest chipmakers\n\nBut the buildout is costly and Wall Street isn’t completely sold on the idea. Analysts at Citi Research have said Intel should exit the foundry business altogether so that it can improve margins and earnings per share.\n\nIn September, however, Intel announced a multibillion-dollar deal to \"produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced process node.\" The company is also set to build a custom version of its Xeon 6 chip for Amazon.\n\nThe news comes after Intel announced that Microsoft signed on as a manufacturing customer in February. Two big-name companies are certainly a start for Intel, but it’s going to need to sign a slew of customers if it hopes to grow its manufacturing segment to match competing chip fabricators.\n\nQualcomm and Apollo\n\nIntel’s PC and AI woes have left it as a potential takeover target, which is where Qualcomm and Apollo enter the mix. Qualcomm, according to the Wall Street Journal, wants to buy up Intel, though it’s unclear if the company would hold on to all of Intel or sell portions of its business segments. The deal is also sure to generate plenty of antitrust concerns, as the companies are two of the most important chip firms in the US.\n\nApollo, meanwhile, looks to favor Gelsinger’s plans and could invest up to $5 billion in Intel to follow through with the effort, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNow investors will have to wait and see whether Intel moves forward with either company or continues to try to go it alone.

        "title": "NVIDIA &amp; 2 Other S&amp;P 500 Stocks Show Strong Earnings Growth",
        "content": "While market participants see the S&P 500 at 6,000 by the year-end, a lot depends on how the stocks perform in the third-quarter earnings season. This is because earnings are the most vital variable influencing the share price.\n\nFor the third quarter, total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are projected to improve 3.4% from a year ago on 4.5% higher revenues. Hence, it is important to keep an eye on stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK listed on the S&P 500 index, which are currently exhibiting superb earnings growth.\n\nEarnings Estimates & Share Price Movements\n\nFrequently, we have seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely the result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.\n\nEarnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins, and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool, while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.\n\nThus, investors should watch for stocks set to surge. Investors need to buy stocks with historical earnings growth and witnessing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.\n\nWe use that basis to determine our stock selections using Zack’s Research Wizard Tool.\n\nScreening Measures Using Research Wizard:\n\nTo shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 3 (Only Zacks’ ‘Strong Buys’, ‘Buys’, and ‘Holds’ are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)\n\n5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (stocks with a strong EPS growth history).\n\n% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (companies that saw year-over-year earnings growth of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal).\n\n% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week).\n\n% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe above criteria narrowed the universe of around 7,839 stocks to only 12. Here are the top three stocks:\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA is the global leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 116.2%. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (read more: Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?).\n\nBoston Scientific\n\nBoston Scientific manufactures medical devices and products used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide. BSX’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 17.1%. BSX currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAmerican Water Works\n\nAmerican Water Works is a water supply and wastewater service provider. AWK’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.6%. AWK currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nYou can sign up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "Micron stock jumps as Q1 revenue forecast tops analyst estimates",
        "content": "Micron (MU) stock surged 13% after the bell Wednesday after the chipmaker forecast higher-than-expected first quarter revenue.\n\nMicron projected revenue of $8.5 billion to $8.9 billion for the quarter, above the $8.3 billion analysts anticipated.\n\n“We are entering fiscal 2025 with the best competitive positioning in Micron's history,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement. \"We forecast record revenue in fiscal Q1 and a substantial revenue record with significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025.”\n\nMicron is the first chipmaker to report quarterly results this earnings season. Its report provides an initial look at how the semiconductor sector is faring amid high expectations from Wall Street.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $7.75 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Aug. 29 — 93% higher than last year and surpassing the $7.66 billion expected by analysts, who had recently softened their expectations. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 also exceeded both the top range of Micron's guidance and the $1.11 forecasted by Wall Street.\n\nMicron’s memory chip business has undergone a resurgence over the past year as Big Tech firms pour billions into the semiconductor sector for hardware to power artificial intelligence data centers.\n\nMicron distinguishes itself by partnering with, rather than competing against, industry superpower Nvidia (NVDA). Micron supplies memory chips for Nvidia’s hotly demanded GPUs. The Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant in Manassas, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInvestors have staggeringly high and ever-increasing standards for AI chipmakers, which has left them often disappointed in recent months. Micron’s third quarter earnings beat did little to sway investors in late June, and shares plummeted due to its fourth quarter outlook, which came right in line with (rather than beating) Wall Street’s expectations. Nvidia stock also sank after reporting quarterly earnings at the end of August. Despite more than doubling profits and beating sales forecasts, investors wanted more from the semiconductor superpower.\n\nNvidia stock has since rebounded, and Micron's fourth quarter results lifted its stock after an otherwise disappointing few months, which have seen its stock price plummet from highs in the $150 range in mid-June.\n\nThe PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (^SOX) has begun to recover from a dip at the beginning of the month as tech stocks rallied following the US Federal Reserve’s jumbo interest rate cut and the Chinese central bank’s broad stimulus package. The index is up nearly 6% over the last week.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ever since shares of Nvidia (NVDA) reached an all-time high in June, the chipmaker’s stock has experiencedsometurbulence — but its market cap is still up over 150% so far this year.\n\nNvidia’s shares were up 2.37% during mid-day trading Monday at $123.73 per share — down around 9% from its record-high close price of $135.58 on June 18, days after it initiated a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nStill, the chipmaker’s shares have climbed around 156.86% so far this year, boosting its market cap just above $3 trillion and making it the third-most valuable company in the world. Compared with a year ago, Nvidia’s stock is up over 190%.\n\nThe company has been one of the biggest winners of the generative artificial intelligence boom due to high demand for its Hopper graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used for training and inferencing of some of the world’s most powerful AI models. Meanwhile, samples of Nvidia’s latest AI platform, Blackwell, are shipping to customers, and the product is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter into fiscal year 2026. In August, reports that Blackwell was delayed due to design flaws sent Nvidia’s shares down.\n\nIn June, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in total market cap and crossed the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. Just weeks later, it overtook both Apple and Microsoft to become the world’s most valuable public company. Despite falling back into third place, Nvidia remains the most valuable semiconductor company in the world. In February, it became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after reporting record fourth-quarter earnings.\n\nHowever, despite reporting another record quarter that beat Wall Street’s expectations, Nvidia’s shares slipped in August, reflecting unimpressed investors who want more from the chipmaker.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably one of the best companies in the tech sector, with a market capitalization of approximately $2.85 trillion. The company has been in the limelight for years, remaining an investor favorite. Shares of NVDA have risen by over 175% over the past year, propelling the wealth of its co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who holds a 3% stake. Today, Huang has over $101 billion net worth, making him the 15th richest man in the world.\n\nThe origins of NVIDIA are as fascinating as its ascent to market leader. Huang, a Stanford University graduate, used to work as a dishwasher at Denny's and clean toilets to earn a living as a teenager.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\n\"I mean, I cleaned a lot of toilets,\" Huang said in an interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, \"I've cleaned more toilets than all of you combined – and some of them you just can't unsee.\"\n\nDespite becoming one of the most influential men in tech, Huang isn't afraid to get his hands dirty.\n\n\"To me, no task is beneath me because, remember, I used to be a dishwasher [and] I used to clean toilets,\" Huang said.\n\nIncorporating NVIDIA Over Breakfast\n\nThe idea for NVIDIA came about when Huang met Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem at a Denny's in San Francisco in 1993 while he was working for Advanced Micro Devices.\n\n\"We came right here to this Denny's, sat right back there, and the three of us decided to start the company,\" Huang reminisced during an interview with CBS' 60 minutes, \"Frankly, I had no idea how to do it, nor did they. None of us knew how to do anything.\"\n\nSince then, Huang has successfully steered NVIDIA to become the largest chip manufacturer pandering to the artificial intelligence markets. Today, according to estimates published by Mizuho Securities, NVIDIA controls between 70% and 95% of the global market for AI chips used for training and deploying generative AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThe Journey to a Trillion-Dollar Company\n\nHowever, this journey hasn't been easy. Just two years after its inception in 1995, NVIDIA was on the verge of bankruptcy when its low-cost processing chip was rendered \"technically poor\" for graphics. At the time, Huang got a financial lifeline from video gaming company Sega, which gave them funds to stay afloat for six months.\n\n\"At Nvidia, I [have] experienced failures. Great big ones – all humiliating and embarrassing,\" Huang said during a commencement speech at National Taiwan University last year, adding, \"The CEO of Sega, to his credit and my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to live.\"\n\nDuring this time, NVIDIA launched the RIVA 128 chip – the company's first big hit, selling over a million units in just four months in 1997. This was just the starting point for the chip giant, which grew to become the second most valuable company in the world. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's revenues rose at a compound annual growth rate of 39.1%, while its earnings per share rose at a compounded rate of 47.9% per year since 2019.\n\n\"This is the most extraordinary thing,\" he said. \"That a normal dishwasher busboy could grow up to be this. There's no magic. It's just 61 years of hard work every single day. I don't think there's anything more than that.\"\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

Roger Altman, Evercore founder and senior chairman, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the Fed was not “behind the curve” but it went with a higher-than-expected rate cut amid labor market concerns.\n\nAsked if he thinks we are headed toward a soft landing scenario, Altman said yes, as he believes growth is “resilient” and corporate profit outlook is good. Altman said equity markets are headed to have their best year since 1960.\n\n“If the landing is finished and the Fed hits its target, Powell will deserve an A and it would be a pretty miraculous achievement,” Altman said.\n\nWhile the analyst believes currently it’s a “near perfect” overall environment for the market, he did point to “storm clouds” gathering over the international stage including the expanding crisis in the Middle East, Russia’s war on Ukraine and America’s overall fiscal situation.\n\nFor this article we chose 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Buzzing AI Stock on Latest News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nBarclays Tom O’Malley recently said in a note that spending on AI chips must rise to meet even modest expectations from large language model (LLM) developers. The analyst noted that the recent sell-off in AI chip stocks, especially after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings, has raised concerns about whether the market is nearing a peak. However, O’Malley emphasized that these fears overlook the significant compute needs required to power future AI models.\n\nBarclays identified three key takeaways for the semiconductor sector:\n\nFirst, the need for compute resources is expected to surge. For instance, by 2027, just three frontier models with 50 trillion parameters each could require around 20 million chips for training alone. The demand for compute is anticipated to outpace improvements in chip performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, a dual approach to AI accelerators is emerging. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD, and startups are expected to dominate in training and inference for frontier models, while hyperscale companies will rely on custom silicon for specialized tasks.\n\nThird, inference, where AI models apply learned knowledge, will play a significant role in monetizing frontier models. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) claims that 40% of its chips are already used for inference, with more providers focusing on this market to drive down costs and improve return on investment.\n\nO’Malley concluded that the AI chip industry is still in its early stages, and higher investments in compute resources are critical to meet future demands.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia’s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Robinhood Markets, Interactive Brokers, NVIDIA and BlackRock",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 25, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and BlackRock, Inc. BLK.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n4 Bitcoin-Centric Stocks to Gain from Recent Fed Rate Cut\n\nThe cryptocurrency rally that had stalled for some time has started showing signs of a solid rebound. Bitcoin (BTC), which surged above $60,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate cut announcement, was trading above $63,600 on Monday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve interest rate cut announced last week has been helping Bitcoin bounce back from its recent lows. Experts had predicted that Bitcoin still has a lot of potential and the recent decline was temporary. Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Bitcoin-centric stocks such as Robinhood Markets, Inc., Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and BlackRock, Inc..\n\nBitcoin Rebounds on Rate Cut Announcement\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin was trading at $63,658.52 after surpassing the $60,000 mark for the first time in more than a month ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate cut announcement.\n\nBitcoin's price declined substantially after hitting an all-time high of $73,750 on Mar 14. The cryptocurrency saw its price falling below $55,000 in early August after a broader market bloodbath on fears of a slowing economy.\n\nPrior to that, the halving event also failed to boost Bitcoin. The halving event, which usually reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by 50% to cap the total supply at 21 million, often leads to higher demand and prices.\n\nHowever, following the latest halving, Bitcoin's value saw a significant decline.\n\nRate Cuts to Boost Bitcoin\n\nThe rate cut was highly anticipated to boost Bitcoin and did so. Market participants had expected that the Federal Reserve would go for a 25-basis point rate cut. However, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in its bid to help boost the health of the broader economy.\n\nBitcoin has since been on a rally. Lower interest rates typically help growth assets like cryptocurrencies because it lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. In a low-interest-rate setting, investors are more likely to seek out assets with higher potential returns, even if they come with increased risk.\n\nAlso, the rate cut cycle has just begun. Market participants are hopeful about another 50 basis-point rate cut in total this year, which bodes well for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nStory continues\n\n4 Crypto-Centric Stocks With Scope for Upside\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nRobinhood Markets operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 38.2% over the past 60 days. Robinhood Markets currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group\n\nInteractive Brokers Group is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.5% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nBlackRock\n\nBlackRock is one of the world's largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 9.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the past 60 days.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 25, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights TeraWulf WULF, Core Scientific CORZ, Applied Digital APLD and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nThanks to AI/Bitcoin Data Centers, These Stocks Set to Boom\n\nAI: The Biggest Advance Since the Internet\n\nMost people forget that the internet was invented in 1983. However, it took until the late 1990s for the internet industry to go mainstream. Pivotal technological advancements, namely Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web invention, the development of web browsers, and the availability of high-speed internet, were pivotal advances that led to the internet age.\n\nSince gaining popularity in the late 1990s, the internet industry has repeatedly delivered stock market winners. Could artificial intelligence stocks provide similar true market leaders like the internet once did? According to the world's top technologists, the answer is a resounding \"Yes!\"\n\n\"AI will have more impact than the personal computer, the phone or the internet. It's the most exciting innovation of my lifetime.\"~ Bill Gates, co-founder, Microsoft\n\nBitcoin: The Top Performing Asset\n\nUnlike artificial intelligence, few saw the Bitcoin wave coming. Bitcoin started as a white paper in 2008 and was mainly used by internet nerds or for nefarious reasons like online drug transactions. However, the world's first and largest digital currency has defied many skeptics along the way and has transformed into the decade's top-performing asset class, accruing gains of more than 6,000%. Though Bitcoin's success has exceeded all expectations, its growth trajectory is still getting started.\n\nWhat Does Bitcoin Mining and Artificial Intelligence Have in Common?\n\nBitcoin mining and artificial intelligence share a fundamental technological requirement: massive parallel computing power. Bitcoin miners use this technology to solve cryptographic puzzles to mine Bitcoin, while AI companies leverage the technology to train their models. Below are three companies that benefit from these two megatrends:\n\n1. TeraWulf: Clean Energy Leader\n\nTeraWulf is an \"infrastructure-focused Bitcoin mining company accelerating the transition to a zero-carbon future.\" The company focuses on helping Bitcoin miners to mine Bitcoin using sustainable energy sources like nuclear, hydro, and solar energy. With massive data center construction underway for Bitcoin mining applications and AI, the need for clean energy is becoming abundantly clear.\n\nLast week, Microsoftannounced a massive deal with Constellation Energyto revive the closed Three Mile Island by 2028 to power its data centers with nuclear energy. MSFT is likely the first mover, but other tech companies will likely follow suit and WULF is set up perfectly to benefit. By the end of 2025, the company estimates its energy production capability will double.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Core Scientific: Bitcoin Mining Leader\n\nCore Scientific is one of the top digital asset miners and operates several data centers nationwide. CORZ derives most of its revenue from Bitcoin mining. Over the past three years, no other public company has mined more Bitcoin than CORZ.\n\n3. Applied Digital Will Benefit from Nvidia Deal\n\nApplied Digital is a \"designer, builder, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure designed for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications. Earlier this month, APLD shares soared 65% after the company announced a $160 million deal with Nvidia to bring its data center and GPU cloud solutions to scale. After digesting its recent gains, APLD shares are trying to break out of a multi-month base structure.\n\nBottom Line\n\nData centers, AI, and Bitcoin mining are three fast-growing businesses bound to be multi-year megatrends. CORZ, WULF, and APLD are three companies that should benefit for years.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 25, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Okta OKTA as the Bull of the Day and Aviat Networks AVNW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Vistra Corp.'s VST, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nOkta, a $13 billion provider of identity security solutions, is back to the upper realms of the Zacks Rank after EPS estimates turned back north this month.\n\nWhat's odd is that the stock price is still in the cellar after their late August earnings report saw shares drop over 17% on the day of, and then over -25% total to Sep 10.\n\nThe problem is that Wall Street is still nervous about the company's business outlook after they had to pay $60 million to settle a data breach from two years ago.\n\nAmong 34 analysts, the average price target is above $105 and the low PT is $75.\n\nAnd large institutions were big net buyers of OKTA shares in Q2.\n\nIt's almost as if everyone is waiting for more bad news as the stock sits here at $76.\n\nSo I bought some. I'm obviously looking for the \"contrarian upside\" to good news the stock is not being discounted for. Here's what I told my TAZR members yesterday...\n\nTAZR Traders\n\nPortfolio is buying Okta between $74 and $76.\n\nI just went over the numbers and outlook. Unless somebody knows that another internal OKTA security breach is going to drop, or they are losing customers because of the way they handled the last one, I think the stock is cheap relative to all cybersecurity peers.\n\nIt's back to a Zacks #1 Rank for a reason and I don't see the worry here at $13 billion, trading under 5X sales.\n\nIn the last few weeks since the company report, the Zacks consensus EPS estimate for this fiscal 2025 (ends in January) rose 7% from $2.40 to $2.57, representing a 29X P/E in an industry loaded with 90X P/Es.\n\n(end of TAZR Buy Alert excerpt)\n\nWhy I Think OKTA Has a Bright Future\n\nBesides that fact that the company specializes in \"identity security,\" in essence making sure that the person authorized for an IT function is the one being authenticated and monitored, they are also aggressively pursuing the edges of new AI threat vectors.\n\nYesterday, they rolled out an expansion of an existing service, Auth0, to attract more corporate clients as the threat landscape evolves. Traditional identity threats, bolstered by AI advances, are enabling low-quality, high-intensity attacks to become more dangerous and helping new, personalized attacks to emerge.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith bots making up nearly 50% of all internet traffic, developers are challenged with securing their applications in this landscape. Multi-factor authentication (MFA), with possession-based or biometric factors, remains as one of the most effective defenses.\n\nConversely, AI can also power bot detection, with AI helping Okta block 79% of automated login attempts and recently reduce bot traffic by 90% over a 90 day period.\n\nAuth0 Takes \"Free for Developers\" to a New Level with More Users, More Security, Free MFA & Passwordless\n\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 24, 2024-- Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA), the leading independent Identity partner, today announced that it's expanding the capabilities of Auth0 and the Okta Customer Identity Cloud to give developers more of the scalability, security, and customization they need. These enhancements start with the Auth0 Free Plan, including an increase to 25,000 monthly active users (MAUs), passwordless, unlimited* social & Okta connections, and custom domain support.\n\n\"Developers are grappling with greater demand to rapidly deploy applications while facing increasingly sophisticated AI-powered bot attacks to defend against,\" said Shiven Ramji, President, Customer Identity Cloud at Okta. \"To help them stay ahead of these threats and grow their businesses, developers require solutions that can take care of identity and security for them. By making more Auth0 capabilities available at no added cost, developers can build secure apps from the start and feel confident in their ability to scale alongside significant user growth.\"\n\nWhat I like about the OKTA approach here is the same thing that made me a dedicated NVIDIA investor many years ago: they give powerful tools to developers who can then build new solutions for their clients within that ecosystem.\n\nThe world of cybersecurity took a turn in this decade where the \"hackers\" are no longer in their pajamas in their parents' basement. Now they are well-funded and equipped by state enterprises from North Korea, Iran, and Russia.\n\nThat's why I wrote a special report last October titled \"State of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0\" where I detailed the new levels of sophistication, especially with AI applications.\n\nIf you want a copy of that report, just email Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you.\n\nBottom line: Ransomware costs are expected to soar at a 30% CAGR from $35B in 2023 to $220B by 2030. You don't have to buy OKTA, but you better own at least 3 cyber firms since the enterprises needing extensive protection usually employ 5+ of them to cover all bases.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nAmong the tech sector, one stock that could surprise investors in terms of more downside risk is Aviat Networks. While Aviat's growth and valuation may be attractive on the surface, the global supplier of wireless network solutions has been entrenched in scrutiny.\n\nConsidering such, it may be best to avoid Aviat's stock at the moment which lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.\n\nAviat is Losing Investor Confidence\n\nInvestor confidence in Aviat's stock has started to sour following legal investigations by multiple law firms. Earlier in the month, Aviat stated it wouldn't be able to timely file its annual report after identifying certain errors impacting previously reported financial information for its current fiscal 2024 and FY23.\n\nNews of such has caused Aviat's stock to plummet -17% in September. Furthermore, AVNW is now down more than -30% year to date to vastly underperform the broader indexes and its Zacks Wireless Equipment Market's +25%.\n\nNegative Zacks ESP\n\nOn top of mounting concerns in regard to accounting practices, the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) also indicates Aviat could miss its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations with the company scheduled to report on Wednesday, September 25.\n\nTo that point, the Most Accurate Estimate for Aviat's Q4 EPS is at $0.62 and -6% below the Zacks Consensus of $0.66 per share.\n\nDeclining EPS Revisions\n\nNotably, Aviat's Q4 earnings estimate revisions have declined -16% from estimates of $0.79 per share 30 days ago. In the last month annual earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 have declined -4% and -7% respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nUnfortunately, the old saying of when there is smoke there's fire may apply to Aviat's stock. Considering the wireless network provider is dealing with financial accounting probes, declining earnings estimate revisions is another tell-tale sign that it may be best to avoid Aviat's stock at the moment.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nVistra Surpasses NVIDIA as S&P 500's Top Stock in 2024: Buy Now?\n\nThis year, Vistra Corp.'s strong rally could potentially hinder NVIDIA Corp. from becoming the S&P 500's top annual performer back to back, a title held only by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. since 1999.\n\nHowever, Vistra's stupendous gains have made the stock pricey. So, let's look at how to trade the VST stock.\n\nVistra (Not NVIDIA) is the S&P 500's Top YTD Gainer\n\nWall Street darling NVIDIA squashed bubble fears and witnessed a meteoric rise this year with the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nShipment of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips by the end of the year and sheer dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market has given the magnificent 7 stock an edge over its peers.\n\nMost importantly, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve's major interest rate cuts. Lower interest rates don't affect NVIDIA's crucial cash flows for growth. Also, lower borrowing costs boost its profit margins (read more: Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?).\n\nAs a result, NVIDIA's shares have soared 134.8% this year and remained the S&P 500's top performer for quite some time. However, Vistra, a not-so-household name, toppled NVIDIA last week to become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, an index it joined not long ago.\n\nThe change in the top position took place as investors showed keen interest in an electric company rather than semiconductor stocks to play the boom in AI.\n\nVistra shares scaled upward for its nuclear power business and high demand from power-consuming AI data centers. Vistra is poised to capitalize on AI data center power needs with its exclusive gas and nuclear power plants mix.\n\nThe Vistra stock climbed 189.8% year to date, while its peers trailed, with the Utility - Electric Power industry soaring 17.2%.\n\nKey VST Stock Tailwinds\n\nIt's just not power requirements for data centers that are propelling Vistra shares upward. According to analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies, Vistra stands to gain from an increase in power prices, increased plant usage and likely contracts with data centers. Hence, the $4.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate for VST's earnings per share is up 8.9% year over year.\n\nVistra has also generated profits significantly, which boosted its share price. After all, the VST stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 21.1%, more than the industry's 10.4%. Any ROE above 20% is considered to be very strong.\n\nTime to Buy VST Stock?\n\nBanking on the AI boom, increase in wholesale power prices and potential to generate profits competently not only helped Vistra to be the top performer in the S&P 500 but also will boost its shares further. Anyhow, the VST stock is trading above the 200-day moving average this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\n\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of VST by 6.6% from the stock's last closing price of $107.88. The highest price target is at $133, an upside of 23.3%.\n\nThus, those who have invested in the VST stock should stick to it and capitalize on the strong price upside trend. But if you are thinking of buying the stock now, it may burn a hole in your pocket! This is because, per price/earnings, the VST stock, presently, trades at 23.3X forward earnings. However, the industry's forward earnings multiple is 17.4X. So, better wait for an opportune moment to invest in the VST stock.\n\nVistra currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\n\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\n\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, made a surprise appearance at the recently held T-Mobile Capital Markets Day. Speaking alongside T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert, Huang claimed that his company had fused signal processing and AI. He predicted that this was going to be a great new growth opportunity for the telecommunications industry.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has been one of the biggest drivers of stock market growth over the past couple of years. Shares of the technology companies best placed to make the most of the hot tech trend have soared, lifting the major indexes with them.\n\nThis explains why the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's gain of 75% in the past two years has outpaced the 54% rise in the S&P 500 index over the same period. That's the reason why buying and holding AI stocks for the long run could turn out to be a smart move, especially as the technology is in its early phases of adoption.\n\nMcKinsey, for instance, forecasts that generative AI has the potential to boost the global economy between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually. So, if you have $3,000 in investible cash right now after paying off your bills, settling any high-interest debt you're carrying, and making sure you have set aside enough in an emergency fund, you should consider investing that money in shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), or both.\n\nBoth companies have already delivered healthy gains to investors in the past year, based on their AI-related prospects, they are likely to deliver more upside in the long run.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has played a pioneering role in the growth of the AI trend. Its highest-end graphics processing units (GPUs) have been deployed by major cloud computing providers, tech companies, and governments to train large language models (LLMs). The company has been supplying between 80% and 95% of AI chips sold, and its recent results indicate that it is unlikely to lose its dominance in this lucrative market any time soon.\n\nNvidia is growing at a much faster pace than its rivals. Its revenue soared by 122% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to a record $30 billion, driven by a 154% increase in its data center revenue to $26.3 billion. That number far eclipsed the revenue that rival AMD is expecting to generate from selling AI GPUs for the entire year.\n\nNvidia's market share dominance means that it is in pole position to benefit the most from the growth of the AI chip market, which (according to a forecast from Next Move Strategy Consulting) is expected to generate $305 billion in annual revenue in 2030. Japanese investment banking firm Mizuho predicts Nvidia's revenue could hit $200 billion in calendar 2027 (which will run nearly parallel to its fiscal 2028). That would be more than triple the $61 billion revenue it generated in its fiscal 2024 (which coincided with the majority of calendar 2023).\n\nStory continues\n\nMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh says the robust demand for Nvidia's current generation Hopper chips and the arrival of its new Blackwell processors will be key catalysts for the company's data center business. Additionally, the company is looking to make its presence felt in the enterprise AI software market, and it's witnessing a rapid increase in its revenue from this segment.\n\nSpecifically, Nvidia expects to end the current fiscal year with a $2 billion annual revenue run rate in its software business, which would be twice its run rate at the end of the previous fiscal year. Mordor Intelligence forecasts that the enterprise AI market could clock an annualized growth rate of 52% through 2029, generating $311 billion in revenue that year.\n\nNvidia, therefore, is growing at a faster pace than this rapidly expanding market right now, and the opportunity present in enterprise AI means that it is capable of benefiting from AI adoption beyond just the hardware market. All this explains why buying this AI stock could turn out to be a smart long-term move.\n\nAfter all, a $3,000 investment made in Nvidia stock at the beginning of 2024 would already be worth more than $7,000 as of this writing. It could deliver more such performances over the long run as well.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nWhile Nvidia is primarily a play on the fast-growing demand for hardware capable of supporting the processing demands of AI, Palantir is a play on the growing business uses for AI software. Investors have already seen how fast the enterprise AI market is set to grow, and this is the reason why there has been an acceleration in Palantir's growth in recent quarters.\n\nThe company, which provides software platforms to both commercial and government customers, has been striking bigger deals and gaining more customers thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir's AIP helps organizations integrate generative AI into their operations, and the company has been aggressive with the roll-out of this platform. More specifically, Palantir hosts \"boot camps\" for potential clients where they focus on company-specific problems to show precisely how its generative AI can be used to make an operation more efficient.\n\nThese boot camps have been paying off. During its August earnings conference call,  Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue officer, noted:\n\nBoot camps remain a key go-to-market motion, particularly for prototyping what is possible with AI, but the real opportunity and our unique capability lies in moving from prototype to production with these customers. That is where we are focused. We closed a seven-figure deal with a large wholesale insurance brokerage firm for an initial production automated policy review use case just 16 days after the boot camp.\n\nPalantir also gave other examples where it has managed to convert boot camps into paid pilots or actual deals. All this explains why in Q2, the company's revenue growth accelerated to 27%, bringing the top line to $678 million, as compared to 21% year-over-year growth in Q1. The company's commercial revenue grew 33% to $307 million, while government revenue increased by 23% to $371 million.\n\nMore importantly, Palantir's customer count jumped by 41% year-over-year to 593 last quarter. This healthy growth in the company's customer base was accompanied by higher customer spending. Palantir closed 96 deals worth at least $1 million last quarter, up from 66 in the same quarter last year. Additionally, the number of deals worth more than $10 million increased by 50% year over year to 27.\n\nThis improving customer base and stronger deal activity have led analysts to increase their growth expectations for Palantir for 2024 and the next couple of years. PLTR EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above shows, Palantir is expected to generate almost $4 billion in revenue in 2026. However, it won't be surprising to see the company deliver even stronger growth considering its impressive revenue pipeline. Palantir's total remaining deal value shot up by 26% year over year in the second quarter to $4.3 billion. This metric refers to the total remaining value of contracts that Palantir has yet to fulfill, which means that the company is positioned to sustain healthy levels of growth that could help it outpace analysts' expectations.\n\nAs it turns out, Palantir is expected to clock annualized earnings growth of 85% over the next five years. So this AI stock looks likely to keep delivering healthy returns to investors. It is worth noting that Palantir stock has more than doubled so far in 2024, turning a $3,000 investment made in it at the beginning of the year into $6,500 as of this writing. It could repeat that feat in the long run, based on its huge addressable opportunity in the AI software market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can AI make video games more immersive? Some studios turn to AI-fueled NPCs for more interaction",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — For decades, video games have relied on scripted, stilted interactions with non-player characters to help shepherd gamers in their journeys. But as artificial intelligence technology improves, game studios are experimenting with generative AI to help build environments, assist game writers in crafting NPC dialogue and lend video games the improvisational spontaneity once reserved for table-top role-playing games.\n\nIn the multiplayer game “Retail Mage,” players help run a magical furniture store and assist customers in hopes of earning a five-star review. As a salesperson — and wizard — they can pick up and examine items or tell the system what they'd like to do with a product, such as deconstruct chairs for parts or tear a page from a book to write a note to a shopper.\n\nA player’s interactions with the shop and NPCs around them — from gameplay mechanics to content and dialogue creation — are fueled by AI rather than a predetermined script to create more options for chatting and using objects in the shop.\n\n“We believe generative AI can unlock a new kind of gameplay where the world is more responsive and more able to meet players at their creativity and the things that they come up with and the stories they want to tell inside a fantasy setting that we create for them,” said Michael Yichao, cofounder of Jam & Tea Studios, which created “Retail Mage.”\n\nThe typical NPC experience often leaves something to be desired. Pre-scripted interactions with someone meant to pass along a quest typically come with a handful of chatting options that lead to the same conclusion: players get the information they need and continue on. Game developers and AI companies say that by using generative AI tech, they aim to create a richer experience that allows for more nuanced relationships with the people and worlds that designers build.\n\nGenerative AI could also provide more opportunities for players to go off-script and create their own stories if designers can craft environments that feel more alive and can react to players' choices in real-time.\n\nTech companies continue to develop AI for games, even as developers debate how, and whether, they’ll use AI in their products. Nvidia created its ACE technologies to bring so-called “digital humans” to life with generative AI. Inworld AI provides developers with a platform for generative NPC behavior and dialogue. Gaming company Ubisoft said last year that it uses Ghostwriter, an in-house AI tool, to help write some NPC dialogue without replacing the video game writer.\n\nStory continues\n\nA report released by the Game Developers Conference in January found that nearly half of developers surveyed said generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31% saying they personally use those tools. Developers at indie studios were most likely to use generative AI, with 37% reporting use the tech.\n\nStill, roughly four out of five developers said they worry about the ethical use of AI. Carl Kwoh, Jam & Tea's CEO, said AI should be used responsibly alongside creators to elevate stories — not to replace them.\n\n“That’s always been the goal: How can we use this tool to create an experience that makes players more connected to each other?” said Kwoh, who is also one of the company’s founders. “They can tell stories that they couldn’t tell before.”\n\nUsing AI to provide NPCs with endless things to say is “definitely a perk,” Yichao said, but \"content without meaning is just endless noise.\" That's why Jam & Tea uses AI — through Google's Gemma 2 and their own servers in Amazon — to give NPCs the ability to do more than respond, he said. They can look for objects as they’re shopping or respond to other NPCs to add “more life and reactivity than a typically scripted encounter.”\n\n“I’ve watched players turn our shopping experience into a bit of a dating sim as they flirt with customers and then NPCs come up with very realistic responses,” he said. “It’s been really fun to see the game react dynamically to what players bring to the table.”\n\nDemonstrating a conversation with a NPC in the game “Mecha BREAK,” in which players battle war machines, Ike Nnole said that Nvidia has made its AI “humans” respond faster than they previously could by using small language models. Using Nvidia's AI, players can interact with the mechanic, Martel, by asking her to do things like customize the color of a mech machine.\n\n“Typically, a gamer would go through menus to do all this,” Nnole, a senior product marketing manager at Nvidia said. “Now it could be a much more interactive, much quicker experience.”\n\nArtificial Agency, a Canadian AI company, built an engine that allows developers to bring AI into any part of their game — not only NPCs, but also companions and “overseer agents” that can steer a player towards content they’re missing. The AI can also create tutorials to teach players a skill that they are missing so they can have more fun in-game, the company said.\n\n“One way we like to put it is putting a game designer on the shoulder of everyone as they’re playing the game,” said Alex Kearney, cofounder of Artificial Agency. The company’s AI engine can be integrated at any stage of the game development cycle, she said.\n\nBrian Tanner, Artificial Agency's CEO, said scripting every possible outcome of a game can be tedious and difficult to test. Their system allows designers to act more like directors, he said, by telling characters more about their motivation and background.\n\n\"These characters can improvise on the spot depending on what’s actually happening in the game,” Tanner said.\n\nIt's easy to run into a game's guardrails, Tanner said, where NPCs keep repeating the same phrase regardless of how players interact with them. But as AI continues to evolve, that will change, he added.\n\n“It is truly going to feel like the world’s alive and like everything really reacts to exactly what’s happening,\" he said. “That’s going to add tremendous realism.”\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares in chipmaker Nvidia climbed nearly 4% in Tuesday's session, after regulatory filings showed that the company's CEO Jensen Huang had finished the planned sale of more than $700m (£523m) of the firm's shares.\n\nHuang had disclosed plans earlier this year to sell up to 6 million Nvidia shares by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The plans came under the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell shares in a planned structure.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks lower as Chinese monetary stimulus optimism wears off\n\nThe latest regulatory filing showed that Huang had hit his target on these plans earlier than expected on 12 September.\n\nA separate filing showed that following the sales Huang still held nearly 75.4 million Nvidia shares and a further 786 million shares via trusts and a partnership.\n\nWhile Nvidia's share price has seen some volatility more recently, the stock is still up 144% year-to-date as one of the companies powering the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nUK property portal Rightmove saw little movement on Wednesday morning, following the news that it had rejected a third bid of £6.1bn from Rupert Murdoch's REA Group.\n\nRightmove said its board still viewed this latest offer as \"unattractive\" and believed it \"materially undervalues the company and its future prospects\". As a result, it said the board \"unanimously\" rejected the bid.\n\nIn response, Australian property firm REA, which is majority-owned by Murdoch's News Corp, said it was \"disappointed by the latest rejection ... and is frustrated that, save for the rejection of REA's three previously disclosed proposals, REA has still had no substantive engagement with Rightmove\".\n\nREA urged Rightmove's board to engage with the Australian firm but added that there was \"no certainty\" another offer would be made to shareholders or that \"any transaction will proceed\".\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Rightmove is playing hard to get and Rupert Murdoch’s REA Group is going to have to up its game again if it has a chance of winning over the board to accept a takeover offer.\"\n\n\"With the UK government pledging to build 1.5 million new homes, interest rate cuts eyed and the property market springing into life again, Rightmove clearly sees significant growth opportunities ahead,\" she added.\n\nVisa (V)\n\nShares in Visa dropped by more than 5% in Tuesday's session, on the back of the news that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) had sued the company, alleging it had created an illegal monopoly in the debit card business and was stifling competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DoJ claimed Visa \"illegally maintains a monopoly over debit network markets by using its dominance to thwart the growth of its existing competitors and prevent others from developing new and innovative alternatives.\"\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nVisa’s general counsel Julie Rottenberg told Yahoo Finance that anyone \"who has bought something online, or checked out at a store, knows there is an ever-expanding universe of companies offering new ways to pay for goods and services.\n\n\"Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving ... This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.”\n\nVisa controls the largest debit card processing network in the US, processing more than 60% of the nation's debit card transactions.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nSemiconductor company Intel moved 1% higher on Tuesday, after it launched a pair of AI chips, as it looks to compete with rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia.\n\nThe new Xeon 6 CPU and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator chips promise better performance and power efficiency.\n\nIntel shares were already on the rise following reports that rival Qualcomm (QCOM) had approached the company about a possible takeover.\n\nIn addition, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management — which owns Yahoo — has offered to invest as much as $5bn (£3.8bn) in Intel.\n\nThis comes after a challenging period for Intel, having announced plans to layoff 15,000 employees. The chipmaker also missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings.\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nUS stocks tied to Chinese e-commerce soared on Tuesday, including online retailer JD.com, after China launched a raft of stimulus measures.\n\nShares in JD.com, which is listed on the Nasdaq (^IXIC), closed Tuesday's session nearly 14% higher.\n\nChina's central bank announced its biggest stimulus since the pandemic, which included more funding and interest rate cuts. This including reducing the interest rate on existing mortgages by 0.5%.\n\nOther Chinese e-commerce stocks also rallied on the news, including the New York-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) and Pinduoduo (PDD), which were up 8% and 11% respectively.\n\nRead more: UK stocks that have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index\n\nLindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said: \"Whilst this package of measures will certainly be welcomed, China’s problems cannot be resolved as easily as setting an appropriate level of interest rates.\n\n\"The bigger issues of weak consumer confidence linked to the deeply fractured property market, manufacturing overcapacity, reducing economic and business transparency and trade barriers continue as yet unchallenged.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Putting $300 to Work in These 3 Unstoppable Stocks Right Now Would Be a Smarter Move",
        "content": "One of the best aspects of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that most online brokers have eliminated barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sideline. Minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges are predominantly a thing of the past.\n\nFor everyday investors, it means virtually any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work in the stock market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile it might sound tempting to invest $300 in the hottest stock on Wall Street, artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), there are three unstoppable stocks that make for much smarter buys right now.\n\nFour reasons investors can safely pass on Nvidia\n\nDespite Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) absolutely dominating in high-compute data centers, there are a number of reasons to believe the company's stock has peaked and will underperform in the years to come.\n\nFor example, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation for at least three decades that's avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. Without fail, investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of new technologies and innovations, which eventually leads to real-world results falling short of otherworldly expectations. If artificial intelligence follows this path, no company is going to be hurt more than Nvidia.\n\nAnother expected headwind for Nvidia is an increase in competition. While it's well-documented that other chipmakers are ramping up production and/or debuting AI-GPUs for AI-accelerated data centers, investors are likely overlooking the prospect of internal competition. All four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own, which will undoubtedly limit future orders for the company's hardware.\n\nInsiders aren't giving investors a reason to buy, either. Nvidia's recently unveiled $50 billion buyback program, or as I refer to it, the \"smoke-and-mirrors campaign,\" doesn't hide the fact that it's been 45 months since a single share was purchased by an insider on the open market.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's valuation isn't nearly as enticing as it might appear. Shares of the company are valued at an unsightly 30 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, and briefly topped a TTM price-to-sales ratio of 40 in June.\n\nForget about Nvidia and consider putting $300 to work right now in the following three unstoppable stocks.\n\nVisa\n\nThe first sensational stock that can be bought with $300 right now, and has all the tools needed to deliver superior returns to Nvidia in the coming years, is leading payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite recessionary red flags cropping up, Visa benefits immensely from the non-linearity of the economic cycle. While recessions are both normal and inevitable, they're historically short-lived. Just three of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II endured for a full year.\n\nBy comparison, most periods of growth stick around for many years, if not a decade. Visa enjoys the spoils of lengthy growth periods and the long-term expansion of consumer and enterprise spending.\n\nAt the same time, Visa is well-protected from downturns thanks to its purposeful avoidance of lending. Although some of its peers act as lenders and payment processors, Visa solely focuses on payment facilitation. Since it doesn't lend, it's not required to set aside capital for those inevitable periods where the U.S. economy weakens. This gives Visa more financial flexibility than its peers and helps it bounce back from recessions very quickly.\n\nVisa has an incredible opportunity in overseas markets, too. Cross-border payment volume grew 14% on a constant-currency basis in Visa's latest quarter, which follows a consistent theme of sustained double-digit growth in cross-border payment volume. Many of the world's fastest-growing emerging markets are chronically underbanked, which provides Visa with a no-brainer opportunity to sustain double-digit annual earnings growth through the remainder of this decade, if not well beyond. Image source: Walt Disney.\n\nWalt Disney\n\nA second unstoppable stock that can outpace Nvidia in the return column and makes for a stellar buy right now with $300 is media goliath Walt Disney(NYSE: DIS).\n\nFew companies were clobbered more directly by the COVID-19 pandemic than Disney. The closing of theme parks, coupled with limited studio output and select movie theater closures, severely hampered its bottom line. But with China's economy reopened and studio output ramping up, Disney is shining, once more.\n\nPerhaps the best aspect of Disney's operating model is that it can't be duplicated. Even though there are no shortage of movies and shows to watch and theme parks to visit, no other company offers the history, depth of engagement, characters, or storytelling capacity that Disney brings to the table. This alone ensures that Walt Disney will continue to generate predictable cash flow from its multiple operating segments.\n\nSomething else for investors to be excited about is Disney's progress with its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment. After years of sizable losses, Disney delivered its first operating profit from its DTC segment. Being an irreplaceable media company has allowed it to increase subscription prices for all of its tiers and move its DTC segment to profitability a full quarter ahead of schedule.\n\nThe \"House of Mouse\" is also historically inexpensive. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18 marks a 31% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the prior half-decade. Further, Disney should be able to deliver sustained double-digit earnings growth as its DTC segment and studio begin to stretch their proverbial legs.\n\nPubMatic\n\nThe third unstoppable stock that makes for a smarter buy than Nvidia with $300 right now is small-cap adtech company PubMatic(NASDAQ: PUBM).\n\nPubMatic finds itself perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rise of digital advertising. Even though advertising is highly cyclical, and businesses aren't shy about paring back their marketing budget at the first sign(s) of trouble, the aforementioned non-linearity of economic cycles works in favor of ad-driven businesses. Investors with a long-term mindset should benefit from owning stakes in companies that see ad spending climb over time.\n\nOne of the key reasons PubMatic is set for success is the decision by its management team to design and develop its own cloud-based programmatic ad platform. While it would have been easy for PubMatic to rely on a third-party provider, the decision to build its own cloud-based infrastructure should result in a decisively higher operating margin as it scales its revenue.\n\nAs noted, PubMatic has honed in on the fastest-growing aspects of the advertising arena. Specifically, it's a sell-side platform aiming to sell digital display space for advertisers in mobile, video, and connected TV (CTV). All three of these segments can sustain double-digit annual ad spending growth for the foreseeable future, with CTV ad spend growing the fastest.\n\nLastly, PubMatic is sitting on a cash-rich balance sheet that gives it ample financial flexibility. The company ended June with $165.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, and no debt, and has repurchased roughly $100 million worth of its common stock. Additionally, it's working on its 10th consecutive year of generating positive operating cash flow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Oracle Founder Larry Ellison Just Delivered Fantastic News for Nvidia Stock Investors",
        "content": "Larry Ellison owns 42% of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), a $465 billion technology giant that is building some of the most powerful data centers for artificial intelligence (AI) development.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies Oracle and most other tech companies with data center chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia has experienced an eye-popping surge in its revenue over the past year, and GPU demand continues to outstrip supply. However, some investors have begun to question how much longer Oracle and its peers can throw billions of dollars at the chip giant to fuel their AI aspirations.\n\nWorries that the AI train may be starting to lose steam are a key reason Nvidia stock is trading down 14.5% from its all-time high. But the market may have missed comments this month from Ellison at Oracle's financial analyst meeting that suggest more fantastic news for Nvidia's investors.\n\nOracle is nowhere close to meeting its AI infrastructure goals\n\nOracle's data centers are unique because they are automated. Each one is operationally identical regardless of its size, and since they don't require human workers, it allows the company to build them quickly. Plus, Oracle's RDMA (random direct memory access) GPU networking technology allows data to flow from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks.\n\nSince most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, Oracle's data centers can deliver considerable cost savings compared to competing infrastructure. That's why demand is soaring from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI, Cohere, and xAI. Oracle had 85 data centers up and running with 77 more under construction as of its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), but Ellison thinks it could operate as many as 2,000 in the long term.\n\nNext year, Oracle intends to offer a cluster of 131,072 GPUs, which is a big step up from its largest clusters now, at around 32,000 GPUs. But there's another difference: The new cluster will use Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips, which can perform AI inference at 30 times the pace of its flagship H100, which Oracle currently uses. Theoretically, it's going to allow developers to build the largest AI models in history.\n\nThat's going to benefit Nvidia significantly. It generated $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) primarily from GPU sales, which was a 154% increase from the year-ago period. That growth rate slowed compared to previous quarters because the numbers have become so large, but Nvidia's customers are showing no signs of pulling back.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Oracle spent $6.9 billion on data center infrastructure in fiscal 2024, and it plans to double that figure in fiscal 2025. But it gets better.\n\nEllison's latest comments are great news for Nvidia\n\nDuring the analyst meeting, Ellison told the audience about a dinner he arranged with Tesla CEO (and xAI founder) Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto. He recalled himself and Musk begging Huang for more GPUs:\n\nPlease take our money ... take more of it. You're not taking enough. ... We need you to take more of our money. Please.\n\n-- Ellison's and Musk's comments to Jensen Huang over dinner, according to Ellison.\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) generated $2.2 billion in revenue during Q1 (primarily from renting data center capacity to customers), which was a 46% increase from the year-ago period. However, Oracle ended the quarter with a record $99 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPOs), a whopping 53% jump. The company said it signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1, which contributed to the backlog.\n\nOracle can't serve all of those AI developers -- or convert its RPO into revenue -- until it brings more data centers online, hence Ellison begging Huang for more GPUs.\n\nTesla is in a similar position. It's battling for supremacy in the autonomous self-driving software industry, and it's trying to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online by the end of this year to further train its AI models. Tesla will spend $10 billion on that infrastructure, but it's going to need more capacity over time. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNow might be a great time to buy Nvidia stock\n\nOracle and Tesla aren't the only companies spending big on data centers. Microsoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures (capex) mostly relating to AI infrastructure during its fiscal 2024 year (ended June 30), and it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Similarly, Amazon's capex spending is on track to top $60 billion this calendar year.\n\nBased on Nvidia's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.7. That's expensive compared to the 30.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which hosts many of Nvidia's big-tech peers.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's fiscal 2026 will begin at the end of January 2025, and Wall Street expects the company to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share for the year. That places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.8. In other words, investors who are willing to hold Nvidia stock for at least the next year and a half could be scooping up a bargain at its current price -- assuming Wall Street's forecast proves accurate.\n\nA slowdown in Nvidia's business will eventually come because the sheer magnitude of current AI spending will be very difficult to maintain over the long term. Plus, competition is slowly coming online in the GPU space, which could erode some of the company's market share in the next few years.\n\nHowever, based on the facts at hand today, Nvidia stock is likely a good buy at the current price. The earmarked AI spending from some of its largest customers suggests a slowdown isn't on the immediate horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s Ambition To Create More Powerful Chips That Can Accomplish Incredible Tasks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Stock Picks That Could Change Your Investment Game.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that could change your investment game according to Jim Cramer.\n\nTech Stocks Shine When Rates Are High but Struggle After Rate Cuts, Says Cramer\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer points out that tech stocks often perform well when the Federal Reserve maintains high interest rates and the economy slows down. However, when the Fed cuts rates, as it did recently, Wall Street shifts its focus to companies that can show significant earnings growth due to these lower rates. This may seem confusing, but in the stock market, cash is limited, and it's currently flowing into companies that would struggle without the rate cuts. While many stocks initially rose after the cut, they couldn't maintain those gains, leading to a market decline.\n\n\"The thing is, these tech stocks tend to be winners when the Fed keeps rates high and the economy slows. But when the Fed slams on the accelerator, as it did today, Wall Street bands together and piles into the companies that can post big earnings gains with much lower interest rates. Now, that may sound strange to you. Obviously, the real world makes no distinction between a company that does well all the time and one that does extremely well some of the time.\n\nHowever, in the crazy world of the stock market, we only have so much cash to go around, and right now, it's flowing into companies that would have been doomed in a world where the Fed didn't start cutting rates. These companies have stocks that are much prized right now, so the money funnels into them. Everything else went up but couldn't stay up after the rate cut. These did stay up; unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to allow the averages to close in the black. That's why we close in the red.\"\n\nCramer questions whether all tech stocks are now weaker and suggests that not every company will suffer the same fate. He believes there are still standout stocks in the tech sector that can thrive regardless of economic conditions, even if they don’t perform well on days when the market dips. These companies help larger businesses operate more efficiently, and there's always a demand for that kind of support, indicating that some tech players will continue to shine.\n\n\"So, is every player doomed to the same small part? Are the stocks of all tech companies weaker now? Can nothing transcend that status? Like when I went out for Bye Bye Birdie or Guys and Dolls in high school, I mean, first, no publicly traded company would ever be that low. I was totally expendable, other than as Lieutenant Rooney in ARS Gold Lace, where I don't think I ever spoke more than a few words.\n\nBut there will be stocks that shine even in tech with rates coming down. However, we come out here to find legitimate stars that can thrive regardless of the economy, and they don't do that well on days like today. Many of these outfits are about helping big companies do more with less, and there's always demand for that. They're not big players; you bring in these guys to bridge the gap and perform better with fewer people.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Drives Profit Growth Despite Slowing Sales\n\nJim Cramer also highlights that artificial intelligence is a crucial factor in today's market. Companies using AI can enhance their profit margins, increasing earnings even amid declining sales. This indicates that AI can drive profitability without needing to boost sales.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s ambition to create more powerful chips that can accomplish incredible tasks. He noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has already achieved significant breakthroughs in this field, showcasing its innovative capabilities.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is backed by its impressive Q2 2024 earnings, which exceeded analyst expectations and showed record revenue growth due to high demand for its GPUs in data centers and AI applications. As a leader in AI hardware and software,NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are essential for training and running AI models, positioning the company for ongoing growth as AI adoption increases across industries.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also enhancing its product offerings with innovations like the Hopper and Grace architectures, which improve performance for AI and high-performance computing tasks. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies help NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expand its influence in areas such as autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, and gaming.\n\nWith rising investments in AI and machine learning, analysts have raised their price targets for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting positive expectations for its growth. Recent announcements about major contracts and advancements in AI technology have further boosted investor confidence, creating a strong bullish outlook for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that could change your investment game according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘William Blair Also Initiated NVIDIA With A Buy, Noting Tremendous Demand For Its Products’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\n\nJim Cramer: Tech Companies Flourish Despite Economic Concerns\n\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut—believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\n\nBut how about the tech economy, the one based out here where we are right now? When you're talking to companies in Silicon Valley, it almost feels like the people who run these companies are like inmates who escaped from the asylum of interest rates years ago. What they do is exploit opportunities that allow them to become integral to the enterprise. They don't really care about the consumer; they're selling to businesses that then sell to you. So their total addressable market doesn't hinge on interest rates; it hinges on how innovative they are. That's a story you've heard from all the companies we've interviewed. These are companies about innovation.\"\n\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic—things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\n\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness—a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\n\nRising Stars: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Boosts Profits Even as Sales Slow\n\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

This reflects growing confidence in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s market position and potential for future growth.\n\n\"William Blair also initiated Nvidia with a buy, noting tremendous demand for its products.\"\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong outlook is supported by impressive Q2 2024 earnings, with revenue reaching $13.5 billion, a 50% increase from last year, and a net income of $5.6 billion. This growth is driven by high demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nAs a leader in the AI field, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs are essential for training machine learning models and powering AI solutions, positioning the company for continued growth as investment in AI infrastructure rises. The surge in data center revenue, particularly from cloud service providers, highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s commitment to high-performance computing solutions.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s innovative product lineup, including the H100 Tensor Core GPU designed for AI workloads, allows it to take advantage of rapid technological advancements. Strategic partnerships with major tech companies like Microsoft and Google further enhance NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s ecosystem and promote wider adoption of its products.\n\nWith strong brand recognition and a solid market share in the GPU market, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from growth in gaming, AI, and data centers. Recent announcements of AI-related product enhancements and an optimistic revenue outlook suggest sustained demand, reinforcing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s potential for significant future growth.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says William Blair Calls ARM Holdings plc (ARM) a ‘Critical Vendor’ of Computing IP With Best-In-Class Financials",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Reveals 12 Stocks Investors Should Monitor Closely.In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current state of the economy, noting that there are essentially two separate economies at play. One economy is struggling with higher interest rates, making it harder for businesses and individuals to thrive, while the other seems unaffected by these rates. This division explains why, even after a double rate cut, the stock market, including the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq, still experienced declines.\n\n\"There really are two economies in this country. There's one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it's harder to find a job, and then there's another that says we don't really care about where the rates are. That's how we can get a double rate cut today and still see the Dow dipping 103 points, the S&P declining 29 points, and the Nasdaq shedding 31 points.\"\n\nJim Cramer: Tech Companies Flourish Despite Economic Concerns\n\nJim Cramer highlights that many companies, especially retailers and restaurants serving low-income customers, are worried about high interest rates and needed the recent double rate cut to improve their forecasts. While this cut benefits the housing and industrial sectors, which initially rose in stock prices before selling off, the tech sector in Silicon Valley remains largely unaffected. Cramer describes tech leaders as having escaped the constraints of interest rates, focusing on innovation and catering to businesses rather than consumers. Their success relies more on their ability to innovate than on interest rate fluctuations.\n\n\"There are so many companies I talk to that truly worry about the economy and say they can't make their forecasts because rates are too high. We've been hearing that from most retailers and restaurants, especially those that cater to the less well-off. They needed this double rate cut—believe me. It's great for housing, and it can help the industrials; those stocks ran in anticipation and sold off when we got what we wanted. That is a very typical action.\n\nBut how about the tech economy, the one based out here where we are right now? When you're talking to companies in Silicon Valley, it almost feels like the people who run these companies are like inmates who escaped from the asylum of interest rates years ago. What they do is exploit opportunities that allow them to become integral to the enterprise. They don't really care about the consumer; they're selling to businesses that then sell to you. So their total addressable market doesn't hinge on interest rates; it hinges on how innovative they are. That's a story you've heard from all the companies we've interviewed. These are companies about innovation.\"\n\nAdditionally, he explains that tech companies are not selling everyday goods like homes, washing machines, or cars. Unlike housing, which relies on lower mortgage rates to boost sales, the tech sector focuses on creating software that simplifies the home-buying process. While lower rates can encourage new businesses, many startups are too small to need extensive software solutions.\n\n\"You see, these tech companies aren't selling homes; they aren't selling washing machines or cars or steel or plastic—things worth less than a dollar that are sold for more than a dollar at a dollar store. Housing, of course, needs lower mortgage rates to get sales going. Tech doesn't care about mortgage rates; they just want to create software that reduces some of the friction you encounter in the process of buying a home. Lower rates make it more likely that people start new companies, but most new companies are too small to need major enterprise software. Companies we talk to can see small-cap companies go up, but big enterprise software? Not so much.\"\n\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve cut rates to help control inflation, which benefits more businesses overall. However, in the tech industry, the focus is on increasing efficiency through automation, often resulting in fewer employees. These tech companies aim to avoid being affected by the Fed's decisions because relying on them would indicate weakness and vulnerability to the economic cycle, which they actively seek to evade.\n\n\"The Fed wanted to be sure that inflation is contained and going in the right direction, which then allowed them to relent and cut by 50 basis points. Now, more businesses in the East can thrive, but out here, the presumption is that all enterprises are trying to raise margins, often by automating everything that can be automated, which means using fewer people. These tech companies are automators; they never want to be hostage to the Fed. They don't want you to be hostage to the Fed because that would be a sign of weakness—a sign of cyclicality. Oh, they hate cyclicality. Why be hostage to the business cycle if you don't have to?\"\n\nRising Stars: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Boosts Profits Even as Sales Slow\n\nFinally, Jim Cramer emphasizes that many people see artificial intelligence as a key player in today's market. Companies that leverage AI can improve their profit margins, which boosts earnings even if their overall sales are declining. This means that even without increasing sales, AI can help businesses become more profitable.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, in which he analyzed several stocks. We selected 12 companies and ranked them by their ownership levels among hedge funds, beginning with those that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nJim Cramer noted that William Blair has initiated coverage of ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) with a \"buy\" rating. They described ARM ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) as a \"critical vendor\" of computing intellectual property and praised its strong financial performance, suggesting it is a top choice for investors.\n\n\"William Blair started coverage of Arm with a buy, calling it a “critical vendor” of computing IP with best-in-class financials.\"\n\nARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) has a positive outlook, backed by strong Q2 2024 results showing $1.1 billion in revenue, an 18% increase from last year. This growth comes from high demand for ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) semiconductor designs in mobile, automotive, and IoT markets, highlighting its wide appeal.\n\nARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) dominates the mobile processor market, powering most smartphones worldwide, and is also expanding in the fast-growing IoT sector due to the rise of connected devices. ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) technology is becoming increasingly important in the automotive industry, particularly with the shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles, which require advanced driver-assistance systems and in-car connectivity.\n\nStrategic partnerships with major tech companies like\n\nQUALCOMM, Incorporated\n\n(NASDAQ:QCOM) and\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA) enhance ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s market presence. ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)’s focus on innovation is clear in its investments in research and development, targeting next-generation architectures and AI capabilities for future growth.\n\nFollowing its recent IPO, ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) has gained market visibility and investor interest, allowing for further investments in technology and expansion into new markets, especially in China, which is crucial for its growth strategy. Recent product launches that emphasize energy efficiency and performance further establish ARM Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) as an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nOverall ARM ranks 11th on our list of the stocks that should be monitored closely according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD): CEO Lisa Su Said ‘She Sees Years And Years Of Upgrades And More And More Powerful Chips Needed’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the A Game Changer: Jim Cramer's Latest Top 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nJim Cramer: Billions to Flood the Market as Double Rate Cut Sparks Stock Surge!\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that a double rate cut, or a 50 basis point reduction, is likely to attract tens of billions of dollars into the stock market from investors who have been sitting on the sidelines. Many people have been holding onto cash in money funds, eager to invest, especially as rates start to decline. While some are tied up in CDs or treasuries, those inaccessible money funds see the opportunity to move their cash into high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nCramer warns that they need to act quickly, as these stocks will soon rise in price and lose their high-yield appeal. He also criticizes commentators on television who downplay the Fed's impact by focusing on the national debt. He argues that these voices are not interested in helping everyday investors; instead, they cater to the wealthy. Cramer reminds listeners that their audience is diverse, and it’s essential to focus on making informed investment decisions.\n\n\"When you get a double rate cut, meaning a 50 basis point monster, well, that's going to bring tens of billions of dollars into the stock market from the sidelines. The sidelines have been so lucrative for so long that people in money funds have been coveting their dollars. Sure, there are plenty of folks sitting in two- to three-year CDs or treasuries who can’t easily cash out, but if you're in an easily accessible money fund, you can see rates are going lower now, right? That’s all the more incentive to put your cash into, say, dividend stocks with high yields. You’ve got to do it fast because pretty soon, the high yielders will rally to the point where they’re just mid-yielders.\n\nNo matter how smart they sound, the people who come on television to argue that the Fed's actions don’t matter because the national debt is too big are being unhelpful. These people are not concerned with helping you make money; you’re not important to them. They’re speaking to the billionaire class. Yes, they crowded you out a long time ago. Remember, we do have all sorts of audiences.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer points out that many Wall Street analysts like to go against popular opinion, which leads them to downplay the importance of a half-point rate cut. He believes this perspective ignores common sense. Cramer acknowledges that while aging has its downsides, like not being able to move around as easily at events, he feels he has gained wisdom. He understands the situation better than those who argue that the rate cut indicates panic, simply by being present and observing the market.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Everybody on Wall Street loves to be a contrarian, which is why so many commentators keep trying to minimize the impact of a half-point rate cut. Not me! No matter what, common sense dictates that there are always people who think they know better than common sense, and they don’t. There are so few advantages to age, I have to tell you.\"\n\nCan the 50 Basis Point Cut Spark Stock Gains and Revive Housing?\n\nJim Cramer points out that during rate cuts, there are many promising winners to consider, while the losers are easy to spot and should be avoided. He emphasizes that when the Wall Street Journal reported the chance of a 50 basis point cut, it opened up more opportunities for stocks to benefit. A smaller 25 basis point cut could have aided homebuilders if they had built more homes, but they’ve been reluctant due to high rates. However, a 50 basis point cut will lower mortgage rates, making homes more affordable and likely giving a boost to the housing market.\n\n\"The winners in an easing cycle are varied and exciting, while the losers are obvious and must be avoided. From the moment the Journal reported that there could be a 50 basis point cut, the swatch of what can go higher expanded dogmatically. A 25-point cut would have been truly beneficial for homebuilders if they would just start building a lot more homes, that's something they've been reluctant to do because rates are still too high. But a 50 basis point cut means lower mortgages for certain and, therefore, more affordable homes.\"\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn this article, we delve into the latest episode of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he analyzed various stocks. We rank these companies based on their popularity among hedge funds, starting with the least owned and moving up to the most favored.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nJim Cramer shares that Lisa Su, CEO of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), mentioned on Mad Money that there is currently high demand for all of the company’s chips, particularly those designed for AI. Su expressed confidence in the future, stating that she anticipates years of upgrades and an increasing need for more powerful chips.\n\n\"Lisa Su, CEO of Club name Advanced Micro Devices, told me Wednesday on “Mad Money” that there is so much demand right now for all of her company’s chips, especially the AI ones. Su said she sees years and years of upgrades and more and more powerful chips needed.\"\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a favorable outlook, supported by its strong foothold in fast-growing areas such as data centers and artificial intelligence. As demand for high-performance computing rises, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s EPYC processors and Radeon graphics cards are seeing increased sales, surpassing competitors like Intel and NVIDIA\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA). The successful introduction of the Ryzen 7000 series further solidifies Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s market presence.\n\nCollaborations with major cloud providers like Microsoft\n\n(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:GOOG) enhance its integration into enterprise solutions. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a 30% increase in year-over-year revenue, reaching $5.3 billion in Q2 2024, highlighting Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) financial strength.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs,9 GPUs, FPGAs,10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace.\n\nAMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads.\n\nSimultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.”\n\nOverall AMD ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's latest top 10 stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia stock's 20% drop is actually a good sign for the market, strategist says. Here's why",
        "content": "Tony Roth, chief investment officer for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors (MTB), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series.\n\nWatch the interview above and check out the transcript, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity, below.\n\nANDY MILLS (AM): Big tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft have led the market higher over the last couple of years. Do you see that continuing in 2025?\n\nTONY ROTH (TR): Right now, we see a rotation trade into other areas of the market, but I think, longer term, we certainly expect to see those big names continue to grow earnings at a pretty rapid pace. One thing that’s important to keep in mind, though, is that it’s not a monolithic group. So there are some companies that are gonna do a lot better than others. Even within the Magnificent Seven, you’re probably going to see a rotation of some names out of that group and some names into that group.\n\nOne of the aspects of what’s happening in the market today that I think is really quite notable is that we’re at new, all-time highs as we sit here. And Nvidia (NVDA) is probably about 20% off of its all-time high. Given what we experienced in the first half of the year — where it seemed to be a market driven by a single stock — to be able to say that at this point is pretty remarkable. I think most participants might have felt that it would be hard to get to these levels on the S&P without leadership from Nvidia. And not only have we not had leadership, but it’s actually been going in another direction.\n\nAM: Yeah. So AI is, I think, for most investors, a pretty obvious place where people have been investing. What other sectors are you guys looking at that people should try to get into this year?\n\nTR: Financials have worked pretty well this year — not all equally, again, but if you look, for example, at the big money center banks, they’ve done pretty well. Some of them have done extraordinarily well, like JP Morgan, which is priced at pretty lofty levels now. But overall, right now with rates coming down, if we don’t have a recession, which is our base-case view, that should certainly favor regional banks.\n\nAnd we think that, for example, also in the financial sector, we like insurance companies, which continue to benefit from these expanded premiums. And I think a lot of the costs are probably going to abate, but the premiums won’t come down as fast. So [insurance companies will] take advantage of that leverage. It’s almost like when oil prices come down but you don’t see the price at the pump come down quite as fast. So I think you’ll see that phenomenon with insurance companies.\n\nAnd then other areas that we like are discretionary companies within this economy, because we do think the consumer, particularly the higher-end consumer, is in good shape. And beyond that, we’re really focused across all sectors on quality companies — so companies that have attractive debt-to-equity ratios that are not too levered, that have low variability of earnings, that have good management teams, intellectual property, intellectual capital, et cetera. Those kinds of companies should do well in this type of environment. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang - Photo: Lachlan Cunningham (Getty Images)\n\nAM: Now, you mentioned that your firm doesn’t see a recession as a likely scenario going forward. What makes you guys believe that?\n\nTR: I would probably start with the labor market. The labor market is really the foundation for the consumer. So when you look at the labor market, what you see is that jobless claims are at an all-time low actually relative to the overall size of the labor market. And when you look at wages, real wages are not only positive, which we haven’t seen for a long time, but if you look at what we think of as (to get a little wonky) the second derivative, which is where a real wage is going, they’re actually increasing. They’re gaining ground. So when you look at that and you consider that the top three quartiles of the consumer still have excess savings and checking accounts, et cetera, that bodes really well for the economy.\n\nSo the labor market is in pretty good shape. It’s not in great shape. It’s not in perfect shape. There are some concerning signals, as well, but that’s part of the normalization process. So the labor market’s in good shape, the consumer’s in good shape, CapEx continues to do well. And typically when you see a recession, there’s usually a catalyst. There’s usually excess investment, or there’s a bubble, a financial bubble, or there may even be an external, if you will, geopolitical or exogenous event. And so we don’t see any of those happening, necessarily.\n\nSure, that could happen as a result of the election outcome, but there are so many levels of uncertainty with the election right now that we’re not investing for that. We’ll keep a very close eye on that, but right now we’re not tying the election to a recession.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Rallied on Tuesday",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 4.8%. As of 3:20 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 4%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher were reports that the company's chief executive was done selling stock for now.\n\nSales of more than $700 million\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has sold a large block of Nvidia stock in recent months, a move that caught the attention of investors. In all, he sold roughly 6 million shares worth roughly $713 million as part of a prearranged stock trading plan put in place earlier this year.\n\nThe sales were made pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, which allows insiders to sell stock in the future according to a predetermined schedule without running afoul of insider trading rules. In more than four dozen transactions over the past three months, Huang divested 6 million shares, reaching the limit set up in the prearranged plan, suggesting the chief executive was done selling Nvidia stock -- at least for now.\n\nSome investors tend to get nervous when insiders sell stock, particularly in large quantities. Rumors that \"they know something we don't\" or \"the stock has peaked\" tend to make the rounds.\n\nThe reality is much more mundane\n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons to sell stock, especially if it makes up a large part of an executive's compensation package. That's certainly the case with Huang, as 96% of his total pay is stock options tied to Nvidia's overall stock performance. As a result, and in order to reap the rewards of successfully navigating the stock to new heights, Huang and other executives must sell stock, so there's nothing concerning or nefarious about these sales.\n\nFurthermore, Huang is still the largest individual holder of Nvidia stock. According to the company's most recent proxy statement, Huang controlled more than 93 million shares, or more than 3.75% of the outstanding stock. This alone suggests that Huang is still confident in Nvidia's future prospects.\n\nIn short: Nothing to see here, folks. Move it along.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Vistra Surpasses NVIDIA as S&amp;P 500's Top Stock in 2024: Buy Now?",
        "content": "This year, Vistra Corp.’s VST strong rally could potentially hinder NVIDIA Corporation NVDA from becoming the S&P 500’s top annual performer back to back, a title held only by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD since 1999.\n\nHowever, Vistra’s stupendous gains have made the stock pricey. So, let’s look at how to trade the VST stock.\n\nVistra (Not NVIDIA) is the S&P 500’s Top YTD Gainer\n\nWall Street darling NVIDIA squashed bubble fears and witnessed a meteoric rise this year with the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nShipment of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips by the end of the year and sheer dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market has given the magnificent 7 stock an edge over its peers.\n\nMost importantly, NVIDIA stock got a boost from the Federal Reserve’s major interest rate cuts. Lower interest rates don’t affect NVIDIA’s crucial cash flows for growth. Also, lower borrowing costs boost its profit margins (read more: Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?).\n\nAs a result, NVIDIA’s shares have soared 134.8% this year and remained the S&P 500’s top performer for quite some time. However, Vistra, a not-so-household name, toppled NVIDIA last week to become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, an index it joined not long ago.\n\nThe change in the top position took place as investors showed keen interest in an electric company rather than semiconductor stocks to play the boom in AI.\n\nVistra shares scaled upward for its nuclear power business and high demand from power-consuming AI data centers. Vistra is poised to capitalize on AI data center power needs with its exclusive gas and nuclear power plants mix.\n\nThe Vistra stock climbed 189.8% year to date, while its peers trailed, with the Utility - Electric Power industry soaring 17.2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey VST Stock Tailwinds\n\nIt’s just not power requirements for data centers that are propelling Vistra shares upward. According to analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Jefferies, Vistra stands to gain from an increase in power prices, increased plant usage and likely contracts with data centers. Hence, the $4.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate for VST’s earnings per share is up 8.9% year over year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nVistra has also generated profits significantly, which boosted its share price. After all, the VST stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 21.1%, more than the industry’s 10.4%. Any ROE above 20% is considered to be very strong. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTime to Buy VST Stock?\n\nBanking on the AI boom, increase in wholesale power prices and potential to generate profits competently not only helped Vistra to be the top performer in the S&P 500 but also will boost its shares further. Anyhow, the VST stock is trading above the 200-day moving average this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of VST by 6.6% from the stock’s last closing price of $107.88. The highest price target is at $133, an upside of 23.3%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThus, those who have invested in the VST stock should stick to it and capitalize on the strong price upside trend. But if you are thinking of buying the stock now, it may burn a hole in your pocket! This is because, per price/earnings, the VST stock, presently, trades at 23.3X forward earnings. However, the industry’s forward earnings multiple is 17.4X. So, better wait for an opportune moment to invest in the VST stock.

        "title": "Intel launches new AI chips as takeover rumors swirl",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) revealed a pair of AI chips on Tuesday as it seeks to improve its data center business and steal market share from rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). The new chips, the Xeon 6 CPU and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, promise improved performance and power efficiency and come at a time when Intel is trying to prove it has what it takes to be a major player in the AI space.\n\nThe announcement follows a Wall Street Journal report that Qualcomm is looking into a potential takeover of Intel to bolster its own chip business. Bloomberg, meanwhile, reported that Apollo Global Management is interested in making a multibillion-dollar investment in the chipmaker that would back Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s massive turnaround plan. Apollo is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\nIntel says the new Xeon 6 chip offers P-cores, or performance cores, and says it features twice the performance of its predecessor. The chip, according to the company, is built for AI and high-performance compute scenarios including edge and cloud systems.\n\nThe Gaudi 3 processor, on the other hand, is purpose-built for generative AI applications and will compete directly with Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s MI300X line of chips. Intel says IBM (IBM) is using its Gaudi 3 accelerators as part of its IBM Cloud with the goal of offering a lower overall total cost of ownership. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Demand for AI is leading to a massive transformation in the data center, and the industry is asking for choice in hardware, software, and developer tools,” Intel's executive vice president and general manager of its Data Center Artificial Intelligence Group Justin Hotard said in a statement.\n\n“With our launch of Xeon 6 with P-cores and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, Intel is enabling an open ecosystem that allows our customers to implement all of their workloads with greater performance, efficiency, and security.”\n\nIntel was also quick to point out that 73% of GPU-accelerated servers, servers designed to power AI applications, use Xeon chips as the host CPUs they need to function properly. But Intel’s chips aren’t the hot tickets they once were. Companies instead are trying to get their hands on Nvidia’s line of AI chips, sending that company’s stock price soaring.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up a staggering 142% year to date, while Intel shares have fallen a whopping 52%. AMD shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nDuring its latest quarterly earnings report in August, Intel reported worse-than-anticipated revenue and earnings per share and provided a disappointing outlook for its current quarter. The company also said it would cut 15% of its workforce and suspended its dividend payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nGelsinger is attempting to return Intel to its former glory by pushing its teams to build more advanced chips for the data center and consumer PCs while simultaneously building out its manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIntel hopes to dramatically expand its chip fabs, the facilities where it produces chips, both in the US and abroad. But the company announced last week that it will put construction of planned plants in Europe on hold and that it won’t start up its advanced packaging plant in Malaysia until demand for chips picks up.\n\nIntel offered some good news last week, as well, saying that it will build custom chips for Amazon (AMZN), joining Microsoft (MSFT) as another marquee client for the company’s nascent third-party chip manufacturing business.\n\nThe firm also said it is separating its foundry segment from its design business to provide a clearer separation between the two entities, giving potential customers greater peace of mind that Intel’s design team wouldn’t have access to their own chip designs.\n\nBut Intel’s struggles amidst the turnaround have made it a takeover target for the likes of Qualcomm, which could use the company to significantly expand its chip business into the data center and PC businesses.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) relies heavily on its smartphone segment. But smartphone sales have slowed over the years as customers have begun holding on to their handsets longer, leading Qualcomm to look for new growth opportunities.\n\nOne such opportunity includes building laptop chips meant to rival Intel’s own line of processors. It will, however, take a good deal of time for Qualcomm to chip away at Intel’s PC market share if it manages to do so at all. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "UK stocks that have outperformed the FTSE All-Share index",
        "content": "UK stocks have been unloved for some time with investors favouring the likes of the US, but data shows there are a number of British companies that have delivered market-beating returns over the past decade.\n\n“The US market has acted like a magnet in recent years and pulled investors away from the UK with the lure of fast-growth technology companies,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\nTech giants, including Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), are part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks that account for a third of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) market value.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft's (MSFT) market capitalisation of $3.2tn (£2.4tn) is bigger than that of the entire FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which stands at £2.1tn, according to the London Stock Exchange.\n\nAs such, these companies have helped drive US market returns, with the S&P 500 up 32% over one year and 91% over five years.\n\nHowever, Coatsworth said: \"A gloomier US economic outlook and rich equity valuations that side of the Atlantic suggests it might be time to add a stronger British flavour to an ISA or pension as the London market is full of stocks on attractive valuations\".\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced a bigger-than-expected 50 basis point interest rate cut last week, its first in four years, signalling to some on Wall Street that the central bank was playing catch up. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank didn't think it was \"behind\" on cutting rates but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did say in its commentary alongside the rate decision that the \"economic outlook is uncertain\".\n\nLooking at the UK market, the FTSE All-Share (^FTAS) — which is made up of the FTSE 100, FTSE 250 (^FTMC) and FTSE SmallCap (^FTSC) indices and totals 561 companies — has generated a 12% over one year and 33% over five years, according to data provided by AJ Bell.\n\nWhile the UK market more broadly hasn't quite managed to match US performance, Coatsworth said that \"clever stock pickers could have easily smashed\" the FTSE All-Share's returns. He pointed out that just under half of the stocks in the FTSE 350 — comprised of the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 — have \"trounced\" their records.\n\n“One third of these UK market-beating stocks haven’t simply had a lucky year,\" he said. Analysis by AJ Bell showed 51 individual companies in the FTSE 350 index had beaten the broader UK market in each of the past one, five and 10 years.\n\nMarket-beating UK stocks Bakery chain Greggs is a 'well-oiled machine that’s created a recipe for success', according to AJ Bell analyst Dan Coatsworth. (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nFood-on-the-go retailer Greggs, is up 32% over one-year and 69% over five years.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Greggs is a well-oiled machine that’s created a recipe for success,\" said Coatsworth.\n\nHe said that not only does it sells food and drink at an affordable price and in an efficient manner but it also continues to \"innovate and launch new products, keeping existing customers interested and enticing new ones into its stores\".\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\n\"Greggs is earning more from existing stores by having them open for longer, while at the same time it continues to open new sites,\" Coatsworth said. \"Behind the scenes, it is reinvesting cash flow into manufacturing, distribution and logistics to support its growth.\"\n\nIn its interim results released in July, Greggs posted nearly a 14% increase in sales for the period to £961m and a 16% rise in underlying pre-tax profit to £74m.\n\nTesco (TSCO.L)\n\nSupermarket chain Tesco's stock rose 38% over the last year and 54% over five years.\n\n“Despite operating in a competitive market, Tesco has held onto the top spot in the UK grocery sector thanks to hard work and determination,\" said Coatsworth. \"Discounters Aldi and Lidl have kept Tesco on its toes and ensured it has never been complacent.\"\n\nRead more: London closes gap on New York as top global financial centre\n\nThe supermarket's use of data via transactions using its Clubcard loyalty scheme allows it to gain insights into shoppers tastes and tailor promotions or push products accordingly.\n\nFirst-quarter results in June, showed sales in the UK and the Republic of Ireland were up nearly 4% like-for-like to £14.3bn.\n\nPremier Foods (PFD.L)\n\nMr Kipling-maker Premier Foods saw shares climb 51% over one year and 470% over five years.\n\nCoatsworth said the company was once a \"zombie\" company due to its debt pile but it has since resolved this issue, enabling it to reap the \"benefits of investment in the business to make it more competitive and innovative\".\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\n\"Shoppers continue to fill their baskets each week with its brands including Oxo, Bisto, Mr Kipling, Homepride and Paxo,\" he said. \"Trends come and go, but these brands are true classics and that gives Premier Foods a big advantage over its rivals.”\n\nPremier Foods' first-quarter results showed group sales of branded products were up 7% on the previous year to nearly £214m.\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nShares in Bloomsbury Publishing have surged 78% over the past year and 203% over five years.\n\nCoatsworth said that the company is \"proof that the public still loves a book, despite it feeling as if everyone is always staring at their phones\".\n\nBloomsbury has benefitted from publishing the likes of the Harry Potter franchise and Sarah J Maas' big titles, showing it is a \"dab hand at spotting talent\".\n\n\"It is good at making money from new and old titles, reworking books via new editions and capturing new generations of readers,\" said Coatsworth. \"It has also done well in the education market, diversifying revenue streams and making the business less reliant on a handful of authors.”\n\nBack in May, the publisher reported that it had achieved its highest revenue and profit in its 37-year history for the year ended 29 February. The company recorded 30% revenue growth at £343m.\n\nBAE Systems (BA.L)\n\nDefence company BAE Systems has been another strong performer on the UK market, with shares up 28% over one year and 142% over five years.\n\n“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made governments around the world sit up and think more seriously about defence capabilities,\" said Coatsworth.\n\n\"That has led to greater spending across the defence spectrum, creating a tailwind for companies like BAE Systems,\" which produces defence, aerospace and security solutions.\n\n\"Greater cybersecurity spending has also been a tailwind for the UK defence champion as it has the strength to flex both its physical and digital muscles.\"\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nBAE Systems posted 13% growth in first-half sales last month, at £13.4bn, along with a 13% increase in underlying earnings before interest and tax, at £1.4bn.\n\nCoatsworth said that these star performers on the London market demonstrated that investors \"don’t have to choose between the US and UK markets as having a blend of both would help to spread risks.\"\n\nHe said: \"History suggests a portfolio where all the components don’t move in unison can provide a lower-risk experience for investors. Having certain things go up when others are going down means the investor isn’t risking all of their money on one area.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "4 Bitcoin-Centric Stocks Set to Gain Big From Fed's Recent Rate Cut",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally that had stalled for some time has started showing signs of a solid rebound. Bitcoin (BTC), which surged above $60,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, was trading above $63,600 on Monday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve interest rate cut announced last week has been helping Bitcoin bounce back from its recent lows. Experts had predicted that Bitcoin still has a lot of potential and the recent decline was temporary. Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Bitcoin-centric stocks such as Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and BlackRock, Inc. BLK.\n\nBitcoin Rebounds on Rate Cut Announcement\n\nOn Monday, Bitcoin was trading at $63,658.52 after surpassing the $60,000 mark for the first time in more than a month ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement.\n\nBitcoin’s price declined substantially after hitting an all-time high of $73,750 on Mar 14. The cryptocurrency saw its price falling below $55,000 in early August after a broader market bloodbath on fears of a slowing economy.\n\nPrior to that, the halving event also failed to boost Bitcoin. The halving event, which usually reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by 50% to cap the total supply at 21 million, often leads to higher demand and prices.\n\nHowever, following the latest halving, Bitcoin’s value saw a significant decline.\n\nRate Cuts to Boost Bitcoin\n\nThe rate cut was highly anticipated to boost Bitcoin and did so. Market participants had expected that the Federal Reserve would go for a 25-basis point rate cut. However, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in its bid to help boost the health of the broader economy.\n\nBitcoin has since been on a rally. Lower interest rates typically help growth assets like cryptocurrencies because it lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. In a low-interest-rate setting, investors are more likely to seek out assets with higher potential returns, even if they come with increased risk.\n\nAlso, the rate cut cycle has just begun. Market participants are hopeful about another 50 basis-point rate cut in total this year, which bodes well for the cryptocurrency market.\n\n4 Crypto-Centric Stocks With Scope for Upside\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nRobinhood Markets operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 38.2% over the past 60 days. Robinhood Markets currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group\n\nInteractive Brokers Group is a global automated electronic broker.

        "title": "Increasing Investments in AI to Boost Micron's Q4 Earnings",
        "content": "Micron Technology, Inc. MU is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Sept. 25.\n\nMicron is likely to have recorded yet another strong financial performance this time around, driven by an improving demand-supply environment for memory chips and rising investments in artificial intelligence (AI). Micron, with its advanced product portfolio, is likely to have capitalized on the demand for high-performance memory and storage solutions.\n\nClick here to know how MU’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter results are likely to be.\n\nMicron’s Q4 Results to be Aided by Rising AI Investment\n\nThe rapid expansion of the global AI market resulted in a surge in investment, driving demand for advanced technologies and infrastructure. AI applications, known for their data-intensive nature, require immense computational power and lightning-fast data processing. As a result, memory and storage solutions — like those produced by Micron — have become critical components in powering AI systems.\n\nMicron’s core products, such as DRAM and NAND flash memory, are pivotal in enabling the speed and capacity needed for these cutting-edge AI tasks. The demand for these components has translated into substantial growth for the company, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate projecting fourth-quarter DRAM revenues at $5.26 billion — a staggering 91% increase year over year. Similarly, NAND revenues are expected to surge 91.5% to $2.31 billion. This explosive growth highlights the crucial role Micron is playing in the AI revolution.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote\n\nA key factor likely to have driven Micron's growth is its strong partnerships with industry leaders like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, two companies at the forefront of AI innovation. As these giants expand their AI capabilities, they rely heavily on Micron’s memory solutions to power their latest advancements. This has resulted in a surge of orders for Micron, fueling its top-line growth.\n\nNVIDIA, a dominant player in AI and GPU development, depends on Micron's high-performance memory solutions to enhance the capabilities of its AI chips. In February 2024, Micron began mass production of its HBM3E high-bandwidth memory for NVIDIA’s newest AI chip. This memory technology is expected to be a game-changer for NVIDIA’s forthcoming H200 GPUs, which will eventually replace the popular H100 chips.\n\nMicron’s partnership with AMD has also proved to be highly beneficial. Advanced Micro Devices in a bid to solidify its position in the AI and data center markets, requires robust memory solutions to unlock the full potential of its high-performance processors and GPUs. Micron’s cutting-edge memory technologies have been essential in supporting AMD’s AI workloads, leading to more orders and higher revenues. Notably, in June 2024, Micron announced that AMD would be testing samples of its GDDR7 graphic memory in upcoming devices, further strengthening this collaboration.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, rising AI investments and Micron’s strategic partnerships with tech giants have positioned the company for continued success. These factors are likely to have aided MU’s overall performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMicron’s Zacks Rank & Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nA top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is AudioEye AEYE which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AudioEye’s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 10 cents to 47 cents per share in the past 60 days, implying an increase of 327.3% on a year-over-year basis. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 25%.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Stock That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the most valuable company in the world right now with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. But a closer look at the company's recent financial performance indicates that it is finding it difficult to put its growth into a higher gear.\n\nFor instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29), Apple's revenue increased just 5% year over year to $85.8 billion. Analysts are expecting this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to finish the year with a 9% increase in revenue to $390 billion. Additionally, its revenue is expected to increase by just 8% in the next fiscal year.\n\nThis lukewarm growth at Apple can be attributed to the company's already massive revenue base. Moreover, Apple's bread-and-butter end market of smartphones is already quite huge, and its growth has stagnated. Market research firm IDC estimates that the global smartphone market could reach an annual growth rate of just 2.3% through 2028.\n\nConsidering that Apple is reliant on the iPhone for 52% of its revenue, it is not surprising to see that it's not expected to grow at a blistering pace anymore. This is precisely the reason Apple could lose its crown as the world's most valuable company to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), a company that is sitting on lucrative and fast-growing end markets that could help it deliver impressive growth over the next decade.\n\nLet's look at the reasons why Nvidia could be worth more than Apple after a decade.\n\nNvidia is set to benefit from massive growth opportunities in multiple end markets\n\nNvidia is currently the third-most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $2.85 trillion, which means that it is not very far from catching Apple. The terrific pace at which Nvidia has been growing tells us that it can indeed catch the iPhone maker over the next decade.\n\nThe company, which is known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), reported phenomenal revenue growth of 122% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to $30 billion. Nvidia has been riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave, with its chips being deployed for training popular AI models such as ChatGPT. And now, Nvidia is diversifying into areas beyond AI training so that it can sustain its handsome growth for a long time to come.\n\nFor instance, on its August earnings conference call, Nvidia management pointed out that AI inference applications have accounted for more than 40% of its data center revenue. This is an important trend to note as inference is the process of using a trained AI model to generate results from a fresh set of data. So, Nvidia has moved beyond AI training and is now getting a nice chunk of revenue from the AI inferencing space as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's good news for the company's long-term prospects as its presence in both these markets should allow it to remain a dominant force in AI chips. Investors should note that the market for AI chips is expected to generate $300 billion in revenue in 2034, growing at an annual rate of 22% over the next decade.\n\nNvidia reportedly controls 70% to 95% of the AI chip market, according various estimates, leaving very little for rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. It won't be surprising to see that trend continue over the next decade as well, as a result of which Nvidia could sustain its elevated levels of growth for a long time to come.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia is diversifying into lucrative markets such as AI enterprise software, where it has started witnessing impressive growth. This could unlock another lucrative growth opportunity for the company as the AI software market is expected to generate a whopping $1 trillion in revenue by 2032, according to Precedence Research.\n\nThen again, Nvidia has other solid growth drivers in the form of the nascent but potentially massive cloud gaming space where it has already established a solid position for itself. All this explains why the company is forecast to grow at a much faster pace than Apple.\n\nFaster growth could help the chipmaker overtake Apple's market cap\n\nAnalysts are expecting Apple's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% over the next five years. There is a chance that the iPhone maker's earnings growth could accelerate in the long run thanks to the growing contribution of the company's high-margin services business, but it is likely to be hamstrung by the slow pace of growth in smartphone sales over the next decade.\n\nPrecedence Research estimates that the global smartphone market could see 7% annual growth through 2034. While that's rosier than IDC's forecast, Precedence believes that the adoption of technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality are likely to help the smartphone market achieve faster growth. But it is worth noting that these technologies have been around for some time and they haven't been enough to inject life into the smartphone market.\n\nOn the other hand, the advent of AI turned out to be a massive catalyst for Nvidia. Analysts are forecasting the company's earnings to increase at a CAGR of 52% over the next five years, a much faster pace than what Apple is expected to report. Moreover, Nvidia's end markets are set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple's, and the good part is that the company is the dominant player in most of those markets.\n\nSo, there is a good chance that Nvidia could outperform Apple's growth by a big margin over the next decade, and the market could reward the former with more upside as a result and help it become a more valuable company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Intel’s years of missteps leave it fighting for survival in the Nvidia-dominated AI era",
        "content": "Henry V had Agincourt. Gen. Robert E. Lee had Gettysburg. And Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has Chandler. That would be Chandler, Ariz., outside Phoenix, where Intel is investing nearly $30 billion to build two state-of-the-art semiconductor plants, or fabs, that will be the first to use the company’s newest chipmaking process. It’s here, in Chandler, where Gelsinger’s fate—and likely that of the company he leads—will be decided.\n\nGelsinger, who was named CEO in 2021, has essentially bet the company on 18A, a new chipmaking process. He hopes it will position Intel as a viable alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world’s leading contract manufacturer of chips.\n\nThe reason for Intel’s struggles is clear: It fell victim to a classic innovator’s dilemma—not once but twice. First, early in the 21st century, its preoccupation with producing chips for PCs and data centers led it to miss the smartphone revolution. Then, in the past decade, it missed the emergence of chips designed for artificial intelligence.\n\nIntel rival Nvidia took a type of chip originally designed for the demands of video games, the graphics processing unit (or GPU), and turned it into the workhorse for training and running AI models. Now the generative-AI boom has made Nvidia one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth more than $3 trillion, compared with Intel’s relatively paltry $84 billion.\n\nGelsinger is racing to reverse Intel’s slide by repositioning the company around manufacturing excellence, while also trying to establish Intel as a player in the market for AI chips. Many are skeptical he can pull it off and fear the company may be in permanent decline.\n\nIntel wound up in such dire straits owing to missteps in its core business for central processing units (CPUs), in which it was once the unrivaled king. Production delays and problems in its own fab facilities have let rival AMDsteal significant market share.\n\nDistracted while trying to fix these issues, Intel failed to see the extent to which graphics chips would come to dominate the market for AI. Instead, it thought AI would be run on systems that still had CPUs at their heart.\n\n“The strategy has been to fix the core business and don’t worry about the ancillary stuff,” says Alan Priestley, a Gartner vice president analyst. “GPUs were the ancillary stuff.”\n\nEven after Intel belatedly recognized the fast-growing market for AI-specific chips, it bungled its efforts to get into the AI game. In 2019, it announced its own GPU design for AI called Ponte Vecchio. But the design was complicated, requiring three different fab processes to make, and expensive. Worse, its performance couldn’t match that of Nvidia’s chips. This year, Gelsinger shelved Ponte Vecchio in favor of a new design due in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel also bought AI chip startups but struggled to turn their products into blockbusters. In 2016, it purchased Nervana for $350 million, but took years to roll out chips based on its technology. When it did, they had already been eclipsed by Nvidia. Then in 2019, it bought Israeli AI chip startup Habana Labs for $2 billion. Intel says Habana’s chips beat Nvidia’s. But these claims have not been independently verified, and Intel expects only $500 million in sales from Habana’s latest chips this year, compared with Nvidia’s tens of billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request to make Gelsinger or other executives available to comment for this article. But Gelsinger publicly acknowledges the impossibility of displacing Nvidia’s dominance in chips for training large AI models anytime soon. “In that race, you know, [Nvidia] are so far ahead,” the CEO said at a technology conference in August.\n\nInstead, Gelsinger thinks Intel can compete in the market for AI inference— running AI models that have already been trained. He also says another new Intel chip will be a hit for use in laptops and PCs that run AI applications.\n\nBut Intel’s board has reportedly voiced concerns about Gelsinger’s AI strategy not being aggressive enough to ensure Intel will play a significant role in what is now the fastest-growing market for chips.\n\nGelsinger’s immediate problem is that Intel is hemorrhaging cash. The 18A gamble is expensive. The company has committed $185 billion to build new fabs and upgrade existing ones.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nMeanwhile, costs for Intel’s planned Arizona fabs and two more in Ohio have soared past initial projections. The Arizona plants, which Intel is counting on having online in 2025, have been hit by construction delays. And in September, Reuters reported that Broadcom, which makes networking and radio chips, had tested Intel’s process and concluded it was not yet ready for full production.\n\nAmid this bad news, Intel’s foundry business has notched a few precious wins: In September, Amazon’s AWS agreed to manufacture a next-generation AI chip at Intel’s 18A fabs. Intel previously struck a similar deal with Microsoft.\n\nFinding the money to pay for 18A, though, is rapidly becoming an existential crisis. Intel’s annual sales have flagged—down $24 billion, or 30%, since Gelsinger took over. In 2022, the company’s free cash flow turned negative. It has worsened since then. As of late June, Intel was burning through $12.6 billion more cash than it was taking in on an annual basis. Investors have reacted to the cascade of troubles by punishing Intel’s stock, driving its shares down almost 60% so far this year.\n\nTo reassure Wall Street, Gelsinger has been forced into painful decisions. In August, he announced $10 billion in cost cutting that included laying off 15,000 employees—15% of Intel’s workforce. He also reduced capital spending by $5 billion and suspended Intel’s dividend.\n\nThen, in September, he announced more radical action: Intel’s foundry business will be formally spun off as a separate subsidiary. The hope is that this will reassure potential foundry customers that their design secrets won’t leak to Intel’s product division and that Intel won’t prioritize its own production needs over theirs. Critically, it will also let the foundry business raise capital from outside investors, possibly alleviating Intel’s cash woes. Gelsinger also shelved plans for a new $32 billion fab in Germany, as well as new facilities in Poland.\n\nThe company has turned to the U.S. government for help, too. Intel has been counting on money from the U.S. CHIPS Act, signed by President Biden to boost domestic chip production, to assist in paying for some of its new 18A fabs. In March it was awarded $8.5 billion in direct CHIPS funding and $11 billion in loans. But the money is tied to Intel hitting certain construction milestones, and it has yet to receive any funds.\n\nAt some point Gelsinger may be forced to choose between preserving Intel’s core chip-design division—and selling off the foundry business entirely, an admission that his 18A strategy has failed. Whatever Intel ultimately does, drastic measures are likely necessary if Gelsinger still hopes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nThis article appears in the October/November 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline \"A wounded Intel battles for survival in the AI era.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding, which operates a fast-growing cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) business, is emerging as a major enabler and funder of China's AI industry, as witnessed by the company's flagship annual Apsara Conference that concluded on Saturday.\n\nHeld in Hangzhou, the capital of eastern Zhejiang province, the event has become an important platform for the country's emerging AI start-ups, whether they are focused on large language model (LLM) development or generative AI applications, to showcase their latest breakthroughs and discuss the tech trends in the AI sector.\n\nNow in its 16th year, Apsara reflects how Alibaba has emerged as a major enabler of China's booming AI industry, with its sprawling investments in sector start-ups as well as its expanded partnerships with traditional industries. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The Apsara Conference... has now become a benchmark for the development of global cloud computing and artificial intelligence,\" according to Liu Jie, Hangzhou's communist party secretary who delivered a speech on the opening day of the event last Thursday.\n\nThis year's conference was estimated to attract more than 280 companies and an audience of over 90,000, according to Liu.\n\nVisitors interact with a humanoid robot at the Apsara Conference 2024 in Hangzhou, Sept. 19, 2024.

It mainly showcased its self-developed Yi foundational LLM at the event.\n\nMotiff, a Beijing-based start-up with global headquarters in Singapore, which focuses on AI-powered professional interface design tools, was another first time participant at the Apsara Conference this year.\n\nFan Kai, in charge of research and development at the company, was a speaker at a sub-forum about the importance of data resources in the future development of generative AI applications.\n\n\"As the capabilities of large models continue to increase and costs continue to decrease, professional data will become a more scarce resource, providing a solid guarantee for the quality of AI applications,\" said Fan.\n\nAlibaba Cloud itself has been doubling down on the development of its Tongyi AI family, which includes the Tongyi Qianwen LLM and Tongyi Wanxiang image generation model.\n\nTongyi, the foundational model, has attracted over 300,000 customers via its generative AI platform Model Studio, the cloud unit announced at the conference. That marked a significant jump from 90,000 revealed in May.\n\nAlibaba chief executive Eddie Wu Yongming delivers remarks at the opening of the three-day Apsara Conference last Thursday.

In the three months to June, AI-related product revenue continued to see triple-digit, year-on-year growth, according to the company.\n\nAt last week's event, Alibaba Cloud revealed a number of case studies showing how it empowers customers and partners with its Tongyi models and cloud infrastructure. They include a partnership with electric vehicle maker Xpeng to enhance the smart cockpit experience, as well as providing cloud infrastructure support for Shanghai-based gaming powerhouse miHoYo in launching new games.\n\nApsara also provided a rare opportunity for foreign companies - especially US semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia - to showcase their offerings for China's AI industry.\n\nNvidia, which is trying to strike a balance between stringent US export controls, which have banned the sale of its most-advanced graphics processing units to China, and the huge market size of the country, did not take part in state-backed AI events like the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) this year, but it showed up at the Apsara Conference, using a half-day forum to explain how it can contribute to China's AI development.\n\nCompany global vice-president He Tao said at the Nvidia-hosted sub-forum on Friday that the US firm is working with Alibaba Cloud on the \"infrastructure aspect to meet people's extreme demand for computing power\". He also highlighted the company's long-standing presence at the event, saying it was his 11th time attending the Apsara Conference.\n\nNvidia's booth in the exhibition area mostly showcased its software and hardware products for accelerated computing.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Spotting Winners: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) And Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks In Q2\n\nAs the Q2 earnings season comes to a close, it’s time to take stock of this quarter’s best and worst performers in the processors and graphics chips industry, including Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nAfter much suspense, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. This marks the central bank’s first easing of monetary policy since 2020 and the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. Inflation had begun to run hot in 2021 post-COVID due to a confluence of factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have prompted some concern. Going forward, the markets will debate whether this rate cut (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is perfect timing to support the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nAmidst this news, processors and graphics chips stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 5.9% since the latest earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q2: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $124.1 million, down 34.7% year on year. This print fell short of analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. Overall, it was a disappointing quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nEsam Elashmawi, Interim Chief Executive Officer & Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, said, \"Second quarter 2024 results reflect the impact of cyclic industry headwinds. While the industry continues to go through a period of inventory normalization, we are starting to see signs of improvement. We continue to execute on our ongoing product portfolio expansion and remain well positioned for long-term growth.\"\n\nStory continues Lattice Semiconductor Total Revenue\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 4.8% since reporting and currently trades at $52.30.\n\nIs now the time to buy Lattice Semiconductor? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 6.9% since reporting.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold 84% of Appaloosa's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap Cyclical Stock",
        "content": "Although all eyes have seemingly been on the Federal Reserve and monthly inflation reports of late, what can arguably be described as the most important data release of the third quarter occurred roughly six weeks ago.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides investors with an over-the-shoulder look of which stocks Wall Street's most-successful money managers purchased and sold in the most recent quarter (in this case, the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile 13Fs have their noted flaws -- they're 45 days old when filed, thus providing stale information for active hedge funds -- they can still offer invaluable guidance as to which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the undivided attention of Wall Street's greatest investment minds.\n\nAside from seeing what Wall Street's most-prominent investors has been up to, such as Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, investors tend to play very close attention to what billionaire David Tepper and his team have been up to at Appaloosa. That's because Tepper's fund has posted a gross annualized return of more than 28% in the 30-year stretch from its inception in 1993 through 2023.\n\nInterestingly, Tepper and his team were big-time net-sellers of equities during the second quarter, with nine positions being added to, two positions completely closed, and 26 reduced. Perhaps none of these reductions stand out more than artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nDavid Tepper slashed his fund's stake in AI colossus Nvidia -- and probably for good reason\n\nTepper's Appaloosa closed out the March-ended quarter with 4.42 million shares of Nvidia. Between the start of April and the end of June, amid Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split and its march to an all-time intra-day high of $140.76 per share, Tepper oversaw the disposition of 3.73 million shares, or 84.39% of his fund's previous stake.\n\nWhile some of this selling activity likely had to do with locking in profits on a position that's up substantially since it was initiated in the first quarter of 2023, there are a number of other reasons Tepper and his team likely jettisoned most of their stake in Nvidia.\n\nFor starters, there are viable reasons to believe an AI bubble is brewing. No company on the leading edge of a next-big-thing technology or innovation for 30 years has escaped a bubble-bursting event. With most businesses lacking well-defined plans to generate a positive return on their AI investments anytime soon, it looks as if investors have, once again, overestimated the uptake and utility of a new technology. If the AI bubble bursts, no company would take it on the chin more than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nTepper and his team at Appaloosa may also be expecting competition to ramp up in the AI arena. Though Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) accounted for a roughly 98% share of those shipped in 2022 and 2023 to data centers, external competitors are ramping up production of their AI-GPUs.\n\nFurthermore, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are working on AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even though Nvidia's hardware should retain is computing superiority, the cost and supply advantage of using internally developed chips means Nvidia is going to lose out on future orders.\n\nInsider selling is yet another reason Appaloosa's brightest investors might be souring on Nvidia. While there are a number of reasons to sell stock, some of which are benign, the only reason to purchase shares on the open market is because you think they'll head higher. The last time an Nvidia insider bought shares of their company's stock on the open market was December 2020!\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that David Tepper traditionally focuses on undervalued or distressed assets. Right now, the stock market is historically pricey. When equities eventually roll over, which is what happens when valuations become extended, companies with lofty premiums, such as Nvidia, are often hit the hardest.\n\nBut what's even more interesting than billionaire David Tepper dumping most of his fund's stake in Nvidia is the exceptionally cheap cyclical stock he chose to pile into during the June-ended quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper can't stop buying this historically cheap consumer cyclical stock\n\nThough Tepper and his team added to nine existing positions in the second quarter, the one that really stands out is the 660,737 shares purchased of China's No. 2 e-commerce company, JD.com(NASDAQ: JD). This increased Appaloosa's stake by a little over 18% and lifted the fund's holding to 4,310,600 shares, which is worth about $116 million, as of this writing.\n\nChina stocks have absolutely hit a rough patch over the past couple of years. Stringent provincial lockdowns and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in all sorts of supply chain problems for the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nTo add, China's regulatory climate is strict and unpredictable. Even with faster economic growth, investors tend to be leery about paying higher multiples for China-based stocks given regulatory unknowns.\n\nNevertheless, JD has a number of long-term catalysts in its sails, and its stock is jaw-droppingly cheap.\n\nThe obvious catalyst for JD is that China's economy usually grows at a faster pace than most developed countries. While the economic ramp-up since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in December 2022 has been disappointing, the Chinese economy should find its footing relatively soon.\n\nBuilding on this point, China is still in the relatively early stages of expanding the reach of e-commerce to its burgeoning middle class. Whereas e-commerce is a mature concept in the U.S., it can still offer substantive growth in the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nOn a more company-specific basis, JD appears better equipped to deliver superior long-term margins when compared to China's leading online retail sales platform, Alibaba. Whereas the latter generates the bulk of its revenue from acting as a third-party marketplace, JD operates more like Amazon. In other words, it controls the inventory and logistics needed to get products to consumers, once ordered. Being able to control more aspects of its network should allow JD to outpace Alibaba on the margin front.\n\nJD is also generating enough cash flow and has deep enough pockets to branch into new ventures. Aside from its Logistics operations, it has a Health division, and has been aggressively investing in AI to improve various facets of its company. This includes leaning on AI to make predictions about its supply chain and inventory.\n\nLastly, JD is swimming in cash. It closed out June with $28.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, compared to $8.6 billion in short- and long-term debts and unsecured senior notes. That's just over $20 billion in net cash for a company with a $41 billion market cap.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Sept. 18, shares of JD were trading at just 6.5 times consensus earnings per share for 2025 -- and this doesn't account for nearly half the company's value being tied up in cash. It's an incredible bargain that billionaire David Tepper is smart to pile into.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got Good News From Wall Street: The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Boom Is Thriving",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the market. Its split-adjusted share price has increased nearly 700% since 2023. But the stock has actually slipped 14% since peaking around $136 per share in June, shortly after the company completed its 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nOne reason for the backslide is uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of AI spending. Investors want proof that capital expenditures are boosting revenue growth and productivity. But scant supporting evidence has led to concerns about AI budget cuts.\n\nAnother reason for the backslide is the sequential decline in Nvidia's gross margin in the recent quarter, a potential sign of competitive pressure. Several companies are designing custom AI chips, and investors are worried that Nvidia could lose its market dominance.\n\nHowever, Wall Street has good news for Nvidia shareholders on both fronts. Here are the important details.\n\nJPMorgan says investments in AI infrastructure are building momentum\n\nJonathan Linden and Joe Seydl at JPMorgan believe capital expenditures related to artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure are still building momentum. They estimate spending from five hyperscale cloud companies -- Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Oracle -- will increase at 24% annually over the next five years, up from 15% annually over the last five.\n\nAdditionally, Linden and Seydl expect AI to have a measurable impact on productivity by the end of the decade. That may sound like the distant future, but they explained that the interval between technological innovation and productivity gains is actually shrinking. \"Think of it this way: It took 15 years for the personal computer to increase the economy's productivity. AI could do it in seven.\"\n\nThe International Data Corp. forecasts artificial intelligence will add $4.9 trillion to the global economy in 2030, up from $1.2 trillion this year. In that scenario, AI would account for 3.5% of global GDP when the decade ends. The implications of that estimate are enormous: Investments in AI are not only worthwhile, but also critical for businesses that hope to keep up with their competitors.\n\nNaysayers will undoubtedly write AI off as an overhyped technology in the coming years, just as some people did with the internet in the 1990s. And AI stocks may suffer a massive drawdown at some point, just as internet stocks did in the early 2000s. But the naysayers will ultimately be proven wrong, and Nvidia's share price could climb much higher in the future. Indeed, Beth Kindig at the I/O Fund believes Nvidia could be a $10 trillion company by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley says Nvidia's competitors consistently come up short\n\nNvidia builds the most covered graphics processing units (GPUs) in the computing industry. The company accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and those processors are the gold standard in accelerating AI workloads. Nvidia's market share in AI chips exceeds 80%, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nThe tidal wave of demand for AI infrastructure has naturally drawn more competitors to the market. That includes chipmakers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple. All of them have designed alternative GPUs or custom AI accelerators. But CEO Jensen Huang is confident that Nvidia chips offer the \"lowest total cost of ownership,\" meaning chips with cheaper price points may actually cost more once associated expenses are included.\n\nEven so, Nvidia will almost certainly lose some market share as custom AI accelerators become increasingly popular in the years ahead. But losing some market share is not the same as losing its market leadership. Nvidia's superior hardware, coupled with its robust ecosystem of supporting software for developers, give the company a deep competitive moat that rivals find it difficult to overcome.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley said as much in a recent note. \"We have seen many threats to Nvidia come and go since 2018 -- something like a dozen start-ups, several efforts from merchant competitors such as Intel and AMD, and several custom designs. Most of those have come up short. Competing with Nvidia, a company that spends $10 billion per year in R&D, is a difficult feat.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to grow rapidly\n\nWall Street is very bullish on Nvidia. Of the 64 analysts following the company, 94% rate the stock a buy and the remaining 6% rate the stock a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling the stock right now. And Nvidia has a median price target of $150 per share, which implies 29% upside from its current share price of $116, according to CNN Business.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to increase at 36% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 54 times earnings look quite reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, a substantial discount to the three-year average of 3.1. That's good news for prospective investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Davidson downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, keeping their price target unchanged at $475, still implying around an 8% upside from current levels.\n\nThe firm noted that Microsoft's early investments and commercial product rollouts initially gave the company an advantage over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG), who it said were both \"caught flat-footed.\"\n\nSince then, Amazon and Google \"have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think you can start telling that they've caught up,\" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance on Monday (video above).\n\n\"Going forward, we think AWS [Amazon Web Services] and GCP [Google Cloud Platform] actually have an advantage over [Microsoft] Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU — something Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.\"\n\nCiting their own hyperscaler semiconductor data, the analysts at D.A Davidson said Microsoft is \"beholden\" to Nvidia, its supplier of AI chips.\n\n\"Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders,\" Luria said.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley recently reported, Microsoft has embarked on broad push to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.\n\nThe company has been plowing cash into building out its AI data centers, with its latest quarterly capital expenditures topping out at $19 billion, up 35% from the prior quarter.\n\nMicrosoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its cloud Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.\n\nDespite Monday's downgrade, Microsoft shares were trading mostly flat. The stock, which topped in July, is up roughly 15% year-to-date.

        "content": "Microsoft's AI Lead Shrinks: Analyst Downgrades Stock As Amazon And Google Close The Gap\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded the rating on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Neutral from Buy while maintaining a price target of $475.\n\nLuria noted competition has essentially caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation.\n\nThe analyst now ranked Microsoft fourth within the Magnificient Six. The stock increased 92% since his January 2023 initiation, compared to 49% for the S&P500.\n\nLuria noted that Microsoft has accelerated growth and extended margins over the last few quarters as the first to embrace and commercialize generative AI. Through an early investment in OpenAI and the ability to quickly deploy capabilities within Azure and GitHub, it took a significant lead over Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which translated to superior results over the prior 4-6 quarters.\n\nThe analyst noted that Microsoft’s lead is now diminished in both the cloud and code generation businesses, making it difficult for Microsoft to continue to outperform.\n\nLuria said AWS is already adding nearly as much cloud business as Azure after a few quarters of Microsoft adding more business. Google Cloud Platform’s expansion has also seen its business accelerate to comparable growth rates as Azure prior quarter.\n\nThe analyst’s new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in deploying their silicon into their data centers, giving them a significant advantage over Azure in the future.\n\nWhile Microsoft has discussed its Maia chips, it is years behind Amazon and Google and seems to be using them only to run Azure OpenAI Services workloads, he flagged. Luria noted this means Microsoft has been escalating an arms race it may not be able to prevail. He said this makes Microsoft beholden to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which means it will continue to shift wealth from its shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.\n\nAfter significant margin expansion last year, Microsoft is now guiding for a decline in operating margins to pay for the data center capex, increasing from 12% to 21% of revenue, Luria emphasized. This is a higher rate of increase than Amazon and Google due to Microsoft’s greater reliance on Nvidia.\n\nThe analyst said that Microsoft overinvests at these rates yearly, diminishing margins by at least 100 bps cumulatively. To offset the margin drag, Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment.\n\nWhile Nvidia and others have pointed to a strong ROI for hyperscalers such as Azure, Luria flagged that these returns may only last for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst noted Azure’s growth may be boosted by self-funded revenue, such as from OpenAI.\n\nLuria noted Microsoft has also lost much of the lead for GitHub Copilot. Not only have Amazon and Gitlab mostly caught up to GitHub Copilot’s capabilities, he said Cursor has become the new standard.\n\nLuria projected fiscal first-quarter 2025 revenue of $64.2 billion and EPS of $2.96.\n\nPrice Action: MSFT stock is down 0.50% at $433.10 at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for MSFT\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Citigroup Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for MSFT\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nFollowing the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market roared to new highs but quickly lost enthusiasm as investors look for clues on what might be ailing the economy that pushed the Fed to go more dovish than expected. However, others think the bull market is going to continue.\n\nBMO Capital’s Brian Belsk has raised the S&P 500 target for 2024 to 6,100 from 5,600. Talking to CNBC in a latest program, Belsk said the “resiliency” of this bull market is “undoubted.”\n\nThe analyst said that the stock market is going higher through the end of this year.\n\n“We do believe that the Fed is doing a great job. We believe the Fed that we are not hitting into a recession. We believe the Fed that we are heading into more of a soft landing,” the analyst said.\n\nBelsk thinks we are in the “1995-1996 environment” where we can “handle” the 24x earnings multiple.\n\nThe analyst added that the Mag. 7 stocks underperformed the market in the third quarter and yet the broader market grew, which shows the market rally is broad.\n\nFor this article we chose 10 AI stocks trending on the back of latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nBernstein’s Stacy Rasgon said in a latest interview with CNBC that while NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has been sideways amid concerns about Blackwell delays, it still has more room to run.\n\n“The demand remains off the charts. It seems like the customers cannot get enough of what it is they are delivering.”\n\nRasgon said that the concerns around Blackwell delays will fizzle out as the company has big production plans for Q4 and next year.\n\n“I still think this one has legs,” the analyst said of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock.\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCommenting on the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, Jim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that the “double” rate cut was needed for the economy and it would help the housing market, industrials and companies catering to the “less well-off” households.\n\n“There really are two economies in this country. There is the one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it’s harder to find a job and then there is one that says we don’t really care about where the stinking rates are. That’s who we can get a double rate cut today and still going lower.”\n\nCramer said he is currently in Silicon Valley and after talking to many companies, he feels tech companies do not care about interest rates since they are selling to businesses. Cramer said these technology companies are focused on innovation.\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his latest programs on CNBC. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) Jim Cramer’s Top Pick Stock to Buy and Sell?\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 92\n\nWhen asked about Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), Cramer said that Vertiv stock has “come down enough.”\n\n“I’ve had it with the sellers. They’ve got to recognize that the time to sell Vertiv has come and gone.”\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a market leader in the data center power and cooling market, which has nowhere to go but up from here since companies are hungry for data center solutions as they begin to deploy AI software.\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is forming long-term partnerships with Intel and Nvidia to develop tailored solutions for their products. This is especially notable because AI training requires significantly more electricity and produces more heat than traditional servers, driving demand for specialized systems that Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) provides. The company estimates that the additional demand from AI could boost its top-line growth by up to 4% annually.\n\nBy designing products specifically for Nvidia’s GPUs, Vertiv can tap into Nvidia’s growth with minimal effort, as their systems are crucial for optimizing GPU performance. If Nvidia powers data centers with its processors, Vertiv provides the infrastructure that keeps them running efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nVertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) revenue has grown on average at 10% in the most recent quarters. The company has a backlog of over $7 billion, more than a year’s worth of current revenue. Vertiv is targeting a 20% operating margin by 2028.\n\nBaron Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) a leading provider of critical digital infrastructure for data centers, contributed during the quarter. As an industry leader in data center cooling and power management, Vertiv is poised to benefit from AI-driven growth in data center spend. The NVIDIA partner network, strong industry relationships, and broad product portfolio that Vertiv maintains enables its participation in the creation of the technology roadmap for the future of the data center. In addition, Vertiv is investing in its capacity to serve this growing end market more effectively. The company also has an extensive global service network to aid customers as they grow. We believe the company has durable competitive advantages and a flexible balance sheet to benefit from the expected significant capital investment in data centers for years to come. Vertiv reported very strong results for the March quarter, with orders up 60%, which highlighted the strong demand it is seeing for its products. We sold some of our position into strength after the runup from the positive report, but still hold a major position in the Fund as we see considerable upside in the shares over time.”\n\nOverall, Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is Super Micro (SMCI) a $1,000 stock? Wall Street analyst discusses",
        "content": "A Loop Capital analyst adjusted their price target for Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock on Monday, reducing it from $1,500 to $1,000, citing the AI server maker’s efforts to restore its gross margin (GM) and operating margin (OM) to 14% and 10%, respectively, as well as the investors’ concerns regarding the company's delayed 10-K filing.\n\nStill, the analyst believes that the recent speculation of SMCI’s possible demise “is greatly exaggerated and that its importance to the Gen AI server conversation is underappreciated.”\n\nSuper Micro’s 10K filing delay weighs on optimism\n\nSuper Micro in August said it is delaying its annual report filing, citing the need to evaluate \"its internal controls over financial reporting,” leading to a sharp drop in the company’s shares.\n\nThe stock lost nearly 20% in the past month.\n\nThe delay followed a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research revealed it had taken a short position in the company, accusing Super Micro of \"accounting manipulation.\" Since reaching a high in mid-March, SMCI shares have been steadily declining, losing nearly two-thirds of their value after a surge driven by the AI boom.\n\nIt remains unclear if the company’s decision was linked to Hindenburg's report.\n\nThe company also did not revise its previously reported results for the fiscal year and quarter ending June 30. Last month, Super Micro posted a drop in quarterly margins due to rising server production costs and increased competition from rivals such as Dell (NYSE:DELL).\n\nThe company had been a major beneficiary of the generative AI surge, as businesses invested in technology to support applications like ChatGPT. SMCI valuation soared from around $4.4 billion at the start of 2023 to a peak of $67 billion in March.\n\nHowever, the rapid rise of AI stocks has slowed since March, as investors have come to realize that the return on companies' heavy investments may take longer than anticipated.\n\nSuper Micro’s delay in filing its 10-K has prompted several downgrades and price target reductions from Wall Street analysts in recent weeks, further dampening investor sentiment around the stock.\n\nBlackwell to help SMCI’s margins recovery, analyst says\n\nDespite recent headwinds and a price target reduction from $1,500 to $1,000, an analyst at Loop Capital believes it's not all doom and gloom for Super Micro.\n\nAccording to the analyst, SMCI has the potential to achieve over $40 billion in normalized revenue.\n\nConversations with customers indicate a feasible path to returning to a GM of over 14% and an OM of over 10%, with the help of NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) upcoming next-gen GPU architecture, Blackwell. The firm believes that with such revenue growth and margin profiles, SMCI could command a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of at least 20 times, justifying normalized earnings per share (EPS) of $50.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nLoop Capital also presented several \"What If\" scenarios regarding SMCI's future performance.\n\nThese included the possibility of SMCI maintaining its revenue upside for the fiscal 2025 year at $30 billion and regaining GM and OM targets in the next four quarters. The analysis highlights SMCI's continued preference as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) through the Blackwell cycle, which is expected to extend through most of the calendar year 2026.\n\nThe analyst also discussed the competitive landscape, noting that while other Gen AI server vendors are entering the market, they do not “offer the same high-margin services as does SMCI (such as rack integration and tuning)… and the ODM’s look at 3rd-Parties for this capability doesn’t fit the bill.”\n\n“As such, customers currently see paying SMCI an additional GM of 200 – 300bps as the likely outcome for Blackwell, moving GM back to the 14%+ range,” they added.\n\nRegarding the 10-K filing delay, the analyst sees it as a minor hurdle and potentially reflective of a company experiencing rapid growth and focusing on execution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIs Super Micro (SMCI) a $1,000 stock?

        "content": "AMD Chief Predicts Custom Chips Will Outperform GPUs, Sees Shift in AI Chip Demand: Report\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) chief Lisa Su shared insight into the prospects of graphics processing units (GPUs) in the near term, almost to the extent of taking a dig at rival Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and hyperscalers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.\n\nAs AI models become more standardized, there’s potential to create custom chips that offer greater energy efficiency, smaller sizes, and lower costs.\n\nAccording to the WSJ report, Su highlighted this opportunity, noting that while GPUs remain the top choice for large language models due to their efficiency in parallel processing, the future will likely see a shift toward a broader range of chip architectures.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom Stocks Jump, Fed Rate Cut Boosts AI Chip Sector\n\nRecent reports indicated AMD focusing on the mainstream and mid-range GPUs, ditching the premium gaming GPU market led by Nvidia.\n\nNvidia GPUs, designed for gaming graphics, have been instrumental in helping the company reach a trillion-dollar valuation and counting.\n\nTech investor James Anderson expects Nvidia to reach a market cap of $50 trillion within the next decade.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT and CSP Inc. CSPI.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for NVIDIA, Netflix and Applied Materials\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Netflix, Inc. and Applied Materials, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock CSP Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA's shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+138.1% vs. +96.7%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA's revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+44.5% vs. +24.5%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust portfolio, paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\r\n\r\nNetflix added 8.05 million paid subscribers globally in second-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX's leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\r\n\r\nApplied Materials' shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry over the year-to-date period (+19.2% vs. +11.7%). The company is benefiting from strength in the Applied Global Services segment, owing to the growing adoption of the 200-mm system. Solid momentum in the subscription and display businesses is a plus.\r\n\r\nGrowing Semiconductor Systems revenues owing to rebound in the semiconductor industry is a major positive. The company's strength in IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (ICAPS) is likely to continue aiding its position in the semiconductor industry in the days ahead. Its broad-based diversified portfolio remains its key growth driver.\r\n\r\nHowever, softness in the Corporate & Other segment remains a concern. Weakening momentum across Taiwan and Europe is a major negative. Growing geo-political tensions between the United States and China are headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Applied Materials here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of CSP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the year-to-date period (+31.1% vs. +27.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $121.85 million have seen growth driven by its services segment, with a 10% increase in service revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024, improving the gross margin by 150 basis points to 35%.\r\n\r\nThe AZT PROTECT product line offers strong growth potential, with expanding reseller partnerships and integration with companies like Forescout, Ebix and Rockwell. A robust cash position of $28.9 million enhances strategic flexibility. Recurring revenue models, including managed services and UCaaS, support cash flow stability, with UCaaS revenues doubling in fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nCSPI's Technology Solutions division remains resilient, with long-term revenue visibility from IT infrastructure projects. The company's strategic expansion into mid-tier markets, and growing presence in cloud, AI and cybersecurity sectors positions it for growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nPost-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold or Sell NVIDIA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA Corp.has crushed bubble fears and has seen a meteoric rise in the past few years amid the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, however, believes NVIDIA's growth story is just beginning, while the Federal Reserve's recent jumbo interest rate cuts should help the company access cheaper capital. So, is this the most opportune moment to place bets on the stock? Let's take a closer look.\n\nWhy a Rate Cut Will Boost NVIDIA Stock\n\nIn Wednesday's concluded policy meeting, the Fed trimmed interest rates by half a point to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market. For the first time in four years, the Fed eased its monetary policy and kept the interest rates at 4.75% to 5%.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections further showed that most Fed officials expect another 50-basis point rate cut by the end of the year, followed by 100 and 50-basis point rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nA lower interest rate environment bodes well for NVIDIA since the semiconductor behemoth's cash flows essential for growth initiatives aren't affected. At the same time the company's cost of borrowings gets reduced, eventually boosting the profit margins vis-à-vis the share price (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates).\n\nPost-Rate Cut: NVIDIA Stock Beats the S&P 500's Return\n\nNVIDIA stock has always performed well after interest rate cut announcements. As a result, the company's share price increased nearly 4% on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Dow Jones Market Data, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 6.9%, 16.6%, 16.7%, and 20.7% in the month, three months, six months and 12 months following a rate cut.\n\nOn the other hand, going back to the 1990s, the S&P 500 Index, on average, gained only 2.9% in the 12 months after a rate cut, indicating NVIDIA stock has more upside than most of the listed stocks in the broader index.\n\nAnother Reason Why NVIDIA Stock Popped Yesterday\n\nIt's not just the long-awaited big Fed rate cut that pushed the NVIDIA stock higher yesterday. CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging comments on the AI movement at the Dreamforce technological gathering hosted by Salesforce, Inc. also had investors pouring into NVDA stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang said the AI industry is transforming from tools to an industry of skills, and there is a huge opportunity in the field of AI that NVIDIA can exploit. This has given investors all the more reason to believe that NVIDIA's stunning growth isn't over yet. Even though NVIDIA stock has fallen off its record highs, its shares have outpaced the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+138.1% vs +89%).\n\nNVIDIA's advanced chips are needed to train large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini and function AI interfaces. NVIDIA stock, thus, is expected to gain as the AI industry is projected to grow from around $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\n\nMoreover, AI is here to stay as its foundation is based on practical applications, unlike the dot com era when companies were involved in speculative businesses (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\n\n3 Key Reasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock\n\nEncouraging developments on Blackwell chip production, dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market and capability to generate profits consistently also act as tailwinds for the NVIDIA stock.\n\nHuang confirmed that NVIDIA has ramped up the production of cutting-edge Blackwell chips as demand has soared among the likes of Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp.. After all, the Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chip.\n\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA accounts for the bulk of the share in the GPU market as more developers depend on the CUDA software platform, unlike Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s not-so-efficient ROCm software platform. NVIDIA, thus, is well-poised to make the most of the rise in the GPU market, which is likely to expand to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\n\nFundamentally, the NVIDIA stock is sound. This is because its return on equity (ROE) is around 120% compared with the industry's 73.2%. An ROE above 100% indicates that the company's net income is more than the equity or that it has given a strong performance.\n\nNVIDIA Stock is Expensive – Here's How to Trade it\n\nGiven the positives, things are looking brighter for the NVIDIA stock. Prominent brokers have increased NVDA's average short-term price target by 31.3% from the stock's last closing price of $113.37. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 76.4%.\n\nHowever, the NVDA stock is still pricey. Per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock, presently, trades at 42.0X forward earnings. However, NVDA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 16.4X.\n\nTherefore, investors should wait for the right entry point to buy the stock so it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should stick to it since the stock has a strong upside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the biggest investment storylines over the last two years. And while the prospects of AI are lucrative, not every opportunity touching the technology is the same.\n\nWith shares up more than 700% since January 2023, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become one of the biggest names in the AI realm. The company's chipsets, called graphics processing units (GPUs), are a critical component of generative AI development.\n\nAlthough Nvidia has so far emerged as the dominant force in the GPU space, there are a variety of factors that could influence its stock price up or down in the coming years.\n\nLet's explore some important details surrounding Nvidia's business and how they could impact the narrative surrounding Nvidia's growth prospects.\n\nSome short-term catalysts for Nvidia\n\nToday, Nvidia's GPU roster is hallmarked by its A100 and H100 chipsets. The H100 has become a staple for AI development among big tech companies such as Meta Platforms and Tesla.\n\nMoreover, the company's long-awaited new Blackwell series GPUs are finally set to hit the market. Nvidia's management already told investors that Blackwell shipments should drive billions in revenue during the fourth quarter, and shipments should continue into next year. I see the activity surrounding Blackwell as a catalyst for Nvidia and one that should help continue accelerating its revenue and profits.\n\nCorporations of all sizes have been operating under stricter financial controls and smaller budgets over the last couple of years. But the Federal Reserve's recent reduction to interest rates could spur some renewed buying activity in the AI marketplace, and I see Nvidia as a beneficiary from these tailwinds.\n\nAll told, I would not be surprised to see Nvidia stock rise over the next few months. While this may seem encouraging, in the next section, I will break down several factors that could influence Nvidia's share price more materially in the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLonger-term headwinds facing Nvidia\n\nI see three big-ticket items that could put some major pressure on Nvidia over the next few years.\n\n1. Competition: At the moment, Nvidia's direct competition primarily stems from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. While Nvidia has done a good job fending off these cohorts, I'm actually a bit more concerned about the company's tangential competition.\n\n\"Magnificent Seven\" members including Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta are in early stages of developing their own chips and AI training platforms. As I alluded to above, Tesla and Meta are known Nvidia customers. Furthermore, it's long been rumored that Microsoft could be Nvidia's largest customer.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering 46% of its revenue is concentrated among just four customers, I see the ambitious endeavors of these Magnificent Seven peers as a major signal that they are looking to move away from a reliance on Nvidia GPUs and compete directly with the company.\n\nAs more competition enters the chip space, I would not be surprised to see Nvidia's revenue and profitability begin to decelerate materially.\n\n2. Cyclicality: Remember when I said that not all AI opportunities are the same? Technology stocks in general can be cyclical businesses.\n\nEven though chips are one of AI's hottest commodities right now, these demand trends will normalize over time. When you layer the introduction of more chips from the competitors I outlined above, there's a good chance Nvidia's growth will become even more protracted if AI spending in general starts to witness a slowdown.\n\n3. Government: The last concern I'll share about Nvidia is the possibility for government intervention. At the moment, Nvidia is estimated to have 88% share of the GPU market. Moreover, there have been some concerns that Nvidia's tightly integrated system featuring its GPUs and its CUDA software platform helped the company form a monopoly and stifle competition. These allegations could come to a head in the form of a government investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nMy 3-year outlook for Nvidia stock\n\nAlthough the Blackwell launch and a strengthening economy should benefit Nvidia's business (and therefore the stock), I think there are too many hurdles facing the company in the long run to warrant an overwhelmingly bullish outlook.\n\nTo be clear, I don't see Nvidia as a poor investment choice at all. But the combination of rising competition from its own customers, the likelihood of AI spending normalizing, and the possibility of the government taking some action against Nvidia has me thinking the stock will face tougher days over the next few years.\n\nI think if Nvidia's business starts to show consistent signs of deceleration, the company's valuation multiples will start to contract and the stock will lose its premium. For these reasons, I see Nvidia stock valued lower in three years than it is today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Intel (INTC)\n\nChipmaker Intel closed Friday's session more than 3% higher, following reports that rival Qualcomm (QCOM) had approached the company about a possible takeover.\n\n“This would be the biggest deal in the history of the semiconductor industry, ever,” Futurum Group chief market strategist Cory Johnson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe said that while Intel was once the largest semiconductor company in the world, that was no longer the case and that the company was \"still very much wedded to selling chips into PCs because their business is selling chips into the data center has just not worked out.\"\n\n\"They've missed so many product cycles with Nvidia (NVDA) cleaning their clocks in the data center, and that shows no sign of any immediate change,\" Johnson added.\n\nIn addition, Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Apollo Global Management — the parent company of Yahoo — has offered to invest as much as $5bn (£3.8bn) in Intel.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Markets hover as Reeves pledges no return to austerity\n\nIntel has faced challenges this year, having announced in August that it planned to layoff 15,000 employees. The chipmaker also missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings, citing challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to increase production of its AI chips.\n\nHowever, shares ticked higher last week, after Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced in a memo to staff that it had agreed a deal to make custom chips for Amazon's (AMZN) web services business.\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nRupert Murdoch-backed property firm REA Group (REA.AX) has made a third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove, upping its bid to £6.1bn.\n\nIn a statement on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, Rightmove said its board would \"carefully consider\" this increased offer.\n\nRightmove chair Andrew Fisher said: \"Based on the implied value and structure of REA's first and second indicative non-binding proposals, we considered these proposals to be uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected them.\"\n\nHe said the company's board would \"respond to the most recent proposal in due course.\"\n\nOwen Wilson, CEO of REA, said in a statement on the Australian Securities Exchange that the company's increased offer \"provides a combination of immediate value certainty in cash and at the same time gives Rightmove shareholders an increasing opportunity in core digital property and adjacencies where we have much expertise.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"We are genuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove's board and we strongly encourage the Rightmove board to engage,\" he added.\n\nRightmove shares were up nearly 3% on Monday morning, while REA closed its session on the Australian market nearly 3% lower.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While this will certainly be very encouraging for some [Rightmove] investors, who had seen the value of their holdings plummet from highs reached in January 2022, there is likely to be a push among others to hold out for an even better deal.\"\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nFrench lender BNP Paribas (BNP.PA) announced on Monday that it had signed an agreement to buy HSBC's private banking arm in Germany.\n\nBNP said it expected this deal to close during the second quarter of 2025 and that it would bring the bank's assets under management to more than €40bn (£33.4m).\n\nHSBC shares were up more than 1% on Monday morning, while BNP Paribas was down nearly 3%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Sunday that HSBC's exposure to defaulted commercial property loans in Hong Kong had risen by nearly six times in the first half of this year to more than $3.2bn.\n\nRead more: Pound eases against dollar after hitting 30-month high\n\nThe report highlighted how the downturn in commercial property in Hong Kong was starting to impact banks.\n\nA spokesperson for HSBC had not replied to Yahoo Finance UK's request for a response at the time of writing.\n\nCommerzbank (CBK.DE)\n\nThe German government announced on Friday it would keep its 12% stake in the bank. Germany's Finance Agency said that the government would not sell any more shares in Commerzbank \"for the time being\".\n\n\"Commerzbank is a stable and profitable institute. The bank’s strategy is geared towards independence. The Federal government will accompany this until further notice by maintaining its shareholding,\" it said.\n\nReuters reported that the move would likely keep a takeover by UniCredit (UCG.MI) on hold, after the Italian lender said earlier this month that it had increased its share in Commerzbank to 9% and was looking to \"explore value creating opportunities for all stakeholders in both banks.\"\n\nShares in Commerzbank were trading nearly 5% lower on Monday morning, while UniCredit was down close to 2%.\n\nWizz Air (WIZZ.L)\n\nShares in London-listed budget airline Wizz Air dipped more than 1% on Monday morning, after Bloomberg reported that the stock was being targeted by short sellers.\n\nDhares out on loan, which acts a gauge of short-selling interest, accounted for 13% of Wizz Air's stock available for trading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.\n\nBy comparison, that stood at just 1% for rival airlines EasyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair RYA.IR (RYA.IR).\n\nRead more: Pensions and capital gains tax in line for budget tax rises, says IFS\n\nShares in Wizz Air are down 42% year-to-date, with the airline having warned on profits in August.\n\nSathish Sivakumar, an analyst at Citigroup told Bloomberg: “There’s a lot of uncertainty about Wizz’s ability to meet full-year guidance.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Nvidia gets almost half its revenue from just 4 customers. Here's who they might be",
        "content": "When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers.\n\nWhile the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said.\n\n“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing.\n\nNvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one.\n\nHere’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips.\n\nAlphabet Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2017 Conference on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million.\n\n“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion.\n\n“Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said.\n\nAnd while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24.\n\nGoogle announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories.\n\nWith 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities.\n\nIn August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nAmazon Amazon fulfillment center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nMonths after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times.\n\nIn April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan.\n\nWhile Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nIn March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever.\n\nMeta Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April.\n\nMeta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B.\n\nMeta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4.\n\nMicrosoft Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella at CES 2024 on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps.\n\nThe AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.”\n\nMicrosoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said.\n\nTesla Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. - Photo: Christian Marquardt - Pool (Getty Images)\n\nTesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging.\n\n“There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.”\n\nIn September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app.\n\nTesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap.\n\nMusk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.”\n\nOpenAI OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during OpenAI DevDay on November 6, 2023 in San Francisco, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nWhen it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors.\n\nIn September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks.\n\nIn May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This $1 Trillion Opportunity Could Make Nvidia Stock a No-Brainer Buy -- and It's Not Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "It doesn't take an investing genius to know that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a huge winner from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The surging demand for graphics pressing units (GPUs) -- driven largely by AI -- has made Nvidia one of the largest companies on the planet.\n\nCan Nvidia grow even bigger? Yep. The chip giant sees a $1 trillion opportunity ahead -- and it's not AI.\n\nAn unstoppable $1 trillion transition\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in his company's second-quarter earnings call in August, \"[T]he world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing.\" He added later in the call, \"We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing.\"\n\nIs further AI demand needed to facilitate this transition to accelerated computing? Huang doesn't think so.\n\nHe spoke on Sept. 11, 2024, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. In his remarks, Huang imagined a scenario where AI didn't exist. He said, \"Well, in the world where there's no AI at all, general-purpose computing has run out of steam still.\"\n\nHuang argued that \"Moore's Law is over\" -- a reference to the principle espoused by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computers will double every two years. He maintained that the physical limits of fabricating semiconductors will get in the way.\n\nThe solution to the problem in Huang's view, is accelerated computing. And no company beats Nvidia at designing the GPUs required to make accelerated computing possible.\n\nDon't count AI out, though\n\nOf course, we don't live in a hypothetical world where AI doesn't exist. In the real world, AI is accelerating the shift to accelerated computing. Nvidia continues to add fuel to this fire.\n\nThe company's new Blackwell GPU architecture will enable building and running large language models (LLMs) with 1 trillion parameters at up to 25 times lower cost and energy consumption than the current gold standard Hopper platform. Unsurprisingly, Huang said in Nvidia's Q2 earnings call that \"the demand for Blackwell is incredible.\"\n\nBut AI won't just speed up the transition of existing data centers that use general-purpose computing to new ones that use accelerated computing; it will also likely continue to drive the construction of more data centers. These new data centers will be what Nvidia calls \"AI factories\" with data and electricity as raw materials and AI as the product.\n\nStory continues\n\nLook for Nvidia to continue pouring fuel on the fire. The company is now in a \"one-year rhythm\" of introducing new GPU technology. As Huang said earlier this year, [A]fter Blackwell... we have other Blackwells coming.\"\n\nA no-brainer buy?\n\nDoes Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity make the stock a no-brainer buy? Maybe, although it's not a slam dunk.\n\nFor one thing, it could take much longer than Huang envisions for existing data centers to transition to accelerated computing. The surge in AI-related demand could taper off. Nvidia might not capture as much of the data center market as it hopes.\n\nInvestors should also recognize that significant growth prospects are already baked into Nvidia's share price. The stock trades at 29.3 times trailing 12-month sales and 40 times forward earnings.\n\nBut the general premise of Huang's case for Nvidia's $1 trillion opportunity seems reasonable. Whether or not you think Nvidia stock is a no-brainer buy, it should still deliver exceptional gains for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street's Most Anticipated Stock Split of the 4th Quarter May Be Announced This Week",
        "content": "For much of the last two years, Wall Street and investors have been fixated on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. But what they might not realize is how important stock-split euphoria has been for pushing Wall Street's major indexes higher in 2024.\n\nA stock split is a tool public companies have at their disposal that allows them to superficially adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. Splits are surface-scratching in the sense that they don't alter a company's market cap or in any way affect its underlying operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSplits come in two varieties, one of which is undeniably favored by investors. Reverse-stock splits aim to increase a company's share price, often with the purpose of maintaining minimum listing standards for a major stock exchange. Since this is the type of split conducted by struggling businesses, it's one that investors usually avoid.\n\nOn the other hand, forward-stock splits get investors excited. A forward split reduces a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for everyday investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. This type of split is almost always conducted by companies with a rich history of outperforming their peers.\n\nA little over a dozen high-profile stock splits have been announced or completed in 2024, all but one of which is a forward split.\n\nWall Street has flocked to AI stock-split stocks\n\nWith AI stocks in the spotlight, it's no surprise to find that three of Wall Street's most-prominent splits of the year are attached to this highly touted trend:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) completed a historic 10-for-1 forward split in June. Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) closed a 10-for-1 split (its first ever) in mid-July. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) will effect a 10-for-1 split after the close of trading on Sept. 30.\n\nNvidia has been the flagship of the rise of AI and is, arguably, the most-decorated of all stock-split stocks in 2024. Shares of the company have catapulted higher by more than 675% since the start of 2023 due to the dominance of its graphics processing units (GPUs) in AI-accelerated data centers -- an estimated 98% share of GPUs shipped to data centers in 2022 and 2023, according to TechInsights. Demand for its H100 GPU is backlogged, leading to exceptional pricing power and a sizable uptick in the company's gross margin.\n\nBroadcom has quickly slid in as the preferred choice in networking solutions for high-compute data centers. Its solutions are responsible for reducing tail latency and maximizing the computing capacity of GPUs in enterprise data centers training large language models, running generative AI solutions, and making split-second decisions. Although Broadcom is much more than an AI stock, AI is the source of excitement surrounding the company right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for Super Micro Computer, it's become one of the leading infrastructure providers of the AI revolution. Super Micro's customizable rack servers, which incorporate Nvidia's H100 GPUs, are in high demand -- net sales for the company jumped 110% last year -- as businesses look to establish first-mover advantages.\n\nBut while AI stocks have been the bee's knees on Wall Street throughout much of 2024, another brand-name company is perfectly positioned to announce a stock split and steal the spotlight in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis may be the most-anticipated stock split of the fourth quarter\n\nThe stock in question that could set Wall Street abuzz if it announces a forward split later this week is none other than warehouse club Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST).\n\nCostco is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results after the closing bell on Sept. 26, which would be the perfect time to also announce a stock split.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Sept. 18, a single share of Costco was tipping the scales at north of $892. More importantly, the company has conducted only three splits since going public, the last of which occurred all the way back in January 2000. In other words, it looks to be long overdue to make shares more affordable for retail investors and its employees who want to participate in the company's employee stock purchase plan.\n\nThe only logical reason Costco has likely avoided a split for so long -- aside from a greater prevalence of fractional-share purchase capabilities through most online brokers -- is the fact that roughly 72% of its shares are held by institutional investors that aren't concerned about a high nominal share price. But at some point, a near-$900 share price becomes burdensome to its employees and/or everyday investors. I believe we've reached that point with Costco.\n\nFurthermore, Costco's valuation is historically rich. It's currently trading at a multiple of 50 (yes, 50!) times forward-year earnings per share, which is pretty much unheard of for a retailer. The company is going to need some serious buzz if it's to grow into its current valuation, and the first stock split in 24 years might just be what the doctor ordered. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUnmasking Costco's recipe for success\n\nWhile the stage is undeniably set for Costco Wholesale to wow Wall Street with a stock split, the company's underlying operations continue to fire on all cylinders.\n\nCostco's recipe for success begins with the advantage it possesses from its sheer size. Being able to purchase products in bulk helps to lower the per-unit cost of each item. Ultimately, this allows the company to undercut local shops and national grocery chains on price and provide a value proposition to consumers that keeps them coming back.\n\nCostco is also a consumer staples stock. This is to say that it sells a variety of basic need goods that consumers are going to buy regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing, such as food, beverages, and household cleaning/sanitary products. It has a lure to drive traffic into its stores in any economic climate.\n\nAnother key ingredient to Costco's success story is its membership-based operating model. The $65 and $130 annual fees Costco collects from its members is high margin and flows straight to its bottom line. These fees provide an even firmer margin buffer that allows the company to undercut its peers on price to drive membership growth.\n\nLast but not least, paying for an annual membership tends to incent loyalty in shoppers. Consumers will want to get the most out of their membership and are, therefore, more likely to head to Costco for their big-dollar purchases. Getting consumers into its stores is half the battle -- and it's one that Costco has been winning for decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design​. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets – over 20% – to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports indicate that the chip firm has entered into a partnership with United Arab Emirates-based AI company G42 to advance climate technology. The partnership will focus on developing AI solutions aimed at boosting accuracy of weather forecasting globally. Under the deal, per the two firms, a new operational base would be established, along with a Climate Tech Lab in Abu Dhabi, which would serve as a hub for research and development. This facility would also mobilize the creation of tailored climate and weather solutions which use over 100 petabytes of geophysical data assets.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Sebastien Naji recently initiated coverage of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with an Outperform rating. In a research note, the analyst noted that Nvidia had a long and storied history of designing parallel computing systems to handle complex processing tasks, which historically had positioned the chip firm as a leader in niche markets like gaming, automotive, visualization, and high-performance computing, or HPC. However, per Naji, the rising AI tide had catapulted parallel computing to the forefront of the tech industry and had driven massive demand for the company’s GPUs and parallel computing stack.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks were battered over the summer. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which is chock-full of semiconductor stocks that are tied to the AI sector, fell as much as 25% from the all-time high it set in July.\n\nNevertheless, I remain bullish on AI. Investors have only seen the beginning stages of how this technology will reshape the world, and additional innovations will take years and even decades to emerge.\n\nThat is a strong case for owning AI stocks long term -- here are two I find particularly compelling. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe cutting-edge leader in data analytics\n\nTopping my list is PalantirTechnologies (NYSE: PLTR).\n\nThe company, which provides AI-powered big data solutions, is riding high. Earlier this month, it was announced that Palantir would join the S&P 500 index. That news spurred a rally in the stock, which has already climbed by 113% year to date.\n\nBehind that excellent performance is the company's sterling fundamentals. Still a young company, Palantir is primarily focused on growing its customer base and revenue. As of the second quarter, its quarterly revenue increased to $678 million, up 27% from a year earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Palantir's U.S. customer count is growing very rapidly. The company reported 295 American commercial customers last quarter, up 83% year over year. Moreover, Palantir is attracting larger customers as it closed 27 deals worth more than $10 million each during the period.\n\nNeedless to say, Palantir is riding the wave of AI momentum. As CEO Alex Karp noted in his most recent shareholder letter, \"Our growth across the commercial and government markets has been driven by an unrelenting wave of demand from customers for artificial intelligence systems that go beyond the merely performative and academic.\"\n\nIn short, the company has caught the wave and is riding it well. Investors looking for an AI stock to buy and hold for the long term should strongly consider Palantir.\n\nThe foundation of AI innovation\n\nNext on my list of AI stocks is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThat said, Nvidia is a stock I want to buy and hold for the next decade or longer. That's important because I've made no secret of my opinion that the stock has become very expensive.\n\nHowever, I still view it as a strong buy because AI is a long-term trend that will play out over many years. In the same way the internet continues to evolve, AI has a long road ahead of it.\n\nThat's great news for Nvidia, in particular, because its product is the go-to solution when it comes to building the \"brains\" of various AI models. It makes the graphic processing units (GPUs) most favored by AI developers\n\nStory continues\n\nThe red-hot demand for AI-capable GPUs means Nvidia can charge top dollar for its products, including the H100 and its soon-to-debut Blackwell chip.\n\nIt's important to remember why Nvidia's stock has surged more than 600% over the last two years: The company's revenue and profits are exploding. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIn its most recent quarter (ended July 28), revenue was $30.0 billion, up 122% from a year earlier. Over the last 12 months, the company has generated $96.3 billion in sales, up from $25.7 billion less than two years ago. Profits have similarly surged.\n\nThe company's dominant position in AI has driven its share price to new heights, but even following its incredible two years of gains, Nvidia remains an AI stock I want to own for the next decade and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market is going like gangbusters as businesses and individuals flock to generative AI systems including Alphabet's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT platform. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the generative AI market is \"poised to explode\" from a market size of just $40 billion in 2022 to $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nHow can you position your portfolio to take advantage of that? These two stocks are your best bets right now.\n\nThe pick-and-shovel play in AI\n\nDuring the California gold rush of the 1800s, the majority of prospectors made little to no money, but the shopkeepers around them did quite well. Thus, the adage was born: \"During a gold rush, sell shovels.\" If this strategy fits with your investment style, your AI bets must include Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nRight now, few companies are as important to the AI industry as Nvidia. It sells some of the most advanced GPUs (graphics processing units) on the market -- specialized chips capable of handling heavy computing loads through parallel processing. That's an essential capability for the servers that train and power AI models. Whether the use case is image recognition, natural language processing, or autonomous driving, AI systems require huge volumes of GPUs to function, and more will be needed to meet the growing demand for those AI services. According to various estimates, Nvidia is supplying between 70% and 95% of the world's AI chips.\n\nOf course, other chipmakers are not ignoring Nvidia's success. As CEO Jensen Huang recently said, \"I don't think people are trying to put me out of business. I probably know they're trying to, so that's different.\" Intel and AMD are aggressively expanding their chip manufacturing capabilities, while start-ups like D-Matrix aim to shake up the market with new components that dramatically reduce the computing load AI models require. As was the case during previous chip wars, it's far from certain which companies will win over the long term. Right now, however, Nvidia has a dominant lead. Any bet on the rise of AI should start with the company supplying its most critical components. But if you're looking for maximum upside, the stock below might be a better pick.\n\nThis voice recognition company's stock has even more upside\n\nNvidia is a great bet for those bullish on AI. But with a market cap north of $2.7 trillion, it's likely that the company's biggest days of growth are behind it. Looking for a company whose best days are ahead of it? Look no further than SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN).\n\nCompared to Nvidia, SoundHound AI is tiny, with a market cap of just $1.7 billion. But with an addressable market that is already worth more than $140 billion, it has a clear pathway to grow immensely. However, there are some serious risks for investors to consider before jumping into its stock.\n\nSoundHound's specialty is integrating AI into systems that can engage in verbal conversation with people. Its voice recognition and language processing technology is already in use across a variety of industries, allowing people to chat with their vehicles about maintenance issues or order fast food through an AI chatbot, for example. Major names like Hyundai and Applebee's are already SoundHound AI clients.\n\nWith a growing list of customers and a portfolio of more than 200 patents, SoundHound AI could be a major player in the artificial intelligence space this decade. Yet that naturally leads to the question of why its valuation is still stuck below $2 billion.\n\nFirst, SoundHound AI may not have the capital necessary to compete with the tech giants that are also investing heavily in its niche. Its research and development budget of only $56 million per year, for example, is dwarfed by the budgets of competitors like IBM and Alphabet. So it's not clear if SoundHound's lead is sustainable.\n\nSecond, the company is still losing money. Last quarter, it posted its biggest loss in history. That will be less of a problem if additional capital remains cheap and accessible. But if the market turns its back on SoundHound, that would hinder its already limited ability to compete head-to-head with better-financed companies.\n\nIf SoundHound does succeed, there could be massive upside for patient shareholders. But there are major downside risks here as well. This is much more of a boom-or-bust investment than Nvidia, and is suitable only for aggressive investors seeking maximum upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Just Sold 9.3 Million Shares of Nvidia and Bought This Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That's Headed to the S&amp;P 500 Instead",
        "content": "From sifting through investor presentations and corporate filings to listening to earnings calls and watching interviews, getting a firm gauge on an investment often requires a lot of work.\n\nOne thing that I like to do is analyze 13F filings. These are forms filed by investment firms managing over $100 million in stocks. One of the more high-profile hedge funds is Ken Griffin's Citadel. Last quarter, Citadel reduced its stake in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by 79% -- dumping 9,282,018 shares. In addition, the firm increased its position by 1,140% in Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), scooping up 5,222,682 shares.\n\nLet's dig into what may have compelled Griffin and his portfolio managers to sell Nvidia and buy Palantir. Moreover, I'll explore what catalysts could help fuel even more growth for Palantir -- and why now could be a great time to follow Griffin's lead.\n\nWhy sell Nvidia right now?\n\nOn the surface, selling Nvidia stock might look like a questionable move. After all, isn't artificial intelligence (AI) the next big thing?\n\nWell, even if AI ends up being the generational opportunity it's being touted to be, that doesn't mean a whole lot at face value. There are many components to the foundations of AI, and Nvidia's expertise in the development of advanced chipsets called graphics processing units (GPU) is just one of many building blocks supporting artificial intelligence.\n\nThe biggest bear narrative surrounding Nvidia stems from rising competition. At present, products developed by Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are the most obvious alternatives to Nvidia. However, I see a bigger risk in the competitive landscape.\n\nNamely, Nvidia's big tech cohorts including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Amazon are all investing heavily into their own hardware development. Considering that many of these companies are Nvidia's own customers, I'm wary that the company's current growth trajectory is sustainable in the long run.\n\nWhen more GPUs come to market, there is a good chance this technology will be viewed as somewhat commoditized. Such a dynamic will likely lead to lower prices for Nvidia, which will subsequently bring decelerating revenue, margins, and profits.\n\nAll told, I don't really blame Griffin for selling such a large portion of his Nvidia position. Despite the company's success so far, its future prospects look potentially questionable. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy buy Palantir right now?\n\nIn a different area of the AI landscape sits enterprise software company Palantir. It offers four data analytics platforms called Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP. The company's software is used across a host of use cases throughout the U.S. military and private sector.\n\nStory continues PLTR Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nInvestors can see that over the last couple of years, Palantir's revenue accelerated on the backdrop of a bullish AI narrative. More importantly, the company's operating leverage has improved dramatically in the form of margin expansion and consistent profitability.\n\nEarlier this month, Palantir also achieved the notable milestone of inclusion in the S&P 500.\n\nShould you buy Palantir stock right now?\n\nI can't say for certain why Griffin increased his stake in Palantir so much last quarter, but I do find the timing interesting for one particular reason. Palantir has been eligible for the S&P 500 before but was not initially chosen. Perhaps some thought Palantir's newfound growth was purely an extension of demand for AI software and would not be sustainable in the long run.\n\nWhatever the case, I think those who have followed Palantir for a long time understood that the company's long-run prospects looked solid -- regardless of the current AI narrative. Bearing that in mind, it was reasonable to think that the company would be included in the S&P 500 eventually.\n\nThis leads me to a broader point. Now that Palantir is in the S&P 500, there is a good chance more investment banks and research analysts will begin following the company more closely. In turn, this could lead to an increase in institutional investors buying the stock. Over time, this could strengthen Palantir's brand and perception in the investment community and bring the stock to even higher prices.\n\nI think there is a good chance Palantir will witness a rise in institutional ownership. The company is quickly emerging as a force in the AI software arena, and has even attracted the likes of Microsoft and Oracle -- two relationships that I think will bring even further growth to the company.\n\nI very much see even better days ahead for Palantir, and think now is a great time to buy shares. With so many catalysts fueling the company's upside, I see Griffin swapping Nvidia for Palantir as a particularly savvy move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's CEO Keeps Selling Shares: Is It a Red Flag?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has already soared 2,420% over the past five years, but Wall Street is still overwhelmingly bullish on its future. Out of the 64 analysts who cover the chipmaker, 51 rate its stock as a buy, nine rate it as overweight, and four rate it as a hold. Not a single analyst has given it a dreaded underweight or sell rating.\n\nBut over the past 12 months, Nvidia's insiders actually sold more than 10 times as many shares as they bought. One of those major sellers was its own CEO Jensen Huang, who liquidated nearly 6 million shares from June 13 through mid-September. Should investors follow Huang's lead, or should they tune out that noise and keep holding the stock? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow many shares does Jensen Huang own?\n\nAs of Sept. 16, Huang still directly held 75.4 million shares of Nvidia. At $116 per share, that personal stake is worth $8.75 billion. However, Huang also indirectly owns another 785.6 million shares of Nvidia across five other trusts and a partnership. Those combined shares account for the lion's share of his net worth of over $100 billion.\n\nIn other words, Huang's liquidation of 6 million shares -- worth about $700 million today -- represents a tiny percentage of his total stake in Nvidia. All of Huang's recent sales were also made through a trading plan, which he adopted on March 14 to automatically execute stock trades whenever certain market conditions are met.\n\nThose exact trading conditions aren't publicly known, but they're usually based on technical factors like a stock's price and trading volume. Those automated plans are designed to prevent insiders from placing trades with nonpublic information.\n\nHuang also receives most of his salary as stock awards. Some $26.68 million of his $34.17 million in compensation in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) was paid out in Nvidia's shares instead of cash. So Huang might simply be selling some of those shares to raise more cash -- and those sales don't necessarily mean Nvidia's stock is overvalued.\n\nWhat should investors focus on instead?\n\nJensen Huang is clearly invested in Nvidia's future, and the chipmaker still has a bright future. The rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market is driving more companies to buy more of its data center GPUs to process complex machine learning and AI tasks, and that feverish demand continues to outstrip its available supply.\n\nIn the first half of fiscal 2025, Nvidia generated a whopping 87% of its revenue from its data center chips -- compared to 78% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 and just 39% of its revenue in fiscal 2022. That rapid expansion turned Nvidia into an all-in AI play and significantly reduced the importance of its PC gaming GPU business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you believe Nvidia will continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, then its stock could have plenty of room to run. From fiscal 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to continue expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 56%. At 41 times this year's earnings, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those explosive growth rates.\n\nBut Nvidia could struggle to match those expectations as it faces more competitive, regulatory, and macro headwinds. Advanced Micro Devices is gradually gaining a foothold in the data center market with its cheaper GPUs, and many tech giants are developing their own AI chips to gradually curb their dependence on Nvidia. U.S. regulators could further tighten their export restrictions to completely block its remaining chip sales to China, while an unexpected recession could cause many of its top customers to rein in their AI spending. Those challenges could throttle Nvidia's growth and end its historic rally.\n\nIgnore the noise and focus on the facts\n\nJensen Huang's stock sales are attracting a lot of attention from the bears, but it's just a lot of sound and fury that signifies nothing. So instead of following his lead, investors should weigh the pros and cons to see if it's still worth buying. I think Nvidia's stock could head even higher over the next few years as the AI market expands, but investors should temper their expectations, stay patient, and recognize its potential long-term challenges.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offers up this reminder to investors before his big birthday",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI think I have fully processed my time spent at Salesforce's (CRM) annual extravaganza in San Francisco, known as Dreamforce.\n\nThis was my fourth Dreamforce, and it was fascinating per usual — including a dinner at the top of the 61-floor Salesforce Tower with Matthew McConaughey (a longtime friend and pitchman for the SaaS giant), Will.i.Am, Metallica lead drummer Lars Ulrich, one of Nvidia's (NVDA) founding GPU creators, and Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei (who gave some great brief remarks on artificial intelligence).\n\nThis dinner ended with an acoustic performance by Alanis Morissette, who sang four songs that reminded me that, at one point over the last 42 years, I did have a personal life (filled with the teenage heartbreak that only fed my appetite for sappy Alanis songs on Myspace).\n\nI digress.\n\nNow that I've digested this latest West Coast tech swing, I'm here to say it's good to see Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff back to being Marc Benioff.\n\nI realize that as a journalist, I'm supposed to be critical, and I am. Salesforce shocked the hell out of the market in late May with a weak outlook, and the stock got hammered. Not a lovely look.\n\nBut I can't completely turn off the analyst DNA in me that still exists deep down.\n\nAnd on that score, I liked what I saw from Benioff at Dreamforce from a few different perspectives.\n\nI saw a founder pull thousands of employees into his vision of an AI future during a keynote. The room full of \"trailblazers\" — as Salesforce employees are called — was hanging on to his every word. The group was ready to run through a wall for Benioff, essential when you are trying to deploy a billion autonomous AI agents and deliver for Wall Street each quarter.\n\nIt was also significant that Benioff mostly did the keynote himself, only yielding the mic a few times.\n\n\"The reason is I think he feels that this is a very pivotal moment for his company, for the industry, and for the technology,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan — who was also in attendance — told me.\n\n\"When these entrepreneurs like Marc and Oracle's Larry Ellison that have founded their companies and have this deep sense of connection to the companies, and they understand those pivotal moments, it is like they kick into high gear and all they can think about is getting the company to be on the right side of technology.\"\n\nStory continues Salesforce co-founder & CEO Marc Benioff gives his keynote address at Dreamforce 2024. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nI saw a founder deeply engaged in the products he was pitching to the masses — not reading off talking points supplied by team members. Benioff even turned the tables and quizzed me on the Opening Bid podcast about what I learned from a product demo at the event. You can catch that exchange in the above video.\n\nIf he thought he was going to catch this fella flat-footed, hell no! Forever prepared!\n\nI saw a founder perhaps doing what very few in corporate America could do: bring together huge names to drive meaningful discussions, which often transformed into convos about Salesforce innovations and their longtime personal ties with Benioff.\n\nBenioff has one of the most extensive networks I've seen, and trust me, that has paid dividends for Salesforce in terms of reputation, business wins, and getting things done quickly.\n\n\"Marc can turn this ship like no one else when he gets an idea in his head,\" one Benioff confidant told me at the Salesforce Tower dinner.\n\nBy all indications, Benioff is back to aggressively driving that huge Salesforce boat — shaking off the activist attacks that transpired a little while back.\n\n\"If I'm not enjoying it — I'm not doing it, and I think that I'm really enjoying Salesforce. I love it. I feel like we've done seminal work, especially in the last 18 months. We've gotten the company to the point where it is an absolute leader, where everyone is having to respond,\" Benioff remarked when asked to reflect ahead of his big 60th birthday on Sept. 25.\n\nSo all this raises the question: Why isn't there more optimism priced into Salesforce's stock?\n\nIts shares trade on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. Microsoft (MSFT) trades at 33 times, whereas Oracle (ORCL) (Ellison is a mentor of Benioff's dating back to his time at the company) is at 27 times. Salesforce quasi-rival ServiceNow (NOW) trades on a 53 times forward multiple.\n\nPros tell me the Street is generally worried about Salesforce's propensity to spend big on acquisitions, which weighed on margins and free cash flow in the past. Others still aren't sold on Salesforce monetizing its new AI initiatives.\n\nBut they all generally agree that the stock does appear cheap on a relative and historical basis.\n\n\"I would go far enough to say that not much optimism [at all] is being priced into Salesforce's stock right now,\" Rangan said. \"The stock is pricing in as if there is no growth at all, which is absolutely ridiculous. So not only AI optimism is not priced in, there's no optimism being priced in.\"\n\nSalesforce's guidance calls for sales growth of 7% this year and up to 25% operating cash flow growth, FYI.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic about this company,\" Rangan said. \"People tend to dismiss Marc — but I'm a big bull on the company.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Buying Back Their Own Shares Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are some of the hottest names on Wall Street. But did you know that many of these stocks also boast significant share buyback programs?\n\nToday, let's examine three such stocks: MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta's strong free cash flow fuels its massive share buyback program.\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms): My choice is Meta Platforms, thanks to its $50 billion share buyback program and fantastic free cash flow.\n\nWhy do I link the share buyback and free cash flow? Well, if share buyback programs were airplanes, free cash flow would be their fuel.Simply put, a buyback plan would crash and burn without ample free cash flow.That's because companies use free cash flow to fund their buyback plans.\n\nThankfully, Meta is awash in cash profits. Over the last 12 months, the company has reported $49 billion in free cash flow, or $18.83/share. Over the last five years, Meta has increased its free cash flow by 154%. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMeta has achieved this incredible cash flow thanks to its asset-light business model. The company's average operating margin over that five-year period is an outstanding 35% -- topping other internet giants like Alphabet (27%) and Netflix (20%).\n\nWhat's more, as the digital ad market continues to expand, Meta's revenue -- and subsequently its free cash flow -- should expand, too. Analysts expect Meta's revenue to rise to $165 billion in 2025, up roughly 14% from this year.\n\nIn turn, the company's cash pile should grow even larger. It stands at $58 billion, although the company also has about $38 billion in debt. Nevertheless, Meta has more than enough cash profits to cover its new dividend and share buyback program.\n\nThe dividend, introduced this year and first paid out in May, has cost the company about $2.5 billion this year. The total cost should rise to roughly $10 billion per year. That leaves Meta plenty of cash to keep buying back stock.\n\nShareholders have 60 billion reasons to like this share buyback\n\nWill Healy(Microsoft): Software giant Microsoft has long stood out for its Windows OS and Azure cloud platform. As the world's second-largest publicly traded company, it is used to going big and also plans to do so with its cash reserves.\n\nTypically, its 10% dividend increase might constitute such a move by itself. However, that adds less than $2.2 billion to its dividend costs. What is likely more significant is it also approved a share repurchase program valued at up to $60 billion!\n\nWhile that sounds massive, investors should put that into perspective. For one, it's a multi-year plan and Microsoft could revoke the plan at any time. The company has not guaranteed that it will spend the entire amount on buying back shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the number of outstanding shares stands at just over 7.4 billion. Even if it spends the entire $60 billion allotment on share repurchases at today's share price, that will remove just under 138 million shares from the market, less than 1.9% of the shares currently available.\n\nStill, this likely tells investors how Microsoft will deploy much of its liquidity, which stands at a staggering $75.5 billion. With that cash, it can easily afford share buybacks, $24 billion in annual dividend expenses, and the costs of servicing its $45 billion in total debt.\n\nAnother factor that will help bankroll the repurchases is the approximate $74 billion Microsoft generated in free cash flow for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). Thanks to the popularity of Azure and its funding of privately held OpenAI, Microsoft has access to some of the latest technology in the AI field.\n\nAs more of its clients seek to leverage AI, Microsoft stock should find itself in a virtuous cycle. Not only will its free cash flow probably rise, but it will also help fund the share buybacks and, by extension, the price growth that will continue to draw more investors to Microsoft stock.\n\nA ramped-up buyback program could be a taste of what's to come.\n\nJustin Pope (Nvidia): AI's arrival on Wall Street last year has turned Nvidia into one of the world's largest companies. This business went from less than $30 billion in annual revenue to an estimated $125 billion in Nvidia's fiscal year ending this January. Companies are investing heavily to build the computing capacity to support AI applications, and the trend is poised to continue, with Nvidia getting set to roll out Blackwell, its next-generation AI chip line.\n\nNvidia is highly profitable, converting roughly half its revenue into free cash flow. That means the company could end its fiscal year generating over $60 billion in cash profits. Management hasn't wasted any time putting that cash to work; the company announced a $50 billion share repurchase program at the end of August with Q2 earnings. Share repurchases, or buybacks, lower the amount of outstanding shares, boosting earnings per share and other per-share financials. It's a way for a company to support its stock price while sharing its profits with investors.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is more than 15% off its high and trading at a forward P/E of 41 using analyst earnings estimates for this year. Analysts believe Nvidia could grow earnings by over 40% annually for the next three to five years, so Nvidia appears attractively valued for its expected growth.\n\nThat's an excellent situation for a company to consider repurchasing stock. Buybacks create more value for shareholders when the stock's valuation makes sense. The lower the price, the more shares the buybacks can afford, and the higher earnings (and the stock price) go. Nvidia's AI success gets all the hype, but don't underestimate the role buybacks could play in Nvidia's investment returns over the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The hottest stock in the market over the past couple of years has been Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advanced, Nvidia capitalized, having prepared for this revolution over the past two decades.\n\nBut after Nvidia's stratospheric rise, several major hedge funds and technology-focused mutual funds recently took some or all of their Nvidia chips (pun intended) off the table. Here are three major investors who got out before this summer's swoon.\n\nBaillie Gifford trims its largest position\n\nPerhaps the most \"bullish\" sale of Nvidia stock last quarter came from one of its biggest supporters, Baillie Gifford. The $128.4 billion mutual fund based in Edinburgh, Scotland, is regarded as one of the best technology growth stock investors in the world.\n\nIn the second quarter, Baillie sold a whopping 21 million shares in Nvidia, decreasing its position by 20.3%.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Nvidia shareholders should panic. Nvidia remained Baillie's largest holding, at 7.9% of its portfolio, even after this big trim. Many mutual funds have caps on the size of positions they can take, and many portfolio managers tend to rebalance after a holding appreciates to a big allocation. That appears to be what's happening here.\n\nSo, investors may not be concerned over Baillie slashing its Nvidia stake.\n\nDavid Tepper's Appaloosa sells most of its stake\n\nPerhaps more bearish than Baillie was the big 84% hack to Appaloosa Management's Nvidia position.\n\nAppaloosa is run by the legendary value investor David Tepper, who was one of the top-performing hedge fund managers of his generation. After founding Appaloosa in 1993, Tepper compounded his investors' wealth by a staggering 40% over the next 20 years.\n\nAppaloosa did benefit handsomely from its Nvidia holding through the first quarter of 2024, as it had been a top 10 position for the hedge fund in the first quarter. However, it appears Tepper and his team slashed that stake by 84% in Q2, lowering the allocation from 5.91% at the end of Q1 to just a 1.38% position as of June 30. Nvidia went from a top 10 holding to the 25th–largest position out of just 37 long positions. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInterestingly, Tepper still appears to believe in technology and AI, as his top positions include Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) and several other Magnificent Seven stocks. So, this big trim may have been either valuation-related or that Tepper potentially sees competition for Nvidia on the horizon. After all, he also holds Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) in a larger allocation now, which has come out with its MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) this year, as well as all the major cloud infrastructure players now designing their own accelerators for AI in-house.\n\nStory continues\n\nElliot Management sells out: It doesn't believe the hype\n\nFinally, massive $75 billion hedge fund Elliott Management also had a position in Nvidia in the first half of 2024. However, this fund, which specializes in value investing and activist investing situations, soured on the stock big-time.\n\nInterestingly, Elliott bought the stock in Q1, but just a toe-dip at a minuscule 0.03% allocation. However, it appears Elliott's portfolio managers had a change of heart and thought even that was too much, with Elliott liquidating its entire position by the end of Q2.\n\nNot only that, Elliot said in its second-quarter letter that it doesn't really believe AI will be all that transformative, noting there are few relevant use cases of AI other than \"summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.\"\n\nNow that's a buzzkill and is at odds with what we are hearing from most technology CEOs, who expect improved usefulness as AI models improve. But Elliott took the hate one step further, with its biggest long position at the end of Q2 in put options on the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) -- essentially a bet against the tech sector. That seemed prescient, as tech stocks had a big pullback over the summer. Meanwhile, none of the company's top 25 long positions are in technology, with the bulk in energy and financials.\n\n3 distinct risks\n\nIn the second quarter, we saw three different flavors of Nvidia sales. Baillie's sale appears to be mere risk management after a lot of out-performance, but still with a key belief in Nvidia as a winner going forward. Appaloosa's sale seems to indicate a preference for less expensive technology names that may begin to make competitive inroads against Nvidia in the age of AI. But Elliott's sale and commentary indicate a total lack of belief in the hype around AI, with a preference for more unloved sectors of the market.\n\nWhich view will prove correct? It largely comes down to how useful AI ultimately becomes as the technology progresses and whether Nvidia's multiple competitors are able to breach its formidable moat. As they say, only time will tell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before 2025",
        "content": "Companies that split their stocks are usually experiencing phenomenal growth that has sent their share price soaring. It's not uncommon to see a fast-growing company issue multiple stock splits over several years. For example, leading chip supplier Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock six times in the last 25 years, with two since 2021.\n\nThe most common type of split is a forward stock split in which the goal of the company is to make its share price more affordable for investors. Keep in mind, a stock split gives you more shares, but the share price is also reduced so that the value of your investment remains the same after the split.\n\nStock splits alone are not a good reason to invest in a company. It still comes down to looking at a company's growth and future opportunities. If the stock is trading at a reasonable price relative to that growth, you've got a winner on your hands. Here are two growth stocks that recently issued a 10-for-1 split you can buy today with less than $200.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks over the last 10 years. The shares are up 24,000% since 2014. The company has split its stock twice in the last five years: a 4-for-1 split in 2021 followed by a 10-for-1 split in June of this year, bringing its share price to a more affordable $118.\n\nThe stock has been choppy over the last month as investors focus on near-term hurdles to growth. Nvidia is launching its Blackwell GPU architecture later than Wall Street expected. Nvidia is also dealing with export restrictions and increasing competition in China, although its China business grew sequentially last quarter.\n\nSome of Nvidia's largest customers in the U.S. are making their own chips for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, including Amazon Web Services (AWS). There is growing demand for alternatives since Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in short supply and command high selling prices.\n\nDespite these risks, Nvidia's revenue grew 122% year over year in the fiscal second quarter. There is currently no replacement for the general-purpose computing power of Nvidia's GPUs. This is why Amazon and other cloud service providers are expected to adopt Blackwell next year, which can run large language models (LLMs) significantly faster and at lower cost than previous-generation chips.\n\nNvidia expects fiscal Q3 revenue to be up approximately 79% over the year-ago quarter. Management sees the enterprise AI wave gaining momentum across various industries, and this should lead to strong demand for Blackwell starting in fiscal Q4.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts currently expect Nvidia's earnings to increase 40% to $3.99 next year. Assuming Nvidia stock is trading at the same price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the stock could reach $200 by the end of 2025, representing an upside of 69%.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is another chip stock that has delivered exceptional returns to investors in recent years. This leading supplier of networking and software solutions for data centers issued a 10-for-1 forward split on July 15, bringing its share price down to $167.\n\nBroadcom is well-positioned for long-term growth in the AI market. It started investing in AI around 10 years ago, and it's paying off. In Q2, revenue from custom AI accelerators grew over threefold compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnother catalyst that should benefit the stock is Broadcom's smartphone business. It has been a key component supplier for Apple. As part of Apple's commitment to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over the next five years, it made a long-term deal with Broadcom in 2023 to supply wireless connectivity and other components for Apple devices.\n\nBroadcom could see modest upside from Apple's iPhone 16 over the next year. Apple is expected to experience strong demand for its new iPhones, given that customers with older phones will need to upgrade to take advantage of new AI features coming to iOS. Broadcom expects 20% sequential growth in wireless revenue in Q4.\n\nAnalysts are high on Broadcom right now, since some of the risks to the business have already materialized, such as the recent sluggishness in smartphone sales. Plus, it's got great exposure to the growth in AI infrastructure, which bodes well for its long-term prospects.\n\nThe stock is trading at a forward P/E of 27 on next year's earnings estimate, and analysts expect the company to post annualized earnings growth of 19% over the long term. The stock should deliver excellent returns for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stocks That Could Soar in 2025, According to This Metric",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have rocketed higher this year. But these companies are benefiting from powerful trends in data center spending and digital advertising that could send their share prices to new highs in 2025.\n\nThese stocks trade at relatively low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios compared to Wall Street's 2025 earnings estimates, which could set up another monster run for investors next year. Here's how these stocks can deliver.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia continues to report phenomenal growth, as data centers transition from traditional computing to accelerated computing systems to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) has been off the charts, which sent the stock up 161% over the last year.\n\nThe stock's forward P/E is 28 based on next year's earnings estimate, which is too low, given Wall Street's estimate calling for 40% earnings growth next year and 36% over the next several years. The stock currently trades at a P/E of 53 on trailing-12-month earnings. If the stock is trading at the same trailing P/E and Nvidia stays on track to meet next year's earnings estimate, the share price could climb over $200.\n\nThe stock pulled back over the last month amid concerns about the delay of Nvidia's new Blackwell computing platform. But demand trends look very favorable. Management expects to begin generating revenue from Blackwell in the fourth quarter, and that will be additive to demand for its current-generation chip.\n\nImportantly, management pointed to a variety of workloads driving growth for its data center business. Customers are buying its hardware for generative AI model training and inferencing, in addition to development of cutting-edge AI models. Demand is coming from consumer internet services and thousands of start-ups building AI applications across healthcare, advertising, and education.\n\nNvidia stock was trading at a similar P/E in December before the stock doubled in 2024. The current valuation suggests it could repeat that performance again as it launches Blackwell.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nDigital advertising is making up a growing share of total ad spending, and this continues to fuel growth for Facebook owner Meta Platforms. The social media stock is up more than 80% over the last 12 months, but still trades at a very attractive valuation that can support more gains in 2025.\n\nMeta shares trade at a forward P/E of 22 on next year's earnings estimates. This is well below Meta's average P/E over the last 10 years of 38. The stock could climb as much as 50% if the stock's P/E closes some of that gap. Analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 17% over the long term, which justifies a higher P/E.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has a long runway of growth in digital advertising, and the company's investments in AI will help unlock that potential. In early 2023, Meta announced Llama, a large language model that can interpret a string of words to complete a text. It's already released Llama version 3.1, which is having an impact on its revenue growth.\n\nLlama is the technology behind Meta AI, a personal assistant that has improved the user experience on Meta's social media platforms. Meta AI is driving higher user engagement and upside in advertising revenue. Meta's revenue grew 22% year over year in Q2.\n\nGiven the growth opportunity, Meta plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure. Meta is a highly profitable business with $49 billion in free cash flow. It can afford to invest aggressively in AI and gain a technological edge. Given these advantages, the stock seems conservatively valued and deserving of a higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It's an understatement to say that Wall Street analysts are bullish on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nFactSet tracks 64 analyst ratings on the chip designer's stock. And 51 of them rate Nvidia a buy in that system -- the highest available grade, equivalent to a strong buy on most rating platforms. Nine more call Nvidia an overweight opportunity, and the last four have settled for a hold. None of the 64 financial firms are going below that level.\n\nThe consensus price target stands at $149 per share, 29% above Nvidia's current share price. Long story short, analysts absolutely love the stock, and they highly recommend buying into it in the current market.\n\nI'm not so sure, though. Let me tell you why.\n\nWhy I'm holding Nvidia shares but not buying more\n\nDon't get me wrong: I own a couple of Nvidia shares and have no intention of selling them any time soon. As long as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has legs, Nvidia will be a front-runner for every contract regarding high-performance AI accelerator chips.\n\nThis is the hardware designer behind most of today's leading large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's groundbreaking ChatGPT system. These bona fides are more than enough to keep Nvidia relevant for years to come.\n\nBut I am not interested in buying more Nvidia shares today, and it's probably a better idea to trim your holdings if you saw big gains on them over the last two years.\n\nIn fact, I took that step in February, locking down a 320% gain on about half of my Nvidia positions over a span of 20 months. It wasn't a perfectly timed sell, but market timing never works anyway.\n\nNvidia's stock has gained 77% since then, and I don't mind missing out. I'm just happy to have reinvested some of my Nvidia winnings in more promising growth stocks, shielding the majority of that winning investment from potential price drops.\n\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised to see some steep Nvidia price cuts from this lofty valuation.\n\nThe risks Wall Street might be ignoring\n\nAgain, Wall Street's finest professionals either disagree with me or are willing to take the risk. That fact doesn't change my Nvidia analysis. Stock market analysts are not always right, despite their years of experience and access to expensive analytical tools.\n\nIn this case, lots of investors are shrugging off the company's competition. At the same time, the stock continues to trade at incredibly rich valuation ratios. That's a bad combination -- Nvidia's market makers are ignoring serious risks that really should keep a lid on the stock's valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat kind of competition is the company facing? I can't cover every base, but here's a quick overview of a few interesting challengers and how they stand apart from Nvidia's products:\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has its Instinct series of AI accelerators, currently led by the MI300 chip. These processors offer number-crunching performance comparable to Nvidia's finest, but with a higher memory capacity and lower price per unit. Many cheap processors can outperform a smaller batch of better but more expensive ones. The Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi 3 AI accelerator comes with higher performance per watt and more modest requirements for cooling. Power efficiency is a big deal, so this advantage could be the final straw that seals the chip order. The recently announced IBM(NYSE: IBM) Spyre AI accelerator was designed to add AI features to Big Blue's mainframe servers. Expected to launch in 2025, this product will upgrade traditional mainframe workloads with high-performance AI features. Mobile chip leader Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is building AI accelerators into its latest and greatest smartphone and tablet processors. This company attacks the AI opportunity from a very different angle than Nvidia's back-end focus, arguably making it more of a partner than a rival. Still, Qualcomm's mobile chips will probably steal workloads away from Nvidia's more centralized and cloud-based computing clients, thus winning design dollars that otherwise could have landed in Nvidia's coffers.\n\nMoreover, many of these AI-accelerator rivals also compete with Nvidia for manufacturing capacity. AMD, IBM, and Qualcomm all rely on the same third-party chip foundries to turn their designs into physical chips, often butting heads with Nvidia's chipmaking capacity requests. Intel prefers its own chip manufacturing facilities, which could give old Chipzilla a practical advantage if AI chip orders ever overwhelm the usual manufacturing specialists.\n\nWhy Nvidia might face a price correction\n\nIt's easy to imagine a world where one or more of these household-name alternatives carve out lucrative niches in the AI accelerator market, undermining Nvidia's early lead along the way. Furthermore, many market watchers have started asking questions about how valuable the generative AI services are to the consumers and corporate clients found at the other end of Nvidia's revenue funnel. What if this booming AI market turns out to be a poppable bubble?\n\nThese risks might not amount to much, but then Nvidia seems poised for a price correction on the slightest of competitor wins or total market slowdowns. The stock trades at 30 times sales and 62 times free cash flow -- valuation ratios normally reserved for fast-growing software companies.\n\nI'm not saying that the stock is doomed to crash someday soon. At the same time, I'm not convinced that it can avoid a dramatic price correction much longer. So I'll hold a couple of shares after pocketing a generous two-year return on more than half of the original investment. With a modest amount of skin in the game, I'm happy to watch Nvidia from the trading sidelines as the generative AI business evolves.\n\nAnd that's why I'm not an Nvidia bull right now, unlike the vast majority of Wall Street's analysts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Broadcom",
        "content": "Over the past year, businesses raced to implement artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and that boosted sales for semiconductor chip makers Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Both sell components required to implement AI in data centers designed for cloud computing, the ideal place for AI to satisfy its need for massive computing power.\n\nAs a result, Broadcom and Nvidia are positioned to benefit for years as the AI industry expands from 2023's global market size of $136 billion to an estimated $827 billion by 2030. This is one reason owning shares in both is a great way to invest in the secular trend of AI.\n\nHowever, if you had to choose just one of these semiconductor giants to invest in, which would make the better AI investment? Here's a breakdown of each to arrive at an answer.\n\nBroadcom's AI strategy\n\nBroadcom tackles the AI market with an array of products servicing many tech industries, including data centers, wireless networks, and industrial applications. The company's AI strategy involves a combination of hardware and software to help customers meet their needs for AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the hardware side, Broadcom's products include AI accelerators, an essential component to speed up AI computer processing. Its business building custom AI accelerators grew year over year by more than 3 times in its fiscal third quarter, ended Aug. 4.\n\nThanks to demand for its AI-related products, the company's semiconductor division saw fiscal Q3 sales grow to $7.3 billion, up from $6.9 billion in the previous year.\n\nOn the software side, Broadcom acquired VMware toward the end of 2023, which is why its software division's Q3 revenue zoomed up to $5.8 billion from $1.9 billion in the prior year. The addition of VMware enabled total Q3 revenue to grow 47% year over year to $13.1 billion.\n\nBroadcom is using the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform to target businesses wanting a private cloud, or a hybrid of private and public clouds, for their AI systems. The strategy is succeeding. VCF represented 80% of VMware's products booked in Q3.\n\nBroadcom exited its fiscal third quarter with respectable financials, such as free cash flow (FCF) of $4.8 billion. Its balance sheet included total assets of $168 billion, with $10 billion of that in cash and equivalents. Total liabilities were $102.3 billion, with $70 billion of that in debt.\n\nNvidia's AI approach\n\nNvidia's AI success centers around its graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the heart of an AI system's ability to execute complex computations. The company also provides a comprehensive suite of software and other services, such as a robotics platform, to help businesses harness AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe semiconductor giant pioneered the GPU in 1999, steadily improving it over the years. Now, Nvidia's chips are the preferred choice for the AI computing industry.\n\nThe company continues to evolve its processors, with its new Blackwell GPUs ramping up production this year. According to Nvidia, Blackwell is the world's largest, most powerful GPU, housing over 200 billion transistors.\n\nIts GPU leadership in AI enabled Nvidia to hit a record $30 billion in revenue during its fiscal second quarter, ended July 28, a 122% increase from a year ago. The company expects sales to keep growing, forecasting fiscal Q3 revenue to reach $32.5 billion, up from the prior year's $18.1 billion.\n\nNvidia's AI strategy includes extending its GPU strength into various industries, such as automotive, to enable self-driving vehicles. In addition, its CEO, Jensen Huang, believes the cloud computing market, worth nearly $600 billion in 2023, will transition existing infrastructure to support AI systems. This would be a massive market opportunity for chipmakers such as Nvidia.\n\nAdding to the company's investment appeal, Nvidia's financials are excellent. Its fiscal Q2 FCF was $13.5 billion. Its Q2 balance sheet included $85.2 billion in total assets, with $34.8 billion of that in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Total liabilities were $27.1 billion, with $8.5 billion in debt.\n\nDeciding between Broadcom and Nvidia stocks\n\nBecause the AI market is large and growing, both Broadcom and Nvidia should continue to see rising sales. But between the two, Nvidia experienced the largest revenue growth this past year as AI took off, illustrating the customer demand for its products. Data by YCharts.\n\nAnother factor to consider with each stock is their price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess valuation. Broadcom's P/E multiple of 141 is far higher than the 54 for Nvidia shares at the time of this writing, indicating Nvidia is the better value.\n\nCurrently, both Broadcom and Nvidia shares are below their 52-week highs. But Nvidia's market leadership in AI chips, strong financials, and superior valuation compared to Broadcom make it the better long-term investment between these two semiconductor titans.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can Nvidia Stock Hit $200 in 2024?",
        "content": "Over the last two years, the hype around the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has led to incredible operating momentum for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the company that designs and manufactures most of the industry's chips. But while business is roaring, the company's stock price seems to have hit a roadblock. Let's discuss why this might be happening and determine whether Nvidia's shares can hit $200 before the end of the year.\n\nNvidia's rocket-ship rally fades\n\nWith shares up by around 2,450% over the last five years, Nvidia has been a rewarding investment for its long-to-medium-term shareholders. However, the thesis is beginning to unravel, as strong operational results are no longer impressing the market as much as before.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue soared 122% year over year to $30 billion, driven by massive demand for Nvidia's data center graphics processing units (GPUs), which help run and train AI algorithms. The company's bottom line also remains buoyant, with operating income jumping 174% year over year to $18.6 million. Management expects the release of new AI hardware products based on the faster and more efficient Blackwell architecture to stimulate client demand in 2025 and beyond.\n\nNvidia's board also approved a whopping $50 billion worth ofshare repurchases in the quarter, which can boost investors' claim on future earnings by lowering the number of shares outstanding.\n\nHowever, while these are objectively good results, Nvidia's split-adjusted stock price has fallen around 10% since the release on Aug. 28, suggesting many market participants think the operational momentum is unsustainable.\n\nStorm clouds gather over the AI industry\n\nThere are several reasons why investors might take Nvidia's current results with a grain of salt. For starters, the consumer-facing software side of the generative AI industry is yet to prove its monetization potential. For instance, analysts at Goldman Sachs worry that today's AI systems simply aren't designed to solve problems complex enough to justify their costs.\n\nAnd while the technology behind large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT continues to improve, that doesn't necessarily mean they will become easier to monetize because of competition from free, open-source rivals like Meta Platforms' Llama or Elon Musk's Grok. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere is a growing risk that AI could follow the pattern of previous hype cycles like the internet or electric vehicles, where corporations overbuilt capacity in anticipation of consumer demand that didn't materialize quickly. If this happens with generative AI, the market for Nvidia's pricey data center hardware could plateau or decline in the near term -- even if the technology becomes widely adopted over the coming decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's uncertain path to $200 per share\n\nAfter a 10-for-1 stock split in June, Nvidia's modest $115 stock price belies its true size. With a market cap of $2.84 trillion, the GPU chipmaker is already the third-largest company in the world -- behind Microsoft and Apple, which areworth $3.23 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively.\n\nA 73% rally to $200 should take Nvidia's market cap to roughly $4.9 billion, most likely putting it in the No. 1 spot. And with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 41, the stock certainly looks like it has more room to run, considering its triple-digit earnings growth.\n\nThat said, unlike the typical megacap company, which usually built its business over decades by servicing established, profitable sectors in the economy, Nvidia's business remains speculative and uncertain -- earning it a discounted valuation. The company looks unlikely to hit a share price of $200 in 2024 or any time soon until the software side of the AI industry starts to carry its own weight. And that is far from guaranteed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 243%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The popularity of stock splits has seen a resurgence in recent years. While the procedure was common throughout the 1990s, it had faded into near obscurity before enjoying a renaissance over the past decade. Companies will normally embark on a stock split after years of strong operational and financial results have driven a surging stock price. The prospect of a stock split is generally a reason for investors to take a fresh look at the company in question -- and with good reason.\n\nThe strong business performance that ultimately led to the stock split in the first place tends to continue, fueling further gains. Research shows that companies that initiated a stock split normally return 25%, on average, in the year following the announcement, compared with average increases of 12% for the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard.\n\nHere are three stock-split stocks that still have a long runway ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 82%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with loads of upside potential is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has become the de facto flag bearer for recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) thanks to its pioneering work with graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIt turns out that the same chips that revolutionized the gaming industry work equally well at speeding data through the ether, making them the first choice among cloud-computing and data-center operators. It also accelerates the processing of AI models, which helped Nvidia become the gold standard for generative AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated record-quarterly revenue that soared 122% year over year to $30 billion, delivering diluted earnings per share (EPS) that surged 168% to $0.67. The headliner was a blockbuster performance from the company's data-center segment -- which includes AI chips -- as sales soared to $26.3 billion, rising 154%.\n\nThe rise of AI has fueled a blistering increase in Nvidia's stock price, which has gained 716% since the start of 2023 and led to its viral 10-for-1 stock split in June. The stock has experienced a lull in recent months as investors questioned the staying power of one of the market's best performers, but many on Wall Street believe the adoption of AI is just getting started, a trend that favors Nvidia.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC earlier this month, Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles said he \"firmly believes\" that over the next several years, Nvidia's revenue and stock price will double from current levels, driven higher by demand for AI. That suggests potential gains for investors of 82% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe isn't the only one who believes the future is bright. Of the 60 analysts who covered the stock in August, 55 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nI've made no secret about my bullish take on Nvidia, predicting that the stock will top $200 by 2026 -- and I stand by that prediction.\n\nNvidia stock is currently selling for 39 times forward sales. While that might seem lofty at first glance, consider this: Wall Street expects the company's profits to increase by 53%, on average, over the coming five years, showing that Nvidia stock is deserving of a premium.\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Implied upside of 179%\n\nThe second stock split with significant potential upside is Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI). The company is without equal when it comes to satellite radio services in North America. Sirius has 34 million paying subscribers, and its audience increases to 150 million including its ad-supported Pandora music-streaming service, so its listener base is unrivaled.\n\nThe high levels of inflation that marked the past couple of years forced people to make tough choices with their disposable income, and some chose not to renew their Sirius subscription. This, combined with investors' fundamental misunderstanding of its recent merger and the resulting reverse-stock split, has helped push the stock down 56% so far this year. While the results were weak, the stock-price decline is clearly an overreaction.\n\nIn Q2, Sirius' revenue slipped 3% year over year to $2.18 billion, while EPS of $0.08 was flat. While paid subscribers declined by 100,000 (or roughly 1.5%), this was an improvement, as its churn rate continues to slow ahead of an expected turnaround.\n\nDespite the weakness in the stock price, some on Wall Street believe the selling was overdone. Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan is one such analyst. He maintains a buy rating on Sirius XM, with a split-adjusted price target of $65. That represents potential upside of 179% compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst cites a \"market dislocation\" due to its recent merger with tracking stock Liberty Sirius XM. He further believes management's \"strategic initiatives\" will bear fruit.\n\nAdditionally, the declining stock price presents savvy investors with a compelling valuation. Sirius XM is currently selling for roughly 7 times earnings, which factors in little-to-no future growth.\n\nI think the analyst's opinion is spot on, as the improving macroeconomic situation should reignite Sirius XM's growth, which will likely send the stock higher.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside 243%\n\nThe final company in our trio of stock-split stocks with room to run is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly called Supermicro. The company has been designing custom servers for more than 30 years, and the accelerating adoption of AI has taken demand to the next level.\n\nThe secret of the company's success is the building-block architecture of Supermicro's rack-scale servers. This allows customers to design a system that meets their specific needs. Additionally, the company is the dominant provider of servers featuring direct-liquid cooling (DLC), which has become almost table stakes in the era of AI-focused data centers. CEO Charles Liang suggests Supermicro's DLC market share is currently between 70% and 80%.\n\nIn the company's fiscal 2024 Q4 (ended June 30), Supermicro reported record revenue that surged 143% year over year to $5.3 billion, which also increased 38% sequentially. The resulting adjusted EPS jumped 78% to $6.25.\n\nInvestors sold off the stock in the wake of the report, as concerns about the company's declining-profit margin sparked a knee-jerk reaction. Liang said a change in product mix caused by component bottlenecks was to blame, a situation which should be rectified shortly.\n\nSupermicro's track record of strong results has pushed its stock price up 432% since strong demand for AI-centric systems kicked off in early 2023. This caused the company to initiate a 10-for-1 stock split early last month.\n\nLoop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah maintains a buy rating on the stock and a Street-high price target of $1,500. That represents potential upside of 243% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst is bullish on Supermicro's place within the AI server market, citing its leadership when it comes to scale and complexity. He calculates the company's sales will accelerate to a run rate of $40 billion by the end of fiscal 2026, expanding on management's guidance for revenue of $28 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nI think the analyst hit the nail on the head, as Supermicro continues to gain market share at the expense of its rivals.\n\nMany on Wall Street concur. Of the 18 analysts who offered an opinion in August, nine rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFurthermore, at 22 times earnings and less than two times sales, Supermicro is the very definition of an attractively priced stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

On September 17, Stephen Juneau, Bank of America US economist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the impact of an unexpected growth in consumer spending on the economy.\n\nJuneau reiterated that economic data is highly volatile and that the retail data released this morning will not impact the Fed’s rate cut decision tomorrow, and he expects the Fed to stick to a 25-basis point cut. As for consumer behavior, the economy is finally moving toward normalization and the consumer’s basket of goods reflects that. These indications, the increasing labor demand, and a stable investment outlook hint that a hard landing is highly unlikely.\n\nThe Outlook of Investing Amid Rate Cuts\n\nOn September 17, Eric Freedman, US Bank Asset Management Group CIO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate cut and how investors view investing. Freedman said that the rate cut depends on the Fed’s path, therefore an accurate prediction may not be possible at the moment.\n\nFreedman talks about investment from an individual perspective, suggesting investors must move out of the front end of the yield curve. He then pointed to sectors that are currently providing value to investors, including the consumer discretionary sector, some parts of the energy sector, and tech, especially because investments in the sector are predicted to grow rapidly, well into 2025.\n\nHe then discussed what companies need to do to attract investors. Freedman emphasized the need for strong financials and suggested that companies should engage in buybacks or consider increasing dividends. The perfect combination of stocks, according to Freedman, includes companies that are returning cash and seeing strong organic growth.\n\nThe future of the economy and the financial market is quite unpredictable. However, some stocks can influence the market not just now, but also in the future. With that, let’s take a look at the best future stocks for the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best future stocks for the long term we looked up growth stocks in the AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, Electric Vehicle, and Renewable Energy industries. We then ranked the stocks with the highest number of hedge funds as of Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\n\nThe company logged $26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia’s GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best future stocks for the long term. Such can be attributed to its rapid advancements in technology and strategic partnerships. The company’s networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, the company just closed a deal with Salesforce allowing organizations to benefit from advanced AI and data capabilities. Nvidia’s position in the market is solid and explains why it is referred to as the AI star.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 30% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best future stocks for the long-term. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia's CEO Just Explained Why This Is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Stock to Own",
        "content": "No company has been a bigger winner than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) as nearly every tech company has collectively poured billions of dollars into developing their generative AI (artificial intelligence) capabilities. The company has added $2.5 trillion to its market cap over the last two years as sales and profits exploded with the demand for its GPUs.\n\nThe chipmaker has shown incredible pricing power amid the strong demand. That's evidenced by its gross margin expanding into the upper 70% range. And with the booming sales growth, it's seen very high operating leverage, which translates into massive bottom-line growth. To be sure, Nvidia's performance as a business, not just a stock, over the last two years has been nothing short of phenomenal.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only AI chip stock in the market. And CEO Jensen Huang just explained why another company may be worth owning, perhaps even more so than his own company. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n\"The world's best by an incredible margin\"\n\nAt an investor conference earlier this month, Huang had high praise for one of Nvidia's biggest business partners: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), known as TSMC.\n\nTSMC is the largest semiconductor foundry, or fab, in the world. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it takes it to TSMC to actually print the design on a silicon wafer. That takes incredible precision and innovative technical capabilities. TSMC is the top choice for many chip designers, including Nvidia. TSMC commands over 60% of global spending at chip foundries.\n\n\"We're fabbing out of TSMC because it's the world's best,\" Huang said. \"And it's the world's best not by a small margin, it's the world's best by an incredible margin.\"\n\nThat's why Nvidia and almost anyone else that needs to produce cutting-edge chips picks TSMC over its competitors. Huang did say Nvidia could switch to another foundry if it had to. But he also said competitors' capabilities can't match TSMC's and it would result in less performance or higher cost.\n\nHe also praised TSMC's ability to scale its operations. When Nvidia saw demand for its chips skyrocket, TSMC was able to help it meet that growing demand so it could take advantage of the opportunity. Any business that needs to be able to scale up needs to work with TSMC.\n\nImportantly, TSMC's position as the market leader, winning the majority of revenue in the industry, ensures it'll stay in its leading position. It has more money to reinvest in R&D and create the next generation of processes. The virtuous cycle leads to more and more big contracts with big tech companies designing super high-end chips over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC still has a lot of growth left\n\nTSMC might be the biggest company in the industry, but there's still a ton of growth for it to capture.\n\nTech companies are all planning to ramp up their spending on AI systems in data centers. Total spending on AI chip content and related systems is forecast to reach $193.3 billion in 2027, according to estimates from IDC. That's up from $117.5 billion this year, translating into an 18% compound annual growth rate over the next three years.\n\nImportantly, TSMC is highly agnostic to that growth. Whether that growth comes from Nvidia, one of its competitors, or custom chips designed by its biggest customers, TSMC is likely winning the bulk of those contracts. In fact, the virtuous cycle and TSMC's leadership in cutting-edge chips means it could grow that part of its business even faster than the industry. On top of that, TSMC has room to improve its margins.\n\nThat's all reflected in analysts' forecasts for the company over the next five years. The average analyst expects TSMC to grow earnings over 20% per year for the next half-decade. But you don't have to pay up for that growth. Shares currently trade at just over 20 times the consensus 2025 earnings forecast.\n\nFew other companies offer that same level of potential growth at that price. So, not only is it the world's best fab by an incredible margin, investors can buy a stake in it right now at an incredible price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin Still Has More Upside Potential Than Any Tech Stock, and That Includes Nvidia",
        "content": "It's hard to beat the growth potential of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which Goldman Sachs recently called \"the most important stock on planet Earth.\" A $1,000 investment made just five years ago would be worth upwards of $26,000 today.\n\nNvidia now boasts a colossal market cap of nearly $3 trillion, and is poised for years of impressive gains, thanks to the growth opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBut don't forget about Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), which has just as much -- and possibly more -- future upside potential as Nvidia. And, while it might seem counterintuitive, an investment in Bitcoin may actually be less risky than many people think.\n\nUpside potential\n\nAdmittedly, Nvidia has outperformed Bitcoin this year, and it's not even close. In 2024, Nvidia is up about 130%, while Bitcoin is up only 40%. Moreover, Nvidia has outperformed Bitcoin during the past 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months. Over the past two years, Nvidia is up 764%, compared to just 209% for Bitcoin. So it's time to forget about Bitcoin and go all-in on Nvidia, right? Bitcoin / U.S. dollar chart by TradingView\n\nWrong. And that's because stocks are not valued based on how they've performed in the past, but rather how they are going to perform in the future. And this is where the upside potential of Bitcoin is so impressive. Quite simply, the further you extend your price forecast into the future, the better Bitcoin looks.\n\nFor example, investment firm Bernstein thinks Bitcoin could more than triple in price to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025. A growing number of Silicon Valley tech leaders think Bitcoin could hit a price of $1 million within the next few years, and Cathie Wood of Ark Invest thinks that Bitcoin could hit a price of $3.8 million by 2030.\n\nBut all of those price predictions pale in comparison to the one made by Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy. He thinks Bitcoin could hit $13 million by the year 2045. He's convinced that Bitcoin is the future of money, and that it has the potential to replace the U.S. dollar. You might not agree, but that's what creates markets.\n\nBased on today's Bitcoin price of about $60,000, a price of $13 million represents a gain of more than 21,000%. Can you find any Wall Street analysts willing to make the same prediction for Nvidia?\n\nRisk and volatility\n\nOf course, Bitcoin's enormous upside potential comes with significant risk. The U.S. government could ban Bitcoin, as some other governments have done. U.S. tax authorities could make it extremely burdensome to hold Bitcoin for the long haul, if they require investors to pay taxes on unrealized capital gains. And the Securities and Exchange Commission could act to classify Bitcoin as a security, creating an immediate existential risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it's not like Nvidia doesn't come with its own share of risks. The AI boom could turn out to be a huge speculative bubble, with some already comparing it to the dot-com bubble of the 2000s. And it's not like Nvidia doesn't have its share of competitive rivals, any of which could snatch market share away. Nvidia may never be able to satisfy Wall Street's insatiable appetite for growth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThus, a better way of comparing Bitcoin to Nvidia head-to-head likely involves some comparison of risk-adjusted returns. In other words, just how much risk are you taking on to get all that upside potential? In the best of all worlds, you would pick the investment that provides the highest upside possible while taking on as little risk as possible.\n\nAnd this is where things get very interesting, because on a risk-adjusted basis, Bitcoin may not be as risky as you think. According to Fidelity Investments, at the start of 2024 Bitcoin had the highest Sharpe ratio (which measures risk-adjusted returns) of any asset class over the past five years. This means that, even though you are taking on a tremendous amount of risk with Bitcoin, you are getting paid for it.\n\nBitcoin or Nvidia?\n\nIf forced to pick between Bitcoin and Nvidia, I would pick Bitcoin. It's hard to ignore the fact that it has been among the top-performing assets in the world for so long. And, thanks to the launch of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, Bitcoin finally appears to be joining the mainstream. You no longer need to be a crypto enthusiast to buy Bitcoin; you can buy it as easily as you would your favorite tech stock.\n\nAnd, while the million-dollar price predictions for Bitcoin might strike many as being a bit outlandish, they certainly demonstrate just how much upside potential this cryptocurrency has. Over just about any time horizon, it has more upside potential than any tech stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

This ensures a smooth and uninterrupted intelligent experience for both drivers and passengers, according to Alibaba Cloud.\n\n\"Together with our partners, we want to empower more businesses and individuals to unlock the potential of generative AI,\" Alibaba Cloud chief technology officer Zhou Jingren said at the event.\n\nWith Qwen's advanced capabilities in handling complex inquiries and processing visual intelligence, the new LMM solution will enable in-car voice assistants to engage in dynamic, multi-turn conversations, according to Alibaba Cloud. These assistants will also be able to offer recommendations, ranging from providing information about nearby landmarks to proactively suggesting car headlights be turned on during certain conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs part of that LMM solution, Alibaba Cloud's Mobile Agent will enable vehicle owners to effortlessly execute voice commands, such as ordering milkshakes through a food delivery app, resulting in richer in-car experiences, according to Alibaba Cloud.\n\nWhile stringent US export controls bar Nvidia from selling its most-advanced graphics processing units to mainland Chinese firms, the US company still has a thriving business on the mainland. In its financial year ended January 28, Nvidia said China was its third-largest market.\n\nAlibaba Cloud's resources and capabilities are on display at the three-day Apsara Conference in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province, that runs until Saturday.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling Its Shares and Buying Up These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Wall Street has fallen in love with the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. This is not surprising, considering that PwC analysts expect AI to add nearly $15.7 trillion to the global economy annually by the end of 2030.\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have gained nearly 430% in the past three years. While the AI trend is still going strong, many analysts now view Nvidia's shares as being priced for perfection. Challenges such as increasing competition, reduced pricing power, geopolitical and regulatory risks, and over-reliance on a few customers may negatively impact the company's share price in the coming months.\n\nBillionaire investors such as George Soros of Soros Fund Management, Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office, Lee Ainslie of Maverick Capital, and David Tepper of Appaloosa Management sold shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, according to their 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, many billionaire investors have been putting money into more reasonably priced AI stocks such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nThose two billionaire picks could be smart buys for retail investors, too.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, is a leading provider of server and storage solutions for data centers. Its shares are up by nearly 1,110% over the past three years, even after the stock fell by almost 64% from its 52-week high in March -- a slide mainly triggered by weak investor sentiment toward growth stocks. The company has delayed filing its 10K for its fiscal 2024, which did not go over well with investors, and an unfavorable report from short-seller Hindenburg Research also took a toll on the stock.\n\nDespite this, increasing demand for AI-optimized infrastructure from data centers, enterprise customers, consumer internet companies, and governments remains a major growth catalyst. Bank of America expects the AI server market to grow at a 50% compound average rate over the next three years, and expects Supermicro's share of the AI server market to grow from 10% in 2023 to 17% in 2026.\n\nSupermicro's servers stand out from other mass-produced servers because they are easily customizable to their owners' changing requirements, energy efficient, and effective in thermal management. Goldman Sachs has projected that data center power demand will rise by nearly 160% from 2022 to 2030. With data centers estimated to account for a whopping 3% to 4% of global power consumption by 2030, demand for Supermicro's AI-optimized servers integrated with liquid cooling technology should continue to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nSupermicro also benefits from its close ties with major chip manufacturers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel. These relationships give it early access to advanced chip technologies, which it then embeds in its server solutions. Supermicro thus offers its clients early access to the newest advanced technologies.\n\nAnalysts now expect Supermicro's revenues to grow by 88.3% year over year to $28.14 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise by 52.3% year over year to $33.65 in its fiscal 2025 (which will end in June 2025). Although analysts' estimates for fiscal 2026 have been muted, that's not surprising considering the high base they will be growing from. In fiscal 2026, Supermicro's revenues and adjusted EPS are expected to grow by 10.8% and 30.2%, respectively.\n\nSupermicro is trading at about 23 times earnings, far lower than its historical three-year average of 30.4 times. Considering the company's focus on energy-efficient computing, its close relationships with chip manufacturers, and its reasonable valuation, Super Micro is a smart pick now.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTechnology behemoth Microsoft was also a favorite buy among billionaire investors in the second quarter. While the stock did not soar even after the company reported a double beat in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended June 30), it is still up by around 14.7% so far in 2024.\n\nInvestors were concerned about the slower-than-expected growth of the Azure cloud computing business last quarter, which was mainly attributed to the constrained capacity of AI services. However, this will most likely prove to be a short-term headwind. With demand for Azure AI services going strong, Microsoft expects increased capital expenditures in AI capacity will reaccelerate Azure's growth by the second half of fiscal 2025.\n\nAzure AI enables enterprises to build custom AI applications by giving them access to prebuilt models, advanced security features, collaboration tools, and other supporting infrastructure. These services are rapidly gaining popularity, as is evident from the 60,000-strong customer base of Azure AI at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, up 60% on a year-over-year basis. Azure also remains a preferred choice for enterprises handling multicloud and hybrid workloads. This is apparent considering that Azure accounted for a 20% share of global cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nMicrosoft has also embedded OpenAI's generative AI capabilities to build its AI-powered Copilot agent, which it has integrated across many of its products and services. Since it became generally available, more than 77,000 organizations have adopted Copilot. Copilot for its Microsoft 365 productivity suite saw a 60% quarter-over-quarter increase in customer count in fiscal Q4. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of Copilot has played a pivotal role in doubling the number of large enterprise customers with more than 10,000 seats for Microsoft 365 on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nBesides cloud computing, business productivity, and AI, Microsoft also has a solid presence in cybersecurity, gaming, and professional networking. The company posted impressive financial results in fiscal 2024, with revenues and earnings jumping 16% and 20%, respectively. That's why it makes sense for retail investors to piggyback on billionaire investors' enthusiasm and purchase at least a small stake in this diversified technology giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This $80 Billion Market Could Be the Next Big Growth Driver for Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) bread-and-butter business for a long, long time. The company initially made its name producing GPUs meant for deployment in personal computers (PCs) for gaming and content creation, before eventually striking gold with its data center GPUs that are now in red-hot demand thanks to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAs it turns out, data center compute chips now produce the majority of Nvidia's revenue. The company sold $22.6 billion worth of data center GPUs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on July 28). The segment's revenue shot up 162% year over year, accounting for 75% of the company's top line. However, there is another niche within the data center business where Nvidia is now gaining impressive traction.\n\nThis particular business segment is now bigger than Nvidia's gaming business, and it could turn out to be a key growth driver for the company in the long run. Here's a closer look at this emerging business that could supercharge Nvidia's growth.\n\nNvidia is making terrific progress in this $80 billion market\n\nNvidia sells two types of data center chips. The first are the GPUs, which are already generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company each quarter. The second type of Nvidia's data center chips is its networking chips, which are also selling like hotcakes as the company's latest quarterly results show.\n\nNvidia sold $3.7 billion worth of networking chips in the previous quarter, up 114% from the same quarter last year. The company's networking revenue in the first half of the fiscal year stood at $6.8 billion, translating into an annual revenue run rate of nearly $14 billion. The global data center networking market is estimated to generate $37.6 billion in revenue this year. If Nvidia indeed ends fiscal 2025 with $14 billion in data center networking revenue, it would end up controlling 37% of this market.\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that Nvidia is reportedly growing at a faster pace than the data center networking space, which has received a major shot in the arm thanks to the advent of AI. According to market research firm Dell'Oro Group, the size of the data center switching market is likely to expand by 50% thanks to the growing need for switches deployed in back-end AI server networks.\n\nThe researcher sees spending on switches used in back-end AI servers hitting $80 billion over the next five years, which would be nearly double the size of the current data center switch market. We have already seen that Nvidia is enjoying a solid share of this market, and Dell'Oro points out the same. The research firm says that the InfiniBand networking platform is currently dominating the market for AI back-end networks, and it is worth noting that Nvidia offers networking products based on this networking communications standard.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia sells InfiniBand adapters, switches, data processing units (DPUs), routers, gateways, cables, and transceivers to customers. Dell'Oro, however, points out that the Ethernet-based networking standard could eventually overtake the InfiniBand standard in the next few years. The good news for Nvidia investors is that Nvidia has already set its sights on the Ethernet AI networking platform.\n\nIt claims that its Spectrum-X networking platform is the world's first Ethernet networking platform for AI and is capable of accelerating AI networking performance by 1.6x when compared to traditional Ethernet. Nvidia management's comments on the August earnings conference call suggest that Spectrum-X has gained terrific traction among customers. According to CFO Colette Kress: \"Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprises, including xAI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world.\"\n\nA new multibillion-dollar business in the making\n\nKress says that Spectrum-X is \"well on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\" So, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia eventually cornering a sizable portion of the data center networking market. The rate of growth of Nvidia's networking business means it is growing at a faster pace than the data center networking market right now, which is why it won't be surprising to see it capture a bigger share of this space in the future.\n\nBut even if the company holds on to its current market share of nearly 40% after five years, its annual networking revenue could hit $32 billion (based on the $80 billion market size projected earlier). That would be a nice jump from the current annual revenue run rate of $14 billion in the networking business.\n\nThrow in the rosy prospects of the overall AI chip market, which is expected to clock $311 billion in annual revenue in 2029, and it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's data center business becoming even bigger in the long run than it is right now. Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to increase at an annual rate of over 52% for the next five years.\n\nThat's why investors looking to add an AI stock to their portfolios should consider buying Nvidia right away as it is currently trading at 42 times forward earnings, a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-earnings ratio of 45.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Friday, September 20, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT), as well as a micro-cap stock CSP Inc. (CSPI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+138.1% vs. +96.7%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 46.4% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds and the US-China tech war remain major concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the year-to-date period (+44.5% vs. +24.5%). The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust portfolio, paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general. \r\n\r\nNetflix added 8.05 million paid subscribers globally in second-quarter 2024, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content. \r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ is a headwind. NFLX’s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)\r\n\r\nApplied Materials’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry over the year-to-date period (+19.2% vs. +11.7%). The company is benefiting from strength in the Applied Global Services segment, owing to the growing adoption of the 200-mm system. Solid momentum in the subscription and display businesses is a plus. \r\n\r\nGrowing Semiconductor Systems revenues owing to rebound in the semiconductor industry is a major positive. The company’s strength in IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors (ICAPS) is likely to continue aiding its position in the semiconductor industry in the days ahead. Its broad-based diversified portfolio remains its key growth driver. \r\n\r\nHowever, softness in the Corporate & Other segment remains a concern. Weakening momentum across Taiwan and Europe is a major negative. Growing geo-political tensions between the United States and China are headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Applied Materials here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of CSP have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the year-to-date period (+31.1% vs. +27.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $121.85 million have seen growth driven by its services segment, with a 10% increase in service revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024, improving the gross margin by 150 basis points to 35%. \r\n\r\nThe AZT PROTECT product line offers strong growth potential, with expanding reseller partnerships and integration with companies like Forescout, Ebix and Rockwell. A robust cash position of $28.9 million enhances strategic flexibility. Recurring revenue models, including managed services and UCaaS, support cash flow stability, with UCaaS revenues doubling in fiscal 2024. \r\n\r\nCSPI’s Technology Solutions division remains resilient, with long-term revenue visibility from IT infrastructure projects. The company's strategic expansion into mid-tier markets, and growing presence in cloud, AI and cybersecurity sectors positions it for growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CSP here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Arista Networks, Inc.

        "title": "Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has crushed bubble fears and has seen a meteoric rise in the past few years amid the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, however, believes NVIDIA’s growth story is just beginning, while the Federal Reserve’s recent jumbo interest rate cuts should help the company access cheaper capital. So, is this the most opportune moment to place bets on the stock? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nWhy a Rate Cut Will Boost NVIDIA Stock\n\nIn Wednesday’s concluded policy meeting, the Fed trimmed interest rates by half a point to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market. For the first time in four years, the Fed eased its monetary policy and kept the interest rates at 4.75% to 5%.\n\nThe Summary of Economic Projections further showed that most Fed officials expect another 50-basis point rate cut by the end of the year, followed by 100 and 50-basis point rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n\nA lower interest rate environment bodes well for NVIDIA since the semiconductor behemoth’s cash flows essential for growth initiatives aren’t affected. At the same time the company’s cost of borrowings gets reduced, eventually boosting the profit margins vis-à-vis the share price (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates).\n\nPost-Rate Cut: NVIDIA Stock Beats the S&P 500’s Return\n\nNVIDIA stock has always performed well after interest rate cut announcements. As a result, the company’s share price increased nearly 4% on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Dow Jones Market Data, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 6.9%, 16.6%, 16.7%, and 20.7% in the month, three months, six months and 12 months following a rate cut.\n\nOn the other hand, going back to the 1990s, the S&P 500 Index, on average, gained only 2.9% in the 12 months after a rate cut, indicating NVIDIA stock has more upside than most of the listed stocks in the broader index.\n\nAnother Reason Why NVIDIA Stock Popped Yesterday\n\nIt’s not just the long-awaited big Fed rate cut that pushed the NVIDIA stock higher yesterday. CEO Jensen Huang’s encouraging comments on the AI movement at the Dreamforce technological gathering hosted by Salesforce, Inc. CRM also had investors pouring into NVDA stock.\n\nHuang said the AI industry is transforming from tools to an industry of skills, and there is a huge opportunity in the field of AI that NVIDIA can exploit. This has given investors all the more reason to believe that NVIDIA’s stunning growth isn’t over yet. Even though NVIDIA stock has fallen off its record highs, its shares have outpaced the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+138.1% vs +89%).\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA’s advanced chips are needed to train large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini and function AI interfaces. NVIDIA stock, thus, is expected to gain as the AI industry is projected to grow from around $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\n\nMoreover, AI is here to stay as its foundation is based on practical applications, unlike the dot com era when companies were involved in speculative businesses (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\n\n3 Key Reasons to be Bullish on NVIDIA Stock\n\nEncouraging developments on Blackwell chip production, dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market and capability to generate profits consistently also act as tailwinds for the NVIDIA stock.\n\nHuang confirmed that NVIDIA has ramped up the production of cutting-edge Blackwell chips as demand has soared among the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. After all, the Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chip.\n\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA accounts for the bulk of the share in the GPU market as more developers depend on the CUDA software platform, unlike Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (AMD) not-so-efficient ROCm software platform. NVIDIA, thus, is well-poised to make the most of the rise in the GPU market, which is likely to expand to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\n\nFundamentally, the NVIDIA stock is sound. This is because its return on equity (ROE) is around 120% compared with the industry’s 73.2%. An ROE above 100% indicates that the company’s net income is more than the equity or that it has given a strong performance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Stock is Expensive – Here’s How to Trade it\n\nGiven the positives, things are looking brighter for the NVIDIA stock. Prominent brokers have increased NVDA’s average short-term price target by 31.3% from the stock’s last closing price of $113.37. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 76.4%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the NVDA stock is still pricey. Per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock, presently, trades at 42.0X forward earnings. However, NVDA’s rivals or the peer group’s forward earnings multiple is 16.4X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, investors should wait for the right entry point to buy the stock so it doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should stick to it since the stock has a strong upside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Is SLB's Premium Stock Valuation Still Justified? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "SLB SLB is currently considered expensive on a relative basis, with the stock trading at an 8.26x trailing 12-month Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA), which is at a premium compared with the broader industry average of 6.92x. A premium valuation generally indicates that the market has strong confidence in the company’s prospects. However, this necessitates scrutiny to determine if this higher price is warranted. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTherefore, a more thorough analysis is needed to determine whether SLB's premium valuation is justified based on its fundamentals, growth prospects and prevailing market conditions.\n\nSLB's AI Collaboration With NVIDIA & Launch of Lumi Platform\n\nWith a strong focus on developing generative artificial intelligence (AI) solutions specifically for energy companies, SLB has been deepening its partnership with NVIDIA NVDA. This collaboration will enhance the oilfield services giant’s capabilities in subsurface exploration, production and data management, leading to improved operational efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint. This is likely to give SLB a technological edge and drive growth.\n\nAnother development on the company’s front that will create significant value is the launch of the AI-powered Lumi Platform.  The Lumi™ data and AI platform is built to integrate advanced AI technologies, including generative AI, throughout the energy value chain. By enhancing data-driven decision-making and automation, the platform aims to boost operational efficiency and lower costs for SLB's customers, adding value to the company.\n\nStrategic Contracts Boost SLB’s Financial Gains\n\nSLB has secured significant contracts, including a major one from Petrobras PBR for subsea production systems and another for a large-scale carbon capture project on the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nThe key project from Petrobras, announced on Aug. 2, involves the second development phase of the Atapu and Sepia fields, which are situated in the highly productive pre-salt Santos Basin offshore Brazil. SLB will manufacture most of the technology and equipment for use in these developments, including vertical trees and subsea control systems, at its facilities in Brazil. The contract will generate substantial cash flows, and the leading oilfield service company has announced that it will maintain its investments in Brazil as the country continues to be a crucial area for growth.\n\nThe large-scale carbon capture project on the U.S. Gulf Coast underscores SLB’s strong commitment to addressing climate change. On Aug. 1, the joint venture between SLB and Aker Carbon Capture was awarded a contract for the front-end engineering and design of a large-scale carbon capture plant. This project will be capable of capturing 800,000 tons of carbon emissions annually from a pulp and paper mill on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This initiative underscores SLB’s strong dedication to carbon capture, which could potentially yield significant long-term financial rewards for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould Investors Bet on SLB Despite its Premium Valuation?\n\nSLB’s balance sheet reveals minimal reliance on debt capital. While the company’s debt-to-capitalization is 37.2%, slightly above the industry average of 36%, this still indicates low debt exposure for both SLB and the industry. As a result, SLB's solid balance sheet positions it well to navigate challenging business environments. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe positive developments have led to SLB’s premium valuations, as investors have high expectations for the company’s prospects and profitability. Consequently, they are willing to pay a premium for the stock, believing it will outperform both its peers and the broader market in the coming months.\n\nHowever, there is some uncertainty surrounding the stock. While SLB is expanding into carbon capture, the market is still in its early stages. The ability of the carbon capture business to significantly contribute to SLB’s revenues is still evolving. Additionally, the company’s growth prospects are closely linked to oil prices. Although current prices are favorable, they are highly volatile, and any decline could affect SLB’s operational performance and profitability.\n\nAlso, there has been a slowdown in drilling activities in both the North American and International markets, leading to a decline in demand for the company's services, such as reservoir productivity and performance optimization. All these uncertainties are getting reflected in SLB’s poor year-to-date price performance. Over the period, the stock declined 16.8%, underperforming the fall of 4.3% of the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThus, though SLB’s long-term outlook remains strong, investors are advised to be cautious. Hence, instead of rushing to add SLB, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to their portfolios, it may be prudent to wait for a more opportune entry point.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Interest rates decisions have occupied much of the market's focus recently, and while the earnings calendar is looking a little lighter, there are still a number of companies reporting in the coming week.\n\nIn the US, investors will be looking to see if BlackBerry, formerly the maker of the iconic smartphone, will report continued performance improvement with its focus now on cybersecurity.\n\nMarkets will also be keeping an eye on full-year results from memory chipmaker Micron, as one of the stocks considering to be powering the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nIn Europe, investors will be looking to see if holiday company TUI is set to deliver on profit targets.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of high-street fashion, H&M Group's quarterly update should give an idea as to whether the retailer is on course to meet its operating margin target.\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nBack in the US, investors will be looking to see if Costco can continue its run of strong performance as consumers seek out value for money on everyday essentials.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nBlackBerry (BB) — Reports second quarter results on Thursday 26 September\n\nShares in BlackBerry popped following the release of its first-quarter results in June, so investors will be looking to this latest set of quarterly figures to see if the tech company has continued to see improved performance.\n\nBlackBerry's first-quarter revenue of $144m (£108m) beat estimates, with 18% growth year-on-year in its internet of things (IoT) division. It did report a loss of $0.03 per share but said this beat previously-provided guidance.\n\n\"The company is making significant progress towards operational independence for our IoT and cybersecurity businesses, as well as towards profitability,\" said John J Giamatteo, BlackBerry CEO.\n\nRead more: Bank of England holds interest rates at 5%\n\nBlackBerry said it expected revenues to come in at between $136m and $144m for the second quarter and between $586m and $616m for the full-year 2025.\n\nIn an investor update back in February, BlackBerry said it planned to make further layoffs in its cybersecurity division as it looked to reduced costs, on top of the 200 job cuts the company had announced in the previous quarter.\n\nDespite stronger company performance more recently, BlackBerry's share price has continued to slump, down 32%.\n\nThe stock has failed to return to its highs of 2008, as BlackBerry's iconic smartphone famously fell out of favour with users as touch screen smart phones came onto the market. BlackBerry stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and has since focused on cybersecurity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company became a favourite of the meme stock craze, in which some investors piled into unloved stocks after they gained popularity on social media.\n\nMicron (MU) — Reports full-year results on Wednesday 25 September\n\nMemory chipmaker Micron Technology has slid since June, when it shared an outlook that disappointed analyst expectations, with shares up just 5% year-to-date.\n\nIn its third-quarter results, Micron reported figures that topped Wall Street estimates, as it reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 versus the estimate of $0.50. Adjusted revenue of $6.81bn topped the estimated $6.67bn.\n\n“Robust AI demand and strong execution enabled Micron to drive 17% sequential revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range in fiscal Q3,” said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron Technology.\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nMicron is considered one of the stocks powering the AI boom, as it provides memory solutions for these chips. In fact, its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are used in Nvidia's (NVDA) graphic processing unit (GPU).\n\nShares fell earlier in the month after BNP Paribas warned the stock would continue to underperform against AI peers, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nAnalyst Karl Ackerman downgraded the stock to underperform from outperform, cutting his price target on Micron to $67 from $140.\n\nHe said that a capacity oversupply of HBM chips would result in a \"faster than anticipated market correction\" in average selling prices of dynamic random-access memory chips.\n\nTUI (TUI1.DE) — Releases trading update on Tuesday 24 September\n\nShares in Europe's biggest holiday company TUI have ticked higher over the last month after it posted a third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, thanks to strong summer travel demand.\n\nTUI’s underlying earnings before interest and tax came in at to €232m (£195m) for the three months to 30 June, up 37% from €169m for the same period last year.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): The ‘Only Company on Earth’ That Can Catch Up to Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCommenting on the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, Jim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that the “double” rate cut was needed for the economy and it would help the housing market, industrials and companies catering to the “less well-off” households.\n\n“There really are two economies in this country. There is the one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it’s harder to find a job and then there is one that says we don’t really care about where the stinking rates are. That’s who we can get a double rate cut today and still going lower.”\n\nCramer said he is currently in Silicon Valley and after talking to many companies, he feels tech companies do not care about interest rates since they are selling to businesses. Cramer said these technology companies are focused on innovation.\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his latest programs on CNBC. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Jim Cramer’s Top Pick Stock to Buy and Sell?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nTalking about AI semiconductor stocks, Cramer said that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is among his charitable trust holdings.\n\nCramer said he started buying AMD shares when they began their slide in July.\n\n“While Nvidia is currently unrivaled in the red hot AI infrastructure space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is in the second place, that’s a close second there is nobody in third. And that’s the only company on Earth that stands a chance to catching up to Nvidia,” Cramer said.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs,9 GPUs, FPGAs,10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Intel Corporation (INTC)’s Shares Rose After Announcement of Plans To Turn Its Manufacturing Foundry Business Into An Independent Unit’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Don’t Miss Out: Jim Cramer’s 10 Key Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against Jim Cramer's other key stocks to watch.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce, to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what’s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There’s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That’s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\"\n\nUnlocking Profit Potential with Lower Rates and AI\n\nJim Cramer stated that today's market movements show it's possible to navigate unpredictable conditions. He emphasized that we don't need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to decrease, which is essential for maintaining a bull market. He advised against overthinking the situation and suggested focusing on profitable opportunities, particularly the growing importance of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don’t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that’s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I’d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that while AI is generating excitement in the stock market, its impact on the broader economy has been limited. There are some practical applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. This is why many analysts are starting to label the hype around AI as a bubble.\n\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We’ve heard so much about this technology and how it’s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn’t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings—nothing flashy. That’s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI, especially when combined with advanced computing from chipmakers, significantly speeds up processes and enables machines to act intelligently, similar to capable humans. He noted that businesses aim to create quality products for consumers, but a shortage of workers has become a major issue, particularly highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This has led to sales associates being too busy to engage effectively with customers, resulting in rushed and confusing interactions.\n\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Business wants to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes—that’s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\n\nThat became apparent during COVID. We can’t interact effectively because our sales associates are too busy to be anything but brisk or confused. They’re harried from the moment they come in to the moment they leave. It’s a late-stage capitalist directive. What can I say? What doctor has time to talk to you? What nurse practitioner can give you the time of day?\"\n\nTransforming Customer Service with Superior AI Agents\n\nCramer pointed out that companies are pushing their employees hard to boost profits, which can create a stressful environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, he recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage with customers politely, and efficiently answering common questions by using personalized data.\n\nCramer argued that AI is an ideal solution for customer service, as it can provide clear and friendly assistance without the frustrations that often come from human employees who are overwhelmed and eager to leave. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries on their own.\n\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond your data. It knows your preferences.\n\nThis is the perfect way to handle customer interactions instead of relying on humans who can be unclear, impatient, or exhausted. Humans are, well, human, harried and ready to go home. But machines infused with AI are delightful, smart, and engaging. They don’t mind going to work, and that’s where these AI agents come in. The machines can listen, reason, and either direct you to the right place or handle everything themselves.\"\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI offers a better experience than what we currently have. For instance, in retail, AI knows customer preferences, helps with returns, and suggests alternatives based on previous purchases, reducing the need to deal with human salespeople who might be stressed or impatient. If customers are still unhappy, they can opt to talk to a human, but they might prefer the friendly interaction with the AI agent.\n\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It’s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you’re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to—but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\n\nRevolutionizing Everyday Life: How AI Outperforms Humans in Healthcare, Driving, and Beyond\n\nCramer added that AI's potential extends beyond retail. He believes that in ten years, we might wonder why we relied on doctors when AI agents could provide kinder, more empathetic care. These AI systems could analyze millions of test results, quickly identifying serious health issues like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer, making it easier to spot dangerous patterns before they become serious problems. AI's ability to compile and analyze data effectively is key to this advancement.\n\n\"It’s not just retail. In ten years, I think we’ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor’s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic—like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It’s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer pointed out that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He noted that AI can also handle tasks like proofreading and correcting errors without making mistakes. This efficiency allows law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They’re much safer than human drivers. They don’t drink and drive—they don’t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\n\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents often perform better than humans in most situations. For repetitive tasks, he believes it's preferable to interact with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed or frustrated human who may not want to engage.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you’d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn’t want to deal with you.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, highlighting ten key stocks he reviewed. We ranked them by hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA technician soldering components for a semiconductor board.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nJim Cramer reported that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s struggling shares rose 7% after the company announced plans to separate its manufacturing foundry business into an independent unit with its own board, allowing it to seek outside funding. Additionally, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) revealed a partnership with Amazon Web Services to create custom AI semiconductors.\n\n\"Embattled Intel shares jumped 7% after the chipmaker late Monday announced plans to turn its manufacturing foundry business into an independent unit. It will have its own board and the potential to raise outside capital. Intel said, separately, that it entered a deal with cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services to produce custom AI semiconductors.\"\n\nA bullish view on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is supported by improvements in earnings, advancements in semiconductor technology, and strategic investments in manufacturing. In its latest quarterly report,  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reported $12.9 billion in revenue for Q2 2023, largely due to increased demand for its chips, especially in the data center and AI markets.\n\nThe introduction of its Intel 4 Manufacturing Process improves product performance and efficiency, helping Intel compete better with rivals like\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMD) and\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA). As demand for AI and data center solutions grows,  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is also developing specialized chips, such as the Gaudi and Habana processors, which are expected to boost future revenue.\n\nAdditionally,  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s plans to build new manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe will strengthen its supply chain and enhance production capacity over the long term. Recent announcements about expanding AI initiatives and updates on manufacturing progress highlight  Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s commitment to growth, reinforcing a positive outlook for its recovery and future success in the semiconductor market.\n\nAriel Global Fund stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alternatively, several positions weighed on performance. One of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), underperformed in the period on news of a longer than expected turnaround in profitability within the Foundry business. This was exacerbated by disappointing near-term guidance due to a weakening demand environment signaling an extended replacement cycle.\n\nWe view the quarter as a temporary trough that should dissipate as we see signs of a cyclical recovery for personal computers (PCs) and central processing units (CPUs), driven by the Windows 11 upgrade. In our view, the market is overlooking the progress Intel is making to advance its manufacturing process. Not to mention, the company’s efforts to serve as a viable second source foundry partner of leading-edge silicon. We believe the separation of the design and manufacturing businesses will be a key catalyst in unlocking improved financial performance while also enhancing the competitiveness of the foundry business.”\n\nOverall INTC ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer's key stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog NVIDIA, Microsoft and   Micron Technology",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – September 20 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates\n\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates aggressively and penciled in further rate cuts by the end of the year. It slashed the benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75-5% for the first time since March 2020.\n\nInterest rates have been hovering at a 23-year high to combat relentless price pressures. However, signs of inflationary pressure have ebbed recently, giving the Fed all the more reason to cut interest rates aggressively and let investors know that the central bank is not behind the curve.\n\nA lower interest rate scenario may lead to stock gains for major artificial intelligence (AI) tech players like NVIDIA Corp., Microsoft Corp.  and Micron Technology, Inc. This is because interest rate cuts reduce their borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Interest rate cuts also don’t disrupt the cash flows needed for growth initiatives to enhance shareholder’s wealth.\n\nBy the way, the euphoria about the AI revolution hasn’t faded. It’s here to stay and should drive the prices of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron northward. After all, NVIDIA provides technology for AI applications, Microsoft builds AI resources for its customers and Micron is a memory specialist. AI’s data centers require a lot of memory.\n\nAccording to Statista, the AI industry is expected to grow beyond $184 billion in 2024 and continue to expand until 2030, with an estimated market size of $826 billion (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\n\nEven so, let’s look at other reasons why NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron’s shares have more room to run.\n\nKey NVIDIA Tailwind: Supremacy in the GPU Space\n\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, as huge chunks of data are transferred from the central processing units to graphic processing units (GPU), NVIDIA will gain due to its bulk share in the GPU market. Precedence Research noted that the GPU market is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion in 2034 from $75.77 billion in the current year at a CAGR of 13.8%.\n\nSince developers rely more on the CUDA software platform than AMD's ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s GPUs have a wide competitive moat. NVIDIA’s data center GPU business revenues were $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 for NVDA’s earnings per share (EPS) is up 76.1% from the prior year (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\nStory continues\n\nKey MSFT Tailwind: Azure Growth\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure and cloud services business has picked up steam, with revenues from this segment increasing 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure unit is expanding faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has dominated the cloud computing market for quite some time.\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure could soon overtake AWS since it has grown from half the size of AWS in 2019 to about three quarters now. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 for MSFT’s EPS is up 5% year over year (read more: Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?).\n\nKey MU Tailwind: Optimism About HBM Chips\n\nIncreasing demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) has led the company to use its full production capacity and is expected to boost the bottom line. Management noted that revenues from the HBM market are estimated to be $86 billion by 2030 from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nNVIDIA’s AI graphic cards also use Micron’s HBM chips, so the demand is expected to improve. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 for MU’s EPS is up 160.3% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Death Cross for MU Stock: Time to Buy Micron Based on Fundamentals?).\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVDA, MSFT, MU\n\nGiven the positives, well-known brokers have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 28.8% from the stock’s last closing price of $115.59. Analysts’ highest price target is $200, an upside of 73%.\n\nProminent brokers have also increased MSFT’s average short-term price target by 14.8% from the stock’s last closing price of $435.15. The highest price target is $600, an upside of 37.9%.\n\nMU’s average short-term price target, too, has been raised 74.4% from the stock’s last closing price of $88.73. The highest price target is $225, an upside of 153.6%.\n\nOver the past year, the shares of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron have soared 168.4%, 34.3%, and 25.4%, respectively.\n\nAll these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): Best Forever Stock To Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\n\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\n\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\n\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\n\nSource: pexels\n\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\n\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\n\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\n\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\n\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors. We analyzed the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, focusing on high-quality US stocks with strong competitive advantages. We ranked the top 10 based on market cap and hedge fund holdings.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 179\n\nMarket Cap as of September 18, 2024: $2.84 Trillion\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the best forever stock to buy now for anyone eyeing exposure in the burgeoning artificial intelligence space. The company provides graphics computing and networking solutions. Nevertheless, the strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPU) for gaming and AI models has propelled it into a trillion-dollar company.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as one of the best-performing stocks, rallying by over 2,000% over the past five years. Despite the blockbuster gains, the company is still in the early years of growth given that the AI race is just but starting.\n\nThe fact that the semiconductor powerhouse remains the go-to company for chips to power artificial intelligence models and data centers affirms the tremendous opportunities for growth. To date, the need for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and various semiconductors has been overwhelming as cloud computing firms and other tech giants increase their investments in artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to maintain a lead in the market demand.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s clientele base for GPUs and other semiconductors includes some of the biggest tech giants, including Alphabet and Amazon Meta Platforms, among others. The solid clientele list has been the catalyst behind the company’s record-breaking financial results.\n\nThe company remains in a solid financial position, exiting the second quarter with a net income of $16.5 billion, up from $6.2 billion as of last year. Consequently, it had announced plans to return $50 billion through buybacks, affirming why it is one of the best forever stocks to buy now. Additionally, it rewards investors with a 0.03% dividend yield.\n\nBuying Nvidia’s stock at a forward P/E of approximately 41 and a PEG ratio slightly over 0.7 remains a good deal for a firm experiencing triple-digit revenue increases. In total, 179 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter.\n\nIthaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy mentioned the following about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life",
        "content": "Back in the dot-com boom era, stock splits became commonplace in response to soaring share prices. Amid the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom, a similar pattern could be developing. Already, several AI companies have split their shares, and more splits could be on the way among the others that are trading at lofty prices.\n\nInvestors should understand that stock splits don't fundamentally change the value of a stock or the underlying business, but they usually come in the wake of significant share price appreciation, and signal management's confidence that the stock can keep going higher.\n\nThere's also evidence, according to a Bank of America study, that stocks outperform in the year after they split. While there's no guarantee that any given stock-split stock will beat the S&P 500, it does offer historical evidence that the average stock-split stock does. On that note, these three AI stock-split stocks look like long-term winners. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) needs little introduction at this point. The AI chip superstar has paced the sector, gaining roughly 700% since the start of 2023. Nvidia's most recent stock split -- a 10-for-1 split -- took effect after the market closed on June 7, and the stock is down since then.\n\nNvidia continues to show a lot of upside potential even as its market cap is now hovering just shy of $3 trillion. The company has a huge lead in data center GPUs, the cutting-edge chips needed to power AI models like ChatGPT, and it seems likely that its lead will only get wider following the launch of chips built on its new Blackwell platform in the fourth quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the company is on pace to keep growing rapidly; revenue rose 122% year over year in its fiscal 2025 second quarter to $30 billion.\n\nWhile some investors are concerned about the possibility of an AI sector bubble, there's still plenty of evidence that demand for Nvidia's components is soaring. The latest anecdote to support that theory: Reportedly, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to dinner so that they could beg him in person to sell their companies more GPUs.\n\nGiven its entrenched competitive advantages, surging demand for its wares, and a long development path ahead in generative AI, Nvidia still looks like a smart buy.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is another breakout AI stock. Like Nvidia, its revenue has soared, up 144% in its most recent quarter to $5.31 billion. However, the company's gross margin declined, weighing on profits, and the market bid the stock downward.\n\nStory continues\n\nLater, Supermicro shares plunged after a short-seller attacked the company, and management said its annual 10-K would be delayed. CEO Charles Liang responded to the short-seller's charges, saying that business remains strong. Importantly, he also said that despite the filing delay, the company doesn't anticipate any material changes to its financial results from what it previously reported.\n\nSupermicro is known for manufacturing high-density servers that perform especially well in AI applications, and it's dominating the market for liquid-cooled AI servers, giving it a competitive advantage.\n\nA great reason to buy the stock now is Supermicro's valuation. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 22, which looks like a dramatic undervaluation, assuming neither of those two issues is material.\n\nSupermicro's 10-for-1 stock split is scheduled for Oct. 1. That event could be a catalyst for the stock's rebound.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) business is diversified across cybersecurity, virtualization software, semiconductors, and networking infrastructure. It doesn't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia and Supermicro do, but it's seeing growing demand due to the new technology thanks in part to its switches, networking solutions, and custom accelerators for AI data centers.\n\nCEO Hock Tan said he expected the company's revenue from AI to reach $12 billion this year -- roughly a quarter of its total sales.\n\nThe tech giant also has a long track record of success in growing its business both organically and through acquisitions, in which it typically cuts costs to drive profits higher. In its most recent fiscal quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $8.2 billion. That amounted to 63% of its total revenue, a ratio that's nearly as good as Nvidia's.\n\nBroadcom executed a 10-for-1 stock split on July 12, and its stock has edged down since then along with the rest of the AI sector. Currently, Broadcom trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 37, a reasonable level for an AI leader whose profitability should improve as it completes the integration of its massive VMware acquisition.\n\nAll three of these AI stocks have delivered strong results and look poised to continue doing so. With strong competitive advantages, huge growth opportunities, and affordable valuations, they all look like smart long-term buys.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar in the Remainder of 2024",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024, but it has been in a slump since mid-July as investors digested some potential headwinds.\n\nThere was a rumored delay with the company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the data center, which are responsible for the majority of the company's revenue. Analysts have also questioned how long Nvidia's top customers will continue spending billions of dollars on their AI aspirations.\n\nHowever, those concerns might have been put to rest over the last few weeks. Here's why Nvidia stock could soar to new highs before the end of 2024.\n\nAll eyes are on the new Blackwell GPUs\n\nNvidia's flagship H100 graphics processor (GPU) for the data center set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can handle multiple tasks at once while maintaining a high throughput. They also have built-in memory so they are ideal for processing large volumes of data, which is critical when training AI models and performing AI inference.\n\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, data center operators could spend $1 trillion building GPU infrastructure over the next few years. That presents a substantial opportunity, which is why the company continues to design new chips with more processing power and better energy efficiency to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nNvidia is now shipping its new H200 GPU, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100, while consuming half the amount of electricity. But the company recently unveiled an entirely new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which promises an even greater leap in performance.\n\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference at a staggering 30 times the pace of the equivalent H100 system. Each individual GB200 GPU will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which is similar to what many customers originally paid for the H100, so it's going to drive an incredible improvement in cost efficiency. As a result, demand is likely to significantly outstrip supply.\n\nIn fact, Huang says Blackwell GPUs will bring in billions of dollars in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (which begins in November) as the company ramps up shipments to customers, squashing previous rumors that the new chips could be delayed by months.\n\nMany of Nvidia's top customers are begging for more GPUs\n\nHuang says data center operators can earn $5 in revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on GPUs, by renting the computing power to AI developers. That's why the world's largest cloud providers, like Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle, are clamoring to get their hands on as many chips as possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther technology companies also want more chips to develop AI for their own purposes. Tesla is aiming to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online by the end of 2024 to further train its AI-based self-driving software. Meta Platforms wants to have a whopping 600,000 H100 equivalents in action by the end of the year to train the next iteration of its Llama large language models (LLMs), which will power new AI features on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Nvidia can't keep up with demand. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison said he recently went to dinner with Huang, alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He and Musk apparently begged Huang to take more of their money for additional GPUs.\n\nIt's no surprise supply is tight. Microsoft alone spent over $55 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), most of which went toward AI data center infrastructure and chips. Similarly, Amazon says its capex spending will top $60 billion in calendar 2024.\n\nThat's how Nvidia was able to generate a record $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28) alone, which was up 154% from the year-ago period. The result could have been even stronger if not for supply constraints. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia stock looks cheap based on its future potential earnings\n\nNvidia stock is currently trading 15% below its record high, but I think it will recover that ground (and then some) in the coming months.\n\nBased on the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $2.20, its stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52.5. That's considerably more expensive than the tech sector as a whole, as represented by the 30.8 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100.\n\nHowever, the stock market is a forward-looking machine and Nvidia's fiscal 2026 begins at the end of January 2025, which is only a few months away. I think investors will soon start pricing the stock based on its potential earnings in the new year.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to deliver $4.02 in earnings per share during fiscal 2026, which places its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 28.7. From that perspective, it actually looks quite cheap!\n\nMicrosoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms are just some of the companies that have explicitly said they will increase their capex spending on AI in the coming year. Since they are among Nvidia's biggest customers, it reduces some of the uncertainty surrounding Nvidia's potential financial results next year. Therefore, I predict Nvidia stock will surpass its record closing high of $135.58 by the end of 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Dreamforce Is Primarily Beneficial For Hardware Manufacturers Like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) stands against Jim Cramer's other must-watch stocks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what’s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There’s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That’s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\n\nLook, I know this is Mad Money, not Mad AI. On a day like today, I could just focus on the Fed and only the Fed, whether we'll get a quarter percent rate hike or maybe a half percent rate tomorrow. Today, the averages whipped around, finishing off 16 points, the S&P ending up 0.3%, and the NASDAQ inching up 2%. Stocks were all over the place.\"\n\nMaximizing Profit Potential Through Lower Rates and AI Innovation\n\nCramer emphasized that we don’t need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to drop, which is crucial for sustaining a bull market. He urged viewers not to overthink the situation and instead focus on promising opportunities, especially in the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don’t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that’s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I’d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\n\nWhile AI is causing excitement in the stock market, Cramer observed that its impact on the overall economy has been minimal so far. Some applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, exist, but they aren’t groundbreaking. This lack of significant progress has led many analysts to suggest that the hype around AI may be turning into a bubble.\n\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We’ve heard so much about this technology and how it’s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn’t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings—nothing flashy. That’s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer explained that AI, particularly when paired with advanced computing from chip giants, can greatly enhance efficiency by allowing machines to perform tasks intelligently, similar to skilled humans. He pointed out that businesses strive to produce quality products, but a worker shortage, exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, has hindered their ability to connect with customers effectively. Sales associates often end up rushed and confused, which affects the customer experience.\n\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Businesses want to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes—that’s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\n\nThat became apparent during COVID. We can’t interact effectively because our sales associates are too busy to be anything but brisk or confused. They’re harried from the moment they come in to the moment they leave. It’s a late-stage capitalist directive. What can I say? What doctor has time to talk to you? What nurse practitioner can give you the time of day?\"\n\nElevating Customer Service Through Advanced AI Agents\n\nCramer highlighted that companies are pushing their employees hard for profits, creating a stressful work environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, Cramer recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage customers in a friendly manner, using personalized data to answer common questions efficiently.\n\nCramer believes AI is a great solution for customer service, offering clear assistance without the frustrations that often come from overwhelmed human employees. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries independently.\n\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond to your data. It knows your preferences.\n\nThis is the perfect way to handle customer interactions instead of relying on humans who can be unclear, impatient, or exhausted. Humans are, well, human, harried and ready to go home. But machines infused with AI are delightful, smart, and engaging. They don’t mind going to work, and that’s where these AI agents come in. The machines can listen, reason, and either direct you to the right place or handle everything themselves.\"\n\nHe further explained that AI enhances customer experiences by remembering preferences, helping with returns, and suggesting alternatives based on past purchases. This reduces the need for interaction with human salespeople who may be stressed or impatient. If customers remain unsatisfied, they still have the option to speak to a human, but many might prefer friendly interaction with an AI agent.\n\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It’s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you’re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to, but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\n\nRevolutionizing Everyday Life: How AI Outperforms Humans in Healthcare, Driving, and Beyond\n\nCramer also predicted that in ten years, people might wonder why they relied on human doctors when AI could provide more compassionate and effective care. These AI systems could analyze vast amounts of medical data to quickly identify serious health issues, making it easier to catch dangerous patterns before they escalate.\n\n\"It’s not just retail. In ten years, I think we’ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor’s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic, like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It’s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\n\nAdditionally, Cramer noted that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He mentioned that AI can handle tasks like proofreading without making mistakes, allowing law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They’re much safer than human drivers. They don’t drink and drive, they don’t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\n\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents generally outperform humans in most scenarios. For repetitive tasks, he believes it’s preferable to engage with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed human who may not want to help.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you’d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn’t want to deal with you.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article provides a summary of Jim Cramer's latest episode of Mad Money, where he reviewed several stocks. We picked 12 companies and ranked them based on how much they are owned by hedge funds, starting with the ones that are least owned and moving to those that are most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nJim Cramer discussed his observations from Dreamforce, noting that AI isn't a magic solution for major problems like curing cancer or creating new products. Instead, it's primarily beneficial for hardware manufacturers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\n\"At Dreamforce, AI is not just a strategy; it doesn't cure cancer, create products to sell, or even generate numbers for anyone except the companies that manufacture the underlying hardware, that includes AMD. For everyone else, including the hyperscalers, AI is just a necessary expense to keep up with the Joneses. Kind of pathetic, isn’t it? But I found out otherwise today.\"\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is based on its strong position in fast-growing areas like data centers and artificial intelligence. As the need for high-performance computing rises, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s EPYC processors and Radeon graphics cards are seeing increased sales, outperforming competitors such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA). The successful launch of the Ryzen 7000 series further strengthens Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s market presence.\n\nPartnerships with major cloud providers like\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:GOOG), boost its use in enterprise solutions. Additionally, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a 30% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $5.3 billion in Q2 2024, highlighting its financial strength. Its leading role in the gaming console market ensures a steady income, while ongoing investments in AI capabilities promise future growth.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs,9 GPUs, FPGAs,10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace.\n\nAMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads.\n\nSimultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.”\n\nOverall AMD ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's must-watch stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock Headed to $10 Trillion by 2030, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "There's no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has generated a lot of buzz since early last year. Recent technological advances have taken these algorithms to the next level, enabling them to generate original content of all stripes, improve productivity, and streamline processes.\n\nCompanies on the leading edge of this trend have profited from these advances in technology. In fact, six of the world's seven most valuable companies, when measured by market cap, have embraced the paradigm shift of generative AI and staked their claims to profits from these next-generation systems. Topping the charts are Apple and Microsoft, the only two companies that currently boast a market cap of more than $3 trillion.\n\nHowever, one company that appears ordained to make a name for itself as a founding member of the $10 trillion club is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The pioneer in graphics processing units (GPUs) is nipping at the heels of the current leaders with a market cap of $2.8 trillion but seems destined to break new ground.\n\nLet's look at the numerous growth drivers that could send Nvidia stock to new heights. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nShall we play a game?\n\nNvidia revolutionized gaming a quarter of a century ago when the company pioneered the GPU, which produced lifelike images in video games. The secret to its success is parallel processing, or the ability of these advanced chips to process a multitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously. It wasn't long before Nvidia realized the vast potential of this discovery and pivoted to tailor this technology to a host of other applications.\n\nThe company has since adapted GPUs to power cloud computing, data centers, machine learning, autonomous driving, generative AI, and more.\n\nThe tale of the tape\n\nOver the past 10 years, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 2,350% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged 9,490%. While it hasn't all been in a straight line, the company's consistently strong performance has driven impressive growth in its stock price, which has soared 23,110%.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year over year and 15% sequentially. This drove diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67 up 168%. The star of the show was the data center segment, which includes processors used for cloud computing, data centers, and -- of course -- AI. Revenue for the segment surged 154% to $26.3 billion, driven by insatiable demand for AI.\n\nThere's likely much more demand ahead. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research estimate the economic impact of AI at $7 trillion by 2030. Furthermore, the improving macroeconomic backdrop could help accelerate adoption, which would be a boon to Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot a one-trick pony\n\nThere's no question that AI is currently Nvidia's biggest opportunity, but it's far from the only one.\n\nLet's not forget that, until recently, GPUs for gaming were the company's cash cow, while AI played second fiddle. During the economic downturn, many gamers made do with their existing processors, waiting for the specter of inflation to subside. As the economic outlook continues to improve and graphics cards come to the end of their useful lives, there's plenty of pent-up demand that could fuel a long overdue upgrade cycle, and Nvidia stands to benefit the most.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia controlled 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research. Furthermore, demand is expected to soar over the coming five years, jumping from $3.6 billion in 2024 to $15.7 billion by 2029, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34%, according to Mordor Intelligence. The market for gaming processors is ripe for a recovery, a trend that benefits Nvidia.\n\nThere's also the data center market, which will be driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing. Many businesses are moving their data to the cloud, foregoing on-site storage, another trend that favors Nvidia. It controls an estimated 95% of the data center GPU market, according to Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.\n\nIt's estimated that the data center market will climb from $302 billion in 2024 to $622 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 10%, according to data provided by Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research.\n\nNvidia's supremacy and the growing market puts the company in the pole position of another opportunity. Generative AI isn't the only game in town. The company has a virtual monopoly in the machine learning market, an established branch of AI. The company controls an estimated 95% share of that market, according to New Street Research.\n\nThere are other areas that aren't material to Nvidia's growth but could eventually make a meaningful contribution. Self-driving cars aren't yet ready for prime time, and quantum computing is still largely experimental, but either could be a catalyst for the next stage of Nvidia's growth.\n\nThis helps illustrate the point that while generative AI is at the heart of Nvidia's recent run-up, other opportunities abound.\n\nThe path to $10 trillion\n\nNvidia currently sports a market cap of roughly $2.78 trillion, which means it will take stock-price gains of 260% to drive its value to $10 trillion. According to Wall Street, Nvidia is poised to generate revenue of nearly $113 billion in fiscal 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of roughly 24.7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Nvidia would need to grow its revenue to roughly $405 billion annually to support a $10 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Nvidia of 47% annually over the next five years. If the company reaches that watermark, it could achieve a $10 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. But don't take my word for it. Beth Kindig, CEO and lead tech analyst of the I/O Fund, has an estimate that's eerily similar:\n\nWe believe Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030 or sooner through a rapid product road map, it's impenetrable moat from the CUDA software platform, and due to being an AI systems company that provides components well beyond GPUs, including networking and software platforms.\n\nGiven the company's multiple avenues for growth and the accelerating adoption of AI, I think Kindig hit the nail on the head.\n\nThere's a caveat, of course. Given Nvidia's parabolic rise since early last year, any weakness by the company -- real or perceived -- could crush the stock price, at least temporarily. We've seen an example just recently when Nvidia lost nearly a quarter of its value over six weeks between June and July, as investors became skittish about rumors of a delay in the release of its next-generation Blackwell platform.\n\nThat said, I would submit that 36 times forward earnings is a reasonable price to pay for a company at the cutting edge of one of the biggest paradigm shifts in technology in a generation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Federico Maccioni\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates-based artificial intelligence company G42 has teamed up with U.S. chipmaker Nvidia to work on climate tech, G42 said on Friday, ahead of the first-ever visit to the White House by a president of the UAE next week.\n\nThe Gulf-based company said in a statement the two firms would work together develop AI solutions aimed at boosting weather forecasting accuracy globally and will set up an operational base and climate tech lab in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe UAE, led by government-backed G42, is investing heavily in AI to help diversify its economy away from oil and UAE-based companies have forged several deals with U.S. firms recently.\n\nMicrosoft announced in April it was investing $1.5 billion in G42, while this week the two firms said they would open two centres in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAbu Dhabi-backed investment company MGX is also joining as a general partner in a $30 billion fund with BlackRock and Microsoft to invest in AI infrastructure.\n\nStill, Washington has been increasingly concerned about the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries becoming a conduit for advanced U.S. AI technology reaching China. Last year it imposed new curbs on AI chip exports, imposing a licensing requirement on their shipment to these countries.\n\nUAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is scheduled to visit Washington on Monday.\n\nHe will meet U.S. President Joe Biden and discuss Middle East regional security issues as well as advanced technology and AI development, the White House said.\n\nHe is also set to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris as well as business executives, Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE's president told journalists in a briefing on Thursday, adding that the main focus of the visit would be economy and cooperation in fields such as AI.\n\n\"Sometimes people like to talk about some tensions in the relationship, but the big story is that this is our most important strategic relationship,\" Gargash said.\n\n(Reporting by Federico Maccioni)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Reports ‘Nvidia Shares Are Lower Monday’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Top Stock Picks: 10 Stocks with High Potential. In this article, we will have a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among the 10 stocks with high potential.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains the current split between tech stocks and other sectors, noting that they often move in opposite directions. For instance, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points and the S&P 500 rose by 0.13%, the NASDAQ—which is heavily weighted with tech stocks—fell by 0.52%.\n\n“How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ—with all that tech in it—dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?”\n\nAs a result, large institutions must shift investments between sectors since they can’t invest in both simultaneously. This situation is driven by market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already performing well, attracting new investment is challenging, especially when safer investments offer decent returns. Consequently, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both at the same time.\n\n“It’s because there’s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it’s not about the news, it’s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it’s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there’s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.”\n\nMarket Shuffle: Winners vs. Losers and the Fed’s Big Decision\n\nCramer points out that this scenario leads to clear winners and losers instead of a spectrum of performance on a positive day. This is happening alongside uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting.\n\n“What happens? We get winners and losers—not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\n\nNow, you know me, I try to refrain from this parlor game of guessing the Fed’s next move based on the strength of the economy. Last week, when *The Wall Street Journal* indicated the Fed may actually be leaning toward 50 basis points, we saw this great migration into cyclicals, especially anything related to housing. Of course, last week, there was just enough good news to propel the entire market, which is why it was the best week of the year.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer also mentions that despite his tendency to avoid speculating on the Fed’s actions, recent market movements have been influenced by expectations about rate cuts. For instance, when The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Fed might opt for a 50 basis point cut, there was a significant shift toward cyclical stocks, especially those linked to housing. This shift, combined with other positive news, led to the best week of the year for the market.\n\n“This leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that’s how this market seems to be trading. It’s a big reason why I’m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn’t believe in AI, AI, or tech in general, for that matter. It’s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.”\n\n“Anything But Tech”\n\nJim Cramer observed that Monday’s market saw a broadening of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all performed well. Even oil stocks, which have been struggling, are making a comeback. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rally, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would decline. However, Cramer attributes this trend to a broader market shift he refers to as “ABT,” which stands for “anything but tech.” In other words, today’s market focus is on sectors outside of technology.\n\n“Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It’s crazy—healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that’s not what’s happening because it’s *ABT*. No, I’m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means “anything but tech,” and that’s what today’s market was about.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article provides a summary of Jim Cramer’s latest Morning Thoughts, where he reviewed several stocks. We’ve chosen the ten most noteworthy companies he mentioned and ranked them according to how much they are owned by hedge funds, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are down on Monday, but this appears to be just profit-taking after the AI chipmaker’s stock surged nearly 16% last week.\n\n“Nvidia shares are lower Monday. It looks like nothing more than profit-taking after the leading AI chipmaker surged nearly 16% last week.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) presents a strong investment opportunity due to its leading role in the growing AI and data center markets. In Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $30 billion, a 122% increase from the previous year, driven by a 154% surge in its data center segment. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs are essential for AI applications, positioning Nvidia to capitalize on the AI boom.\n\nIts advancements in both hardware and software reinforce its dominance in the tech industry. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s key presence in high-demand areas like data centers and autonomous systems, combined with its leadership in AI and machine learning, suggests strong potential for ongoing revenue growth and high profit margins. This makes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) an attractive long-term investment.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks with high potential. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is teaming up with Abu Dhabi-based G42 to create a climate technology lab, marking its first partnership with the United Arab Emirates’ top artificial intelligence firm.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density\n\nThe two companies will work on developing AI that can improve the accuracy of weather forecasting, according to a statement Friday. They will rely on Nvidia’s Earth-2, an open platform that can make climate and weather predictions.\n\nThe climate tech lab, located in Abu Dhabi, “will serve as a hub for research and development, driving forward both companies’ commitment to environmental sustainability,” according to the statement. It will also “mobilize the creation of tailored climate and weather solutions that leverage over 100 petabytes of geophysical data assets.”\n\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of an artificial intelligence spending boom, has been speeding up development of new products and expanding its footprint. Back in June, the company said it now plans to upgrade its AI accelerators every year. Its road map includes a new Blackwell lineup coming around the end of the year and a next-generation platform in development called Rubin for 2026.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jensen Huang also has promoted the use of so-called digital twins — virtual versions of real-life things — in an online realm that Nvidia calls the Omniverse. Earth-2, a digital twin of planet Earth, is meant to show the potential of the approach by enabling more sophisticated weather-pattern modeling and other complex tasks.\n\n“The Earth-2 climate tech lab will propel environmental solutions using the most advanced accelerated computing and AI technology,” Huang said in the statement.\n\nEarlier this year, G42 lined up a $1.5 billion investment from Microsoft Corp. after the two worked out a deal with the US government where the UAE-based company agreed to end any cooperation with China. The firms announced this week that they are establishing two centers in Abu Dhabi focused on helping develop industry standards for the use of AI.\n\nG42 also has a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which is looking to expand in the Gulf region.\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia helps bolster the UAE’s case that it can become an AI superpower in the Middle East. It’s part of the $1.5 trillion empire of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is one of Abu Dhabi’s deputy rulers, national security adviser for the UAE and brother to its president.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe partnership with Nvidia will pave the way to “not only innovate but also solve critical global challenges,” said Peng Xiao, G42’s CEO.\n\nUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan is visiting Washington next week to meet President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. A main goal of his trip is to bring up partnerships in AI and in technology, a senior Emirati official said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success How a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

Recently, Su highlighted AMD's shift away from flagship gaming GPUs to focus on AI, projecting $4.5 billion in MI300X AI chip sales for 2024. She emphasized that AMD's AI roadmap includes the annual release of new AI chips, starting with the MI325 later this year, followed by the MI350 in 2025 and the MI400 in 2026. This move aims to challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI chip technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe competition is heating up as both companies vie for a larger share of the AI market. As of Sep. 13, AMD's stock has risen 39.98% over the past year, while Nvidia's has surged 161.90%. Year-to-date, AMD is up 8.80%, and Nvidia has soared 147.33%. Nvidia's first-mover advantage in the AI space has helped it amass a market cap of over $2.9 trillion, with AMD trailing at around $245 billion.\n\nInterest Rates Are Falling, But These Yields Aren't Going Anywhere\n\nLower interest rates mean some investments won't yield what they did in months past, but you don't have to lose those gains.

        "title": "Semiconductor Market Still Overvalued: 2 Stocks to Watch",
        "content": "Companies in the Semiconductor – General industry are at the forefront of the ongoing technological revolution based on HPC, AI, electrified and automated driving, IoT and so forth. The semiconductors they produce enable the cloud to function and help analyze data into actionable insights that can be used by companies to operate more efficiently.\r\n\r\nGiven the strong growth outlook, share prices continue to soar, leading to rich valuations. Despite this, companies like SCREEN Holdings (DINRF) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and are worth considering.\r\n \r\nWhile there were initially some negative forecasts from economists and market watchers alike, 2023 turned out to be stronger than initially expected and a recession if any this year is also likely to be mild. Semiconductors and technology in general perhaps constitute one of the pillars balancing out an otherwise moderate economy.\r\n\r\nThe latest data coming out of WSTS, which is also typically quoted by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), has global semiconductor sales growing double-digits this year, with memory doing most of the heavy-lifting with its 76.8% increase. It is expected logic would also do its part, with a 10.7% increase being nothing to scoff at.\r\n\r\nAs expected, the Americas will be one of the bright spots this year. With US GDP expected to come in at an optimistic 2.6%, the difference is clear for all to see. Garter also sees a 17.4% increase this year coming on top of an 11.7% decline last year with memory being the main driver. IDC hasn’t refreshed its estimate of 20% growth in 2024, although it has identified HBM and AI PCs as the major drivers followed by recovery in auto and industrial demand in the second half of the year.\r\n \r\nAs far as end-markets are concerned, growth in PCs and smartphones will come from new AI-enabled versions starting this year. PC growth will also be driven by the end of support for Windows 10. Commercial and enterprise deployment should also increase as a recession if any is likely to be mild.\r\n\r\nDriven by Internet connectivity across the developed and developing worlds and supportive technology such as sensor networks and AI adoption, the IoT market is also expected to grow steadily over the next few years. Future Market Insights expects the industrial IoT segment alone to grow at a 12.1% CAGR between 2023 and 2033.\r\n\r\nAuto electrification, structural changes in industrial automation, data center strength, generative AI and custom chips for cloud services are expected to drive multi-year growth in semiconductors. While in the past, memory demand has been tied to PCs and servers, which is the main reason for the pandemic-related imbalance in 2023, auto and other applications will accelerate in the coming years.\r\n \r\nThe government’s target of reducing dependence on China, and onshoring projects with national security implications will shape the future of this industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout The Industry\n\nThe companies grouped under the Semiconductor – General category produce a broad range of semiconductor devices, both integrated and discrete, like microprocessors, graphics processors, embedded processors, chipsets, motherboards, wireless and wired connectivity products, DLPs and analog, serving multiple end markets. It includes companies like NVIDIA, Texas Instruments, Intel and STMicroelectronics.\n\nMajor Themes Shaping the Industry\n\nThe long-term outlook for the industry has been robust for a while now because of its being on the building-block side of technology, which makes it crucial for the proliferation of the Internet and the ongoing digitization of every aspect of life. However, throughout this year, the short-term outlook has continued to brighten. With interest rates starting to come down and demand side factors such as inflation coming under control, we can finally focus on industry specific issues. These too are looking up with the inventory imbalance corrected, AI-enabled end point devices coming to market this year, surging infrastructure demand stemming from the rapid adoption of generative AI and continued acceleration of electronics adoption in a faster-growing defense market. While global economies are only gradually returning to normal, geopolitical concerns should not be considered totally negative for the industry, as weapon sales are accelerating the world over.\n\nThere is continued strength in emerging areas like AI and machine learning, IoT, and automotive. Data-intensive applications, advancements in machine learning algorithms and increasing urbanization, as well as dynamics in the auto and financial services markets are the major drivers. Automotive electronics is an area of evolving needs, as the world continues to move toward EVs and hybrids. The most important growth segments for semiconductors are likely to be ADAS, infotainment and electronic control units (ECUs) with safety and fuel efficiency being top concerns. Automation and robotics, with increasing adoption across industrial operations, are other areas of growth. It is hard to set any figure as an expected growth rate, as these expectations continue to accelerate rapidly. Suffice it to say that emerging areas will drive strong double-digit growth for this industry over the next decade.\n\nSemiconductor supply chains are adjusting. Semiconductor supply chains have become increasingly efficient over the years. While this has brought down cost, the just-in-time model has made the supply chains relatively unreliable in case of external disruptions, as happened during the pandemic, or when China imposed its zero tolerance COVID shutdowns. This, along with other factors, such as the U.S.-imposed restraints on dealing with China is leading semiconductor companies to diversify their supply chains and reduce their dependence on the country. This is an ongoing process that will take several years. In the meantime, there is a growing concern that all the most important leading-edge chips are currently made in Taiwan, a country that China threatens to annex all the time. Since this has national security implications, there is an ongoing drive to onshore manufacturing. The CHIPS Act is facilitating the process.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Risks Despite Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Semiconductor-General Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #177, which places it in the bottom 29% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates that near-term prospects are moderate. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nAn industry’s positioning in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is normally because the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate is relatively strong. The opposite is true for stocks in the bottom 50% of industries. In this case, the aggregate earnings estimate for 2024 is up 33.5% from the year-ago level while the aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is up 78.8% from last year.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nStock Market Performance Remains Strong\n\nTracking the performance of the Zacks Semiconductor – General Industry over the past year shows that the industry has traded at a premium to both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector and the S&P 500 index throughout the year with a sizeable bump-up through May and the first half of June.\n\nThe industry has gained 122.4% over the past year. The broader technology sector gained 32.7% while the S&P 500 index gained 26.2%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCurrent Valuation: Rich\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 36.76X multiple, which is its median value over the past year. However, since the S&P 500 trades at 21.55X while the sector trades at 25.94X, the industry appears significantly overvalued.\n\nIts worth noting that the industry has traded much closer to the sector in the last 10 years, trailing it at first then slightly beating it. But it has really pulled ahead from the middle of 2022, most likely because companies are scrambling to acquire the basic building blocks for AI, autonomous driving, defense and other mega trends driving the market today.\n\nForward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\n2 Stocks to Consider\n\nThe industry continues to look good and it will benefit from further interest cuts this year, which typically drives more money into risky assets. Several of the technology heavyweights in this industry are the backbone of how computing is done these days, so we remain optimistic over the long run. The only stumbling block is the valuation. We continue to like DINRF and NVDA:\n\nSCREEN Holdings Co Ltd. (DINRF):\n\nHeadquartered in Kyoto, SCREEN Holdings develops, manufactures, sells and maintains semiconductor production equipment in Japan.\n\nSCREEN Holdings’ earnings estimate for the year ending Mar 2025 increased 23 cents (4.7%) in the last 60 days while its 2025 estimate increased 20 cents (3.6%).\n\nThe shares of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have appreciated 45.4% over the past year.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance: DINRF Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): Santa Clara, CA-based NVIDIA provides graphics, and compute and networking solutions in the U.S., Taiwan, China and other markets. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the most popular in the gaming segment. NVIDIA is also at the leading edge of enterprise, data center, cloud and automotive deployments today.\n\nGenerative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements. Because NVIDIA’s accelerated computing is versatile, energy-efficient and has low total cost of ownership, companies are rapidly transitioning to its products to train and deploy AI. NVIDIA GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines. They are opening up opportunities and leading to broad-based growth across geographies and markets.\n\nThe automotive, financial services, healthcare and telecom verticals are particularly strong, as AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation road maps and competitive positioning. The data center business is the strongest right now, driven by demand for data processing, training and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies.\n\nNVIDIA is also seeing momentum across professional visualization and automotive. The company also gives away billions to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal the fiscal year ending January 2025 is up 11 cents (4.1%) in the last 30 days and up 33 cents (9.8%) for the following year.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Neutral) rated stock is up 173.6% in the past year.\n\nPrice & Consensus: NVDA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia, AMD stocks lead tech rally after Fed rate cut",
        "content": "AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the tech stock rally Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s sizable, 50 basis point interest rate cut. Nvidia stock jumped more than 5% while its rival Advanced Micro Devices saw shares rise as much as 7% in afternoon trading.\n\nThe rising stock prices illustrate that investors are absorbing — and believing — Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s message that the US economy is “in good shape.” The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the stock market’s upward trajectory. The index was up 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.8% and the Dow (^DJI) climbed 1.3%.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven big tech stocks all posted gains. Meta (META) stock rose 4%; Apple (AAPL) jumped 3.7%. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) all bumped up nearly 2%. But the semiconductor subsector of the tech industry was a top gainer. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbed nearly 5%.\n\nNvidia’s climb is welcome news to investors who watched the stock’s rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. The chipmaker's shares fell after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings at the end of August, beating Wall Street’s expectations but lowering its projected gross margin for the full year.\n\nThe stock tumbled further upon news that the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia as the agency ramped up its antitrust investigation of the company. But it jumped again after CEO Jensen Huang successfully pitched investors on AI’s return on investment during a Goldman Sachs conference last week, and big names like Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have reportedly “begged” for more Nvidia AI chips.\n\nAnd while Nvidia’s stock price may be down about 12% from three months ago, it’s up a staggering 172% from this time last year. The semiconductor superpower has continued to benefit from the AI boom, which is proving to be more than just hype.\n\nAlthough Nvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, AMD is also a major beneficiary of the AI innovation wave. While the stock has faced ups and downs throughout the last year and has come down from record highs in March, shares are up nearly 55% from last year.\n\nAMD in late June posted second quarter profits up nearly 20% from the prior year. The company will report third quarter results in late October.\n\nThe semiconductor sector’s good day is a bright spot as it faces uncertainty with the US presidential election inching closer. Both presidential candidates’ tough-on-China stances would be bad news for American chip companies like Nvidia. The Biden administration has implemented tough export controls that ban Chinese companies from directly buying chips from Nvidia and AMD in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US introduced further restrictions regarding semiconductor and quantum computing exports earlier this month. In the meantime, Nvidia is working on a custom chip for Chinese customers that comply with current trade restrictions. Nvidia corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Courtesy NVIDIA/Handout via REUTERS (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nAnd despite an upbeat day, Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned that tech stocks' rise is slowing and that investors should take a barbell strategy.\n\n“What we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now,” he told Yahoo Finance Thursday. “It's beginning to decelerate.”\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA &amp; 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates",
        "content": "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates aggressively and penciled in further rate cuts by the end of the year. It slashed the benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75-5% for the first time since March 2020.\n\nInterest rates have been hovering at a 23-year high to combat relentless price pressures. However, signs of inflationary pressure have ebbed recently, giving the Fed all the more reason to cut interest rates aggressively and let investors know that the central bank is not behind the curve.\n\nA lower interest rate scenario may lead to stock gains for major artificial intelligence (AI) tech players like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Micron Technology, Inc. MU. This is because interest rate cuts reduce their borrowing costs and boost profit margins. Interest rate cuts also don’t disrupt the cash flows needed for growth initiatives to enhance shareholder’s wealth.\n\nBy the way, the euphoria about the AI revolution hasn’t faded. It’s here to stay and should drive the prices of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron northward. After all, NVIDIA provides technology for AI applications, Microsoft builds AI resources for its customers and Micron is a memory specialist. AI’s data centers require a lot of memory.\n\nAccording to Statista, the AI industry is expected to grow beyond $184 billion in 2024 and continue to expand until 2030, with an estimated market size of $826 billion (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\n\nEven so, let’s look at other reasons why NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron’s shares have more room to run.\n\nKey NVIDIA Tailwind: Supremacy in the GPU Space\n\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, as huge chunks of data are transferred from the central processing units to graphic processing units (GPU), NVIDIA will gain due to its bulk share in the GPU market. Precedence Research noted that the GPU market is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion in 2034 from $75.77 billion in the current year at a CAGR of 13.8%.\n\nSince developers rely more on the CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s GPUs have a wide competitive moat. NVIDIA’s data center GPU business revenues were $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.80 for NVDA’s earnings per share (EPS) is up 76.1% from the prior year (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey MSFT Tailwind: Azure Growth\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure and cloud services business has picked up steam, with revenues from this segment increasing 29% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure unit is expanding faster than Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has dominated the cloud computing market for quite some time.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure could soon overtake AWS since it has grown from half the size of AWS in 2019 to about three quarters now. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.04 for MSFT’s EPS is up 5% year over year (read more: Microsoft Unveils $60 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy MSFT Stock?). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey MU Tailwind: Optimism About HBM Chips\n\nIncreasing demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory chips (HBM) has led the company to use its full production capacity and is expected to boost the bottom line. Management noted that revenues from the HBM market are estimated to be $86 billion by 2030 from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nNVIDIA’s AI graphic cards also use Micron’s HBM chips, so the demand is expected to improve. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 for MU’s EPS is up 160.3% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Death Cross for MU Stock: Time to Buy Micron Based on Fundamentals?). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVDA, MSFT, MU\n\nGiven the positives, well-known brokers have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 28.8% from the stock’s last closing price of $115.59. Analysts’ highest price target is $200, an upside of 73%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nProminent brokers have also increased MSFT’s average short-term price target by 14.8% from the stock’s last closing price of $435.15. The highest price target is $600, an upside of 37.9%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMU’s average short-term price target, too, has been raised 74.4% from the stock’s last closing price of $88.73. The highest price target is $225, an upside of 153.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOver the past year, the shares of NVIDIA, Microsoft and Micron have soared 168.4%, 34.3%, and 25.4%, respectively.

        "title": "Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Rocketing Higher Today",
        "content": "Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.8% in the afternoon session as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets. While investors were expecting a reduction in rates from the US central bank, there was a bit of back and forth on whether the cut would be 25bps (a quarter percent) or 50bps (half a percent).\n\nThe Fed ended up slashing its policy rate by 50bps (0.5%) to 4.75%-5.00%. This marks the first rate reduction in roughly four years. As a reminder, the Fed--under Chair Jerome Powell--began raising rates to tackle inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic when a confluence of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and stimulus spending caused inflation to run hot.\n\nLooking forward, the Fed signaled that more cuts are possible in 2024/25. Putting it all together, the announcement and outlook provided a breath of fresh air and a clearer view of the Fed's monetary policy stance, which the market has been waiting for with bated breath. If there's anything the market doesn't like, it's uncertainty.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\n\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAMD’s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 20 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today’s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago, when the company gained 10.9% as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results.\n\nDuring its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter.\n\nThe strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications. Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nAMD is up 14.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $159.03 per share it is still trading 24.8% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,250.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Trading Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 5.2% in the morning session as markets roared back after an initially muted response to the Fed's rate cut, which sparked a renewed appetite for risk assets.

Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia’s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 24 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today’s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company gained 6.8% as markets rebounded (Nasdaq up 1.8%, S&P 500 up 0.8%) after shaking off the initial negative reaction to the August inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of August 2024 came in line with expectations, growing 0.2% month on month.\n\nA concerning aspect of the report lies in the core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices), which revealed a 0.3% increase from the previous month, slightly exceeding the expected 0.2% increase. Despite this, annual inflation seemed to be easing, rising by 2.5%, the lowest level since February 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is up 147% since the beginning of the year, but at $119.19 per share it is still trading 12.1% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $26,945.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says We Are at a ‘Moment of Confusion’ with NVIDIA (NVDA)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCommenting on the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, Jim Cramer said in a latest program on CNBC that the “double” rate cut was needed for the economy and it would help the housing market, industrials and companies catering to the “less well-off” households.\n\n“There really are two economies in this country. There is the one that needs lower interest rates because business is slowing and it’s harder to find a job and then there is one that says we don’t really care about where the stinking rates are. That’s who we can get a double rate cut today and still going lower.”\n\nCramer said he is currently in Silicon Valley and after talking to many companies, he feels tech companies do not care about interest rates since they are selling to businesses. Cramer said these technology companies are focused on innovation.\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about during his latest programs on CNBC. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about what he called the “complication” around understanding NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) technologies and plans.\n\nCramer said some people believe there is a “slowdown” around Nvidia, but he rejected that notion.\n\n“That’s just not true. There is no slowdown. What there is is a complication,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer specifically read a sentence from a latest release from Oracle about the company’s partnership with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to explain what is the complication:\n\n“New AI supercomputer, the largest in the cloud, to deliver up to 131,072 NVIDIA GPUs to enable customers to build, train, and inference AI at scale.”\n\nCramer said this sentence went “over his head” and he is trying to understand what that means.\n\n“We are now in the moment where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is too hard for people to understand and we need Jensen to explain it… So I’d say we are at a moment of confusion with Nvidia, not a moment of slowdown,” Cramer added.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Top Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Much of that owes to how the Dow is constituted — a committee selects the 30 components and weights them by price rather than market capitalization.\n\nThe overseers try to balance membership across sectors, so tech is represented, but to some degree by yesteryear’s titans: Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. The trio are all long-term underperformers among large-cap tech.\n\nThe omission of any true AI play after the technology has dominated market returns for nearly two years is again raising questions about the utility of the Dow average while also revitalizing the age-old parlor game of trying to guess when the committee will shuffle membership and how.\n\n“With AI, the economy is really going through a shift like the 90s with the Internet. I think the Dow is missing that theme,” said Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. That’s left the index “behind the curve,” she said. While Nvidia and Broadcom would be the most obvious AI-focused additions, the latter may be a better pick because it tends to be less volatile, Tengler said.\n\nThe lack of some high-flying tech stocks — and a lower allocation to the sector overall compared with the S&P 500 Index — helps explain why the Dow has lagged other gauges for years. Since the start of 2010, it has returned more than 470%, including dividends, compared with the S&P 500’s about 580% gain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is up more than 1,100%.\n\nTo be sure, The Dow isn’t intended to mirror the overall equity market, but rather act as a cross-section of American-based companies. Its methodology states that stock selection “is not governed by quantitative rules,” with names typically added “if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHamish Preston, head of US Equities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that the Dow’s eligibility criteria have evolved and are frequently reviewed. “They may well be adjusted over time depending on what the committee deems relevant to ensure that the indices remain relevant,” he said in an interview.\n\nThe Dow’s method for stock selection is unusual compared with other indexes. While the S&P 500 has a quarterly review process — and recently added two more AI-related stocks — the Dow’s committee has no set schedule to make adjustments. The last change occurred in February when Amazon and Uber Technologies replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance and JetBlue Airways. In adding Amazon, S&P Dow Jones Indices cited the “evolving nature of the American economy.”\n\nTo be sure, the index does have some exposure to AI already. Microsoft Corp. is integrating ChatGPT technology into its software products and has been a Dow component for almost 25 years. Apple Inc., which is making AI services a cornerstone of its newest iPhones, was added in 2015, a few years after it became the world’s most valuable company.\n\nBut with the biggest names in the burgeoning industry missing, some say changes are overdue.\n\n“It’s clear that the Dow is going to do something that reflects AI,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “They’re almost compelled to.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple is set to be warned by the European Union to open up its highly guarded iPhone operating system to rival technologies, or eventually risk significant fines. Ampere Computing LLC, the semiconductor startup backed by Larry Ellison’s Oracle Corp., is exploring a potential sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Elon Musk’s X skirted a ban of the social media network in Brazil though an automatic update of its software, an association of Brazilian internet providers said Wednesday. Japan’s Icom Inc., whose brand appears on walkie-talkies that exploded in Lebanon, said it halted production a decade ago of the model allegedly used in the attacks and is still investigating the situation. Nintendo Co. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Tokyo-based Pocketpair Inc., the maker of hit game Palworld, seeking an injunction and compensation for damages.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nEndava\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Man Who Made Nike Uncool Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "content": "S&P 500, Dow Jones Hit Record Highs: Magnificent 7 Add $400 Billion After Fed's Historic Interest Rate Cut\n\nBulls are stampeding across Wall Street on Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates for the first time in over four years.\n\nThe central bank’s bold move, a 50-basis-point cut, caught analysts off guard and sent the U.S. stock market to fresh record highs at the opening of Thursday’s session.\n\nThe S&P 500 soared to a new all-time high, reaching 5,700 points. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to an unprecedented 42,000 points.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose by 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.5%, although the Russell 2000, representing small-cap stocks, outperformed with a surge of over 2%.\n\nThe market rally was primarily driven by the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of the Magnificent Seven are recording daily gains ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, solidly in positive territory.\n\nChart: S&P 500 Hits Record Highs\n\nImage: Benzinga Pro\n\nStrong Labor Market Eases Slowdown Fears, Analysts Boost Rate-Cut Wagers\n\nThursday’s economic data further boosted investor confidence. Weekly jobless claims came in well below expectations, suggesting a lower-than-expected trend of rising unemployment.\n\nContinuing jobless claims also dropped more than expected, hinting at a potential absorption of long-term unemployed individuals into the job market.\n\nThis data alleviated concerns about rising unemployment and provided a more optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nWall Street analysts quickly adjusted their expectations following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. There is now growing anticipation of additional rate cuts, diverging from the cautious tone expressed in the Fed’s September “dot plot” and Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks during the press conference.\n\nNotably, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius revised his forecast from expecting a 25-basis-point cut at every other meeting to predicting a rate cut at every meeting. He even left the door open for a back-to-back 50-basis-point reduction in November.\n\nThursday’s 5 Top-Performing S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAmong the S&P 500, the top five performers as of 10 a.m. ET were:\n\nName 1-day Return Darden Restaurants, Inc.

        "title": "Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates",
        "content": "Major central banks have started lowering interest rates, with more cuts on the cards before the year is out, and investment experts say it's important to position your portfolios accordingly.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut in more than four years on Wednesday, reducing rates by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%, from a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nThe Bank of England decided to keep its base rate on hold at 5% on Thursday in its September meeting but the central bank already cut rates in August and is expected to announce two reductions before the end of 2024.\n\nAnd the European Central Bank announced its second rate cut of the year last week, lowering the key deposit rate to 3.5% from 3.75%.\n\nOther central banks have also started to bring rates down, including the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, Sweden's Riksbank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\n\nRead more: Bank of England holds interest rates at 5%\n\nCentral bankers have been monitoring inflation figures closely to help guide these decisions, as they want to ensure price growth continues to slow to a target level, which for many is 2%.\n\nIn the UK, inflation held steady at 2.2% in the year to August, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Eurozone inflation also fell to 2.2% in August, while price growth in the US slowed to 2.5% last month.\n\nHowever, rate setters also want to make sure they don't wait so long to cut rates, as this slows economies down and tips them into a downturn. Then central banks might start to make faster and bigger interest rate cuts.\n\nAs this cycle of lowering rates is now well underway, Hal Cook, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown says investors need to prepare their portfolios for these changes.\n\n\"Bonds are an obvious choice as their prices are very sensitive to changes in interest rates — as rates come down, their prices usually rise,\" he says. \"They have already rallied strongly over the last few months in anticipation of cuts, but likely still have further to go though, especially on a 12-month view.\"\n\nRead more: Pound hits two and a half-year high after Bank of England holds interest rate\n\nYields, or the income return, on bonds typically move inversely to prices. The yield on the 10-year government bond — known as a gilt — have ebbed lower recently and were trading at 3.85% on Thursday morning. The US 10-year government bond — which is called a Treasury — has also dipped over past few months and stood at 3.69% on Thursday.\n\nFund picks for rate cuts\n\nCook says that the managers of the Invesco Tactical Bond (0P0000MUWI.L) fund, Julien Eberhardt and Stuart Edwards, have recently been altering their investments to benefit from rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is best illustrated by their duration position which, at around seven years, is close to the highest it has been over the last 10 years in the fund,\" he says.\n\nDuration acts as a measure of how sensitive an investment is to interest rate changes and is measured in years, Cook says: \"The higher the duration value, the more sensitive the investment is to interest rate changes.\"\n\nOver one year, the fund has returned nearly 9%, beating its benchmark of the UK government bonds three-month generic bid yield of 5% and it has a yield of 3.4%.\n\nJonathan Moyes, head of investment research at the Wealth Club and manager of its portfolio service, highlights the Janus Henderson Strategic Bond (0P0001JUM5.L) fund as another option.\n\nRead more: What the Bank of England’s interest rate decision means for your mortgage\n\nHe says: \"The investment team, led by Jenna Barnard, are long term believers in 'secular stagnation' — the view that high levels of debt, ageing populations and tech driven disruption will drive developed economies to continue to grapple with the low growth, disinflationary environment that dominated markets before the pandemic and war in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"A return to secular stagnation would see a material move lower in interest rates,\" Moyes adds.\n\nHe says this views has informed the team's sizeable weighting to long-dated government bonds, given that these are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n\nMoyes says the Wealth Club team believe the fund would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lower-than-expected interest rate environment in its sector.\n\nOn a one-year basis the fund has generated a return of nearly 8%, below that of the 11% average delivered by its Investment Association (IA) strategic bond fund peer group. However, it has a distributing yield of 3.7%. Investors need to prepare their portfolios as rate cutting cycles get underway. (Imago, Imago)\n\nInfrastructure and property\n\nAnother type of investment that Moyes says is expected to perform well when interest rates fall is infrastructure.\n\nThe Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation (BIPC) invests in global assets, ranging from gas pipelines to a global container business and data centres.\n\nAs with all infrastructure assets, these investments have long lifespans, \"with cash flows that can stretch into the decades,\" says Moyes.\n\n\"Higher interest rates are bad news for long dated assets, the discount rates applied to those future cash flows are higher, and higher discount rates mean those cashflows achieve a lower valuation in today’s money.\"\n\n\"If interest rates fall, the reverse is true, you would expect longer term assets like infrastructure to do well.\"\n\nYear-to-date shares are up 18% and Moyes says this \"performance has been driven by the market’s view on the likely direction of interest rates and inflation\".\n\nHe says that the company should pay a dividend of $1.62 in 2024.\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\n\"If BIPC can achieve 6% to 9% dividend growth on top of a 3.9% yield, not guaranteed, it should be a welcome addition to a well-diversified portfolio,\" he adds.\n\nProperty is also a sector that is sensitive to interest rate changes.\n\nAlex Watts, fund analyst at Interactive Investor, says: “As well as potential capital appreciation, income is a key attribute of property investing. Even during periods of market stress, the income return of property has historically comprised a stable and significant portion of the total return.\"\n\nThe TR Property (TRY.L) investment trust is well-suited to access yields from real estate, Watts says.\n\nThe trust invests in real estate investment trusts (REITs), as well as shares and securities of property companies and property-related businesses. It also holds direct investments in UK property.\n\nSector exposure in the trust ranges from French and German offices, to student housing and supermarkets.\n\nWatts says that the trust's manager Marcus Phayre-Mudge, who has run the TR Property investment trust for over 19 years, \"looks for strong management teams overseeing quality assets and healthy balance sheets\".\n\nThe trust has a yield of 4.5% and Watts says it \"has an impressive record of growing the distributions year-on-year\".\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nFor more cautious investors, Hargreaves Lansdown's Cook suggests looking at multi-asset funds, which have a combination of different types of investments.\n\nOne example is the Baillie Gifford Sustainable Income (0P0001JSUH.L) fund which not only has exposure to infrastructure and property, but also to bonds, shares and cash.\n\n\"It’s managed by a number of experienced individuals at Baillie Gifford and the diversified nature of the fund means that even if rate cuts have differing impacts on different regions and asset classes, the fund has potential to benefit from them,\" says Cook.\n\nThe fund has returned nearly 10% on a one-year basis, slightly below its sector average of 13%, though it has a yield of nearly 4%.\n\nHigh-growth companies\n\nScottish Mortgage (SMT.L) investment trust, also run by Baillie Gifford, is another suggestion from the Wealth Club's Moyes.\n\n\"It’s struggled more recently as high interest rates mean many of these high growth companies have struggled to raise money to fuel their growth, leading many to tightening their belts — and their growth expectations — in the process,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Moyes says falling rates could provide a number of tailwinds.\n\n\"Lower rates should make it easier for these companies to raise money, fuelling future growth, while lower discount rates applied to those future growth prospects mean the present value of these companies should increase, [but that's] not guaranteed,\" he adds.\n\nHoldings include chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), as well as pharmaceuticals firm Moderna (MRNA) and Facebook-owner Meta (META).\n\nRead more: BP and L&G shares favourite among Fidelity investors as tech appetite fades\n\nOver one-year, the trust has produced a return of 21%, versus a return of nearly 20% from the FTSE All World index tracker.\n\nMeanwhile, Cook also says that there is value to be found in smaller companies \"who may find it more difficult to attract investment or borrow money in a higher rate environment [but] have tended to perform very strongly during rate cutting cycles in the past too\".\n\nHe says that this part of the UK market is trading on a \"significant discount\" to larger companies.\n\nCook highlights the FTF Martin Currie UK Mid Cap (0P00017MZL.L) as a good option in this space.\n\n\"Richard Bullas has managed the fund since 2013 and is a UK smaller companies’ expert that we hold in high regard,\" he says.\n\nStocks held in the fund include Pets at Home (PETS.L) and housebuilder Bellway (BWY.L).\n\nThe Franklin Templeton (FLXI.L) fund has generated a return of 17% over one year, which is slightly below its benchmark of the FTSE 250 (^FTMC) ex-investment trusts index, which is up nearly 20%, though it's ahead of its peer group average return of 17%.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

The cut is expected to boost discretionary spending by the companies.\n\nThe rate cut will be a welcome move, as semiconductor companies have invested heavily in Big Tech (including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) spending on their artificial intelligence ambitions, which entail substantial capital expenditures.\n\nAlso Read: Super Micro Poised for Expansion as Gross Margin Concerns Ease, Internal Control Risks Priced In: Analyst\n\nThe semiconductor companies are also under pressure due to the U.S. sanctions on China, a crucial market.

        "title": "Analyst Explains NVIDIA’s (NVDA) Competitive Advantage Over AMD",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically “tread water,” gaining less than “one half of one percent.”\n\n“Most of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don’t want to be giving up on the growth,” Stovall said.\n\nStovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors’ radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Trending AI Stock to Watch in September?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNew Street Research recently said in a note that AI infrastructure demand has no slowdown in sight and gave bullish comments about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm believes Nvidia’s key advantage over its competitors like AMD is the full-stack and system-scale integration abilities of its GPUs. These allow for greater chip-to-chip bandwidth interconnect across a larger domain.\n\nComparing NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) with AMD, New Street Research analyst  Pierre Ferragu said:\n\n“It nevertheless doesn’t disqualify AMD, whose architecture is less versatile, less scalable, but can still be competitive, but on a much more limited set of use-cases, and at the cost of dedicated optimization efforts.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports that were confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Huang said that the infrastructure players like his firm and all the cloud service providers put the AI infrastructure in the cloud so that developers could use the machines to train and fine-tune their AI models. He noted that for every dollar a cloud service provider spent with NVIDIA, it translated to $5 worth of rentals.\n\nHuang also stressed that the days of every line of code being written by software engineers were completely over. He instead forecast a future where every NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) employee - the firm presently has around 32,000 employees - would be supplemented by 100x more digital engineers.

The CTO of the company, Kevin Scott, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, remarking that it was super important for the business world to bring down the cost of compute associated with AI development. Scott underlined how one of the things that had supported all of the previous platform revolutions – personal computing, internet, smartphone, and cloud – had been the ability to move from silicon to networks to the low-level software layers that empowered the layers running on top of them to get exponentially cheaper over time. He noted that this was happening with AI, as evidenced by GPT-4 getting 12 times cheaper per token to do inference in May than at launch time.\n\nScott, who was an intern at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) before rising all the way to the top, noted that AI infrastructure had catalyzed a lot of similarities to big tech revolutions of the past. He detailed that because AI was a platform revolution, it was not narrow, where some company had a secret stash of infrastructure that only they had, but instead there was a huge community of people being inspired in a bunch of different ways by what the AI infrastructure was going to allow them to do. Scott said that trillion-dollar companies that are brand new were getting created due to these developments.\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2024, held earlier this month, brought several significant updates on the technology sector for investors, particularly focusing on innovation and financial growth across growth industries. Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\n\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, noting how his company had been way ahead of the others in building AI infrastructure over the past decade. Kurian underlined that these investments were now starting to bear fruit. For example, he revealed that 90% of AI unicorns run on cloud services offered by Google for training and inference. 60% of all AI funded start-ups ever use AI infrastructure developed by Google for training or inference.\n\nKurian, who was at software firm Oracle before joining Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), added that traditional companies were also now building both high-performance and generative AI models on the Google Cloud. Kurian gave the example of carmaker Ford Motor Company, detailing that Ford was using the deep learning technology of Google to build simulations for wind tunnel and for virtual wind tunnel simulation, replacing a traditional approach called computational fluid dynamics.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here: 2 Incredibly Innovative Growth Stocks Down 14% and 59% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Technological innovation has been one of the biggest catalysts for stock market growth over the last century, and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. For investors who back the right companies and allow growth trends and competitive wins to stack up over the long term, incredible returns are possible.\n\nWith that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that buying these two stocks right now while they're still down significantly from previous highs looks like a good move.\n\nNvidia stock is a buy after taking a breather\n\nKeith Noonan: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the company responsible for the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) that are at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It's also the market's most influential and intensely monitored battleground stock.\n\nEven after a 14% pullback from an all-time high reached in June, the company's stock is still up roughly 136% in 2024. Spurred by incredible demand from large data center customers, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms, Nvidia's sales and earnings growth has been nothing short of incredible. But some investors also wonder how long the company can sustain its stellar sales momentum and margins.\n\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $2.86 trillion as of this writing, Nvidia's valuation has soared more than 2,480% over the last five years, and it stands as the world's third-most valuable company. There should be little doubt that it's a high-risk stock, but I also think that it's still one worth owning for long-term investors.\n\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia posted a gross margin of 75.1% -- down from the record margin of 78.4% it posted in Q1. The company also guided for a gross margin of roughly 74.5% in the current quarter. The company is still posting fantastic margins, but it's not unreasonable to think that the business's gross margin may have hit a peak for now. On the other hand, Nvidia's outlook remains very promising.\n\nAfter growing sales 122% year over year in Q2, Nvidia expects Q3 sales to jump 79% compared to 2023's Q3. It also has a major performance catalyst on track to begin contributing in Q4 and then be an even bigger performance driver in the next fiscal year.\n\nNvidia will launch its next-generation Blackwell chips in this year's final quarter, and the hardware is poised to deliver major AI performance improvements and huge revenue for Nvidia. CEO Jensen Huang has said he expects the Blackwell processors to be the company's most successful products ever.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia could price its Blackwell processors at levels that significantly boost gross margins, it doesn't necessarily have to go that route. The company is crushing the competition in the market for advanced GPUs and accelerators for AI, and a relatively small sacrifice on the margin front could help it secure advantages that shore up its long-term positioning in today's most important tech trend.\n\nFor long-term investors looking for ways to play AI trends, Nvidia stock remains a worthwhile portfolio addition.\n\nThe dip in Cognex's share price is an ideal buying opportunity\n\nLee Samaha: There's no way to sugarcoat the situation; machine vision company Cognex's (NASDAQ: CGNX) end markets are struggling in 2024. Still, much of that struggle is already reflected in the share price (down 60% from its all-time high). But long-term investors aren't buying stocks for a few quarters' earnings but rather for their long-run earnings potential.\n\nCognex and its machine vision solutions continue to have substantial growth opportunities. Using automated machine vision in manufacturing or logistics (such as e-commerce fulfillment) helps improve quality, consistency, efficiency, costs, and safety. It also creates digital information used in data analytics to improve processes.\n\nManagement sees its end markets growing at 13% annually for the next several years, with Cognex slightly outgrowing its markets by 15% annually.\n\nOver the near term, Cognex is dealing with a lowering of growth expectations in two of its three key end markets: automotive and consumer electronics. Raised interest rates over the past few years dampened expectations for automotive sales this year, including electric vehicles (EVs), and Cognex's technology is utilized in EV battery production. Relatively high interest rates also challenged consumer discretionary spending (for example, on smartphones, where Cognex's machine vision helps layer screens).\n\nThe result is a dampening of growth prospects in 2024. Given that the company tends to report larger orders in the spring and summer (as its customers gear up for rising production in the fourth quarter), it's unlikely that Cognex will have overly positive newsflow on orders before the spring of 2025.\n\nStill, these trends won't last forever, and a lower interest rate environment in 2025 could spur a release of pent-up investment spending in automotive and consumer electronics. Meanwhile, Cognex's logistics end market is already in recovery mode. That suggests that the weakness in the share price offers an ideal buying opportunity for a company with an excellent track record of growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Yesterday's News: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Poised to Skyrocket Up to 1,050%, According to Select Wall Street Pundits",
        "content": "For much of the last two years, no trend has captivated the attention of investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe potential for AI-backed software and systems to learn over time without human intervention gives this technology the ability to improve productivity and alter consumer/enterprise consumption habits in most sectors and industries. It's why the researchers at PwC expect the global addressable market for AI to reach $15.7 trillion by the turn of the decade.\n\nThus far, semiconductor behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the undisputed beneficiary of the rise of AI. But according to select Wall Street pundits, two other artificial intelligence stocks offer truly eye-popping upside -- up to 1,050%! Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSorry, Nvidia, but you're yesterday's news\n\nBetween the start of 2023 and shortly after Nvidia completed its historic 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024, its valuation soared from $360 billion to a peak of $3.46 trillion. Although it wasn't the first $3 trillion company, we've never witnessed a market-leading business tack on $3 trillion in value in less than 18 months.\n\nNvidia's expansion has truly been textbook. The company's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) rapidly became the preferred choice in enterprise data centers focused on running generative AI solutions and training large language models (LLMs). Based on estimates from the analysts at TechInsights, Nvidia has accounted for 98% of the GPUs shipped to data centers in back-to-back years. Plus, with its prized H100 backlogged, it'll likely maintain a near-monopoly like market share in 2024.\n\nExceptional demand and otherworldly pricing power for Nvidia's AI-GPUs has been assisted by the all-important CUDA software platform. CUDA is the toolkit used by developers to build LLMs and get the most out of their Nvidia hardware. Think of CUDA as the hook that usually keeps clients loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nBut all periods of euphoria eventually come to an end on Wall Street, and Nvidia may very well be yesterday's news.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages Nvidia possesses is its pricing power. With demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia's chips have often commanded a 100% to 300% price premium to rival hardware. But this could soon change.\n\nA number of rival companies, including Advanced Micro Devices, are ramping up production of their considerably cheaper AI-GPUs which are, for the moment, in supply. Businesses wanting to gain first-mover advantages may be strongly incented to use these rival chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs as either complements or eventual replacements to the AI-GPU hardware they've ordered from Nvidia. The writing certainly appears to be on the wall that access to AI-accelerated data center \"real estate\" will be harder to come by in 2025 and onward.\n\nAs new chips become available and Nvidia's larger customers supplement their needs with internally developed AI-GPUs, Nvidia is very likely to see its pricing power and gross margin fade. In short, Nvidia's best days are likely in the rearview mirror.\n\nBut based on the forecast of select Wall Street pundits, this isn't the case for two other potentially high-growth AI stocks. The Model 3 is Tesla's top-selling sedan. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla: Implied upside of 1,050%\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could blow investor's socks off, in terms of upside, is electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). The CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Ark Invest, Cathie Wood, has pegged Tesla's stock as heading to $2,600 per share by 2029. Based on its share price at the time of this writing, this would translate into eventual upside of a cool 1,050%!\n\nThe primary thesis behind Ark's Monte Carlo analysis is that autonomous ride-hailing (i.e., robotaxis) will drive much of Tesla's growth. Ark's expected case is for Tesla to generate $1.2 trillion in sales by 2029, 63% of which would originate from its robotaxi operations. What's more, 86% of the $440 billion in forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), would come from autonomous ride-hailing services.\n\nAlthough Tesla is North America's leading EV manufacturer, and the company has done something no other automaker had achieved for over a half-century -- build a new car company from scratch to mass-production -- there are a multitude of reasons to believe Wood's price target on the company won't come anywhere close to reality.\n\nThe glaring flaw in Wood's Monte Carlo analysis is that it assumes rapid adoption of Tesla's robotaxi. However, Tesla has precisely zero autonomous robotaxis on public roads today, and hasn't surpassed Level 2 full self-driving autonomy for years.\n\nBy comparison, Mercedes-Benz began selling vehicles with Level 3 autonomous self-driving technology in California and Nevada late last year, and has been developing hands-free Level 4 autonomous driving systems. Tesla has rapidly lost its lead when it comes to autonomous driving capabilities and is highly unlikely to achieve the sales and EBITDA targets Cathie Wood has laid out.\n\nTo make matters worse, Tesla is losing its grip in the EV space with competition coming out of the woodwork. After kicking off a price war last year that saw Tesla slash the price of its EV models on more than a half-dozen occasions, its operating margin has, predictability, plummeted. The kick in the pants is that these price cuts haven't halted a rise in global EV inventory for the company.\n\nLast but not least, a progressively larger percentage of the company's pre-tax income can be traced to regulatory tax credits sold to other automakers and interest income on its cash position. These are unsustainable sources of income and not what you'd expect from a market leader.\n\nSuffice it to say, I don't believe Tesla is the \"next Nvidia.\"\n\nMobileye Global: Implied upside of 216%\n\nThe other AI stock with tantalizing upside that could make Nvidia yesterday's news is advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies company Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY). Noticing the next-gen vehicle/EV trend yet?\n\nEvercore ISI global automotive and mobility analyst Chris McNally believes Mobileye stock can jump to $35 per share. Though this is below its record-closing high, it would represent a jaw-dropping 216% increase from where shares are trading at the time of this writing.\n\nThe optimism surrounding Mobileye has to do with the ongoing addition of technology and driver safety features with each new generation of vehicles -- especially electric vehicles. The company's lineup of EyeQ chips is being leaned on to power SuperVision, an end-to-end ADAS system enabled by 11 cameras and autonomous vehicle maps that learn over time.\n\nWhile there's plenty of excitement surrounding this technology, the EV industry is running into challenges that typically plague early stage innovations. The lack of available EV infrastructure, among other factors, has weakened global EV sales in recent quarters and led to reduced demand for Mobileye's solutions.\n\nMobileye Global also pointed to a key customer outside of China delaying the launch of its ADAS system, as well as new tariffs in Europe and the U.S., as added reasons it's had to temper its sales guidance of late. The company's full-year sales guide of $1.64 billion at the midpoint is well below the peak of $1.96 billion that had once been expected in 2024.\n\nIf there's a silver lining for Mobileye Global, it's that the company closed out the second quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and had no debt on its balance sheet. Even with lumpy near-term orders, Mobileye possesses exceptional financial flexibility.\n\nThough it could take some time for ADAS technology demand to mature, Mobileye's solutions look well-positioned for eventual success.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Reflecting On Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks’ Q2 Earnings: Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)",
        "content": "Reflecting On Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks’ Q2 Earnings: Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q2 behind us, let’s have a look at Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate cut and future ones (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin.\n\nBob Bruggeworth, president and chief executive officer of Qorvo, said, “During the June quarter, we fully integrated Anokiwave into Qorvo, adding silicon beam-forming ICs and IF-RF conversion products. We are investing in technology leadership to broaden our market exposure and drive growth, and we are executing on cost and productivity initiatives to structurally enhance our gross margin.” Qorvo Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 16.3% since reporting and currently trades at $100.\n\nIs now the time to buy Qorvo? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. Although it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 7.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $116.49.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $124.1 million, down 34.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 3.1% since the results and currently trades at $53.20.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nHaving been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\n\nQualcomm reported revenues of $9.39 billion, up 11.1% year on year. This result topped analysts’ expectations by 1.9%. Overall, it was a strong quarter as it also logged a decent beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and strong sales guidance for the next quarter.\n\nThe stock is down 4.6% since reporting and currently trades at $172.44.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Qualcomm here, it’s free.\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nFounded in 1969 by a group of former Fairchild semiconductor executives led by Jerry Sanders, Advanced Micro Devices or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the leading designers of computer processors and graphics chips used in PCs and data centers.\n\nAMD reported revenues of $5.84 billion, up 8.9% year on year. This print surpassed analysts’ expectations by 2%. It was a strong quarter as it also recorded a significant improvement in its gross margin. Looking ahead, revenue guidance for next quarter was also above expectations.\n\nThe stock is up 10.1% since reporting and currently trades at $152.40.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on AMD here, it’s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s ‘Doing Better Than Ever’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Stock Picks You Can’t Ignore.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's top stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed the current divide between tech stocks and other sectors, highlighting their tendency to move in opposite directions. For example, on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 228 points and the S&P 500 went up by 0.13%, the NASDAQ, which is heavily influenced by tech stocks, dropped by 0.52%. Cramer thinks it's because there isn’t enough new money flowing into the market.\n\n\"How did we get to this bizarre dichotomy between tech stocks and pretty much everything else, where the two groups now almost always seem to move in opposite directions? Take today: the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 228 points, the S&P advanced 0.13%, but the NASDAQ—with all that tech in it—dropped a bomb. Yes, it fell 0.52%. How could there be such a schism?\"\n\nAs a result, large institutions need to move their investments between sectors since they can’t invest in both at once. This shift is due to market mechanics rather than fundamental news. When stocks are already doing well, it’s difficult to attract new investment, especially when safer options provide attractive returns. Therefore, either tech stocks or other sectors will perform well, but not both simultaneously.\n\n\"It’s because there’s not enough money coming in from the sidelines, so these big institutions have to swap out of one group if they want to buy stock in another. Yet this action has nothing to do with fundamentals; it’s not about the news, it’s about pure market mechanics. When stocks are already red hot, it’s hard to attract new capital from the sidelines, especially when you can get a cozy 4% return for doing nothing. So, either tech wins or everything else wins, but there’s not enough cash for both of them to win at the same time.\"\n\nMarket Shake-Up: Clear Winners and Losers Amid Fed's Critical Rate Decision\n\nCramer notes that this situation results in distinct winners and losers, rather than a range of performance on a positive day. This is occurring amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in their upcoming meeting. Cramer also notes that, despite his usual reluctance to speculate on the Fed’s decisions, recent market movements have been swayed by expectations of rate cuts. For example, when The Wall Street Journal indicated the Fed might choose a 50 basis point reduction, there was a notable shift towards cyclical stocks, particularly those related to housing. This shift, along with other positive news, contributed to the market's best week of the year.\n\n\"What happens? We get winners and losers—not big winners and smaller winners, as you would normally expect on an up day like today. This is all against the backdrop of the big question: will the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points or 50 when it meets on Wednesday?\n\nNow, you know me, I try to refrain from this parlor game of guessing the Fed's next move based on the strength of the economy. Last week, when *The Wall Street Journal* indicated the Fed may actually be leaning toward 50 basis points, we saw this great migration into cyclicals, especially anything related to housing. Of course, last week, there was just enough good news to propel the entire market, which is why it was the best week of the year.\n\nThis leads me to this newfound great divide between tech and non-tech, because that’s how this market seems to be trading. It’s a big reason why I’m out here in Silicon Valley this week. Today, we saw a market that doesn’t believe in AI, or tech in general for that matter. It’s a market that believes a 50-basis-point rate cut will shift money from semiconductors to housing and anything housing-related, and people want to get ahead of that.\"\n\nJim Cramer's Definition of ABT: \"Anything But Tech\"\n\nJim Cramer noted that Monday’s market saw a wide range of winners. Healthcare stocks, retailers, and consumer packaged goods companies all did well, and even oil stocks, which have been lagging, are rebounding. This is unusual because typically when cyclical stocks rise, sectors like healthcare and consumer products would drop. Cramer explains this trend as part of a broader market shift he calls \"ABT,\" or \"anything but tech.\" Essentially, today's market is focusing on sectors outside of technology.\n\n\"Today, the winners broadened out. The healthcare stocks got jiggy, retailers worked, and consumer packaged goods companies outperformed. Even the much-maligned oils are rallying. It’s crazy—healthcare and consumer products should be selling off when cyclicals rally, but that’s not what’s happening because it’s *ABT*. No, I’m not talking about the symbol for Abbott Labs. ABT means “anything but tech,” and that’s what today’s market was about.\n\nThe implications are pretty stark, folks. Market commentators call this a rotation, but that understates what’s really happening here because the move is so vicious and devoid of realism. The market’s action is dictating what we do. For example, we know that the principal beneficiaries of rate cuts are the housing stocks, which rallied again today. This is the second day these stocks jumped as rates continue to plummet. But today, day two, was zero-sum.\"\n\nTech stocks also experienced notable gains because of key events. For example, Larry Ellison from Oracle reported strong earnings and emphasized the need for many additional data centers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Mad Money episode, where he discussed various stocks. We have selected the ten most notable companies he mentioned and ranked them based on their ownership levels by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer noted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock has been struggling since its last earnings report, even though the company is performing well. He pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like other tech stocks, is currently contributing to market losses.\n\n\"And yes, Nvidia—that stock is still struggling since its last earnings report. Nvidia is doing better than ever, but it doesn’t matter. Nvidia, like the rest of tech, is just a share donor to the rest of the market.\"\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a strong investment choice due to its dominant position in the AI and GPU markets. In fiscal Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported an extraordinary 111% increase in revenue and a 137% rise in EPS compared to the previous year, far surpassing expectations.\n\nThis growth is driven by high demand for AI chips like the H100, key partnerships with major tech companies such as\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:META) and OpenAI, and continued investments in AI infrastructure. Analysts are optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future, predicting a 33% potential price increase thanks to its strong market position and growth potential.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia was the number one trending stock in pre-market trading after the artificial intelligence (AI) darling announced a strategic collaboration with Salesforce (CRM) aimed at advancing AI innovation, particularly in the enterprise space, with a focus on autonomous agents and interactive avatar experiences.\n\nThe partnership will combine Nvidia’s AI technology with Salesforce's platform and its Agentforce initiative, targeting improvements in sales, service, marketing, and IT workflows.\n\nThe collaboration seeks to optimise predictive and generative AI workflows, accelerate data processing, and enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering businesses new insights and increased productivity.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Europe rises after Federal Reserve cuts interest rates\n\nMarc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce, said: \"Together with Nvidia, we're leading the third wave of the AI revolution — moving beyond copilots to intelligent agents working seamlessly to drive customer success. This collaboration will allow every Trailblazer to fully harness AI through the Salesforce Platform and Agentforce.\"\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said: \"In the future, every company, every job will be enhanced by a wide range of AI agents.\n\n\"Nvidia and Salesforce are combining our technologies to accelerate the development of AI agents that will supercharge productivity across industries.\"\n\nNext (NXT.L)\n\nHigh street retailer Next has once again raised its full-year profit outlook, driven by robust overseas sales and a recent recovery in UK trading. The group announced a 7.1% increase in underlying pre-tax profits, reaching £452m ($599m) for the six months ending July 27, as overall group sales rose by 8%.\n\nNext’s shares surged 5.5% to a new all-time high of £109.10.\n\nWhile UK sales showed modest growth of 1%, the company's flagship Next brand experienced a slight dip, with full-price sales down 0.9%. The decline was attributed to weaker demand for seasonal collections, as an unseasonably cool early summer affected consumer behaviour. However, overseas markets delivered strong results, with sales surging by 23%.\n\nNext also reported a stronger-than-expected rebound in UK trading in August, as warmer weather helped lift consumer demand. Full-price sales for the first six weeks of the second half increased by 6.9%, reinforcing the company’s optimism.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe retailer has raised its full-year profit forecast by £15m to £995m, and now expects overall sales to rise by 4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “In all, the warm share price reaction to the numbers comes as little surprise and adds to a gain of 46% over the last year, as compared to a rise of 7.8% for the wider FTSE 100 (^FTSE) and of 78% over the last two years.\n\n“Even at these levels the company is not stretched on a historic valuation basis, with the only downside being that such share price recognition has not been echoed by a market consensus which has not moved from being a hold for some considerable time. Even so, Next continues to defy any lingering doubts and the strength of its trading performance should rightly grab the headlines from the naysayers who continue to search for chinks in the armour.”\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nOcado Retail has raised its revenue outlook for the year, now expecting double-digit percentage growth, following a significant rise in third-quarter turnover. The London-listed online grocer reported a 15.5% increase in revenue year-on-year, reaching £658m for the quarter ending 1 September. Weekly average orders also climbed 14.7% to 437,000.\n\nDespite a slight decline in average selling prices, down 0.4%, Ocado benefited from a growing customer base. The retailer saw 1.06 million customers over the period, up from 961,000 in the same quarter last year. This rise comes in contrast to the broader UK grocery sector, where inflation hovered around 2% during the period.\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nOcado has managed to maintain a broadly flat average basket value of £120.97.\n\nHannah Gibson, chief executive of Ocado Retail, credited the company's strategy for its recent success. \"Our focus remains on providing unbeatable choice, unrivalled service, and reassuring value,\" Gibson said. \"We’re seeing this momentum as more customers shop with us more frequently, enjoying better service and value.”\n\nThe upbeat performance and customer growth have bolstered Ocado's confidence in its full-year revenue guidance.\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nShares in Alibaba were trending in Hong Kong after it announced that is making over 100 large language models available to the open-source community as it pushed further into artificial intelligence.\n\nThe models, part of Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen 2.5 series, cover a range of modalities including language, audio, and vision, and are positioned as the company’s most ambitious open-source initiative to date.\n\nJingren Zhou, chief technology officer of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, described the move as a \"significant milestone\" in the tech giant's AI strategy. The announcement was made during Alibaba Cloud's annual three-day event in Hangzhou, China, which featured AI experts and start-up founders, including Chinese-American computer scientist Li Feifei.\n\nRead more: Bank of England bond sales could cost government almost £100bn by 2028\n\nSince launching its Qwen models in April 2023, Alibaba reported over 40 million downloads across leading open-source platforms such as Hugging Face and ModelScope.\n\nAlibaba on Thursday also introduced a new text-to-video model as part of its Tongyi Wanxiang image generation suite, signalling its entry into the fast-growing text-to-video AI market. This move positions the Chinese tech firm in direct competition with global leaders like OpenAI, which is also exploring advancements in this emerging technology.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion.

Latest reports indicate that Sakana AI, an AI startup backed by NVIDIA, has raised more than $210 million in a Series A funding round. The startup had aimed to raise $100 million in funding. The latest round of funding values the startup at more than $1.5 billion, just a year after it first launched. The NVIDIA-backed firm has become popular since it developed a way to automate the integration of multiple foundational models, including large language models, or LLMs, and discovered a way to use LLMs to train LLMs more efficiently.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) might be allowed to export advanced AI chips to Saudi Arabia as the government of the Middle Eastern country aims to train powerful AI models using these chips. The US government might consider easing export rules around these chips which have been put in place over the past few years in a bid to limit the transfer of sensitive technology to Chinese and Russian entities.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company recently launched the latest models of the iPhone with AI features as it seeks to capitalize on growing AI interest in the smartphone business. However, with pre-orders for the new phones down from last year and Chinese firms offering the new models at a discount due to soft demand, it seems like Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that come preloaded on the new iPhones, have not been enough to revive the slowing demand for the Apple phones. Apple Intelligence will be available on new devices in English later this year, with support for other languages coming next year.\n\nDemand for new Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) phones have slowed in China amid increased competition in the Chinese market, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. Apple is competing with Chinese firms like Huawei for phone supremacy. Last week, Huawei unveiled a Z-shaped trifold phone Mate XT just a few hours after Apple launched the iPhone 16 models. The phone shipments for the former have soared 41% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024, as those for the latter dipped by about two percentage points in the same period.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

(NASDAQ:SMCI) develops and manufactures high performance server and storage solutions based on modular and open architecture. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently started coverage of the stock with a Neutral rating and a price target of $450. In an investor note, the analyst underlined that the artificial intelligence server market was growing at a 54% compound annual rate, but increased competition was hitting margins, and the stocks of companies that had diverse portfolios stood to benefit more, especially if margins compressed even further, if server architectures were slow to adopt liquid-cooling in favor of cheaper air-cooled servers and as GPU supply improved.\n\nThe analyst further added that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) faced stiff competition from Dell in the AI server market. Rakesh noted that while AI was a secular driver, diversification across PC/storage generated synergies and value longer term for Dell, even though SMCI had led the market with a 70-80% share with a head start from tight GPU supply, it was now losing share with Dell quickly gaining by leveraging relationships as the server leader.\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 6th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

The stock has rallied in the past few days after investment advisory Jefferies named the firm the top pick in the power sector and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith noted that Vistra had many ways to win following years of acquisitions, rationalizations, and lessons learned about risk that had positioned it well for the power markets of the present.

The company recently announced earnings results for the third fiscal quarter, and Wall Street analysts were quick to outline their views on the report. Benchmark noted in an investor note that the earnings report of Broadcom was being looked to as some sort of savior of the AI momentum trade following a week of incredibly poor performance in the stock price of NVIDIA and most AI related names. However, the advisory underlined that Broadcom delivered only a tepid beat for the July quarter and provided guidance that was just shy of the consensus estimates.\n\nPer Benchmark, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered an earnings report that was solid, without any material soft points, and its AI business lacked the clear upside momentum the Street was looking for. However, the advisory recommended investors take advantage of the near-term share price volatility with Broadcom remaining a key vehicle for participation in the industry's AI adoption.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Top Industry in the World in 2024\n\nA technician inspecting a microchip with advanced technology used in the semiconductor industry.\n\nArm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nArm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers. The stock has climbed in the past few days after a torrid few weeks due to concerns around accounting malpractices. Raymond James recently started coverage of the British company with an Outperform rating and a $160 price target. Analysts at the investment advisory noted that Arm, as the dominant supplier of energy-efficient processor/subsystems IP, was well-positioned to benefit from rapid growth of generative Al in the cloud and at the edge. The analysts expect content increases in mobile along with higher penetration of Arm architecture in auto, data center and PC markets to drive sustainable double-digit growth for the next several years.\n\nAccording to experts at Raymond James, Edge AI was a key catalyst for Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) and for ARMv9, which offered about 2x royalties over prior generation and had a long runway. The analysts added that there was a good possibility that Arm would eventually offer data center Al accelerator IP, which could significantly expand its serviceable addressable market. Competition from RISC-V — an open-source instruction set architecture — was increasing but was unlikely to threaten Arm's dominance, according to the analysts.\n\nOverall ARM ranks 10th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ARM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, despite concerns, the advisory still believed the overall fundamental trajectory at Micron was strong enough to stay Equal Weight rated.\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) recently announced the availability of a new solid-state drive that offers two times faster performance than the previous model.

Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 156\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. JPMorgan recently noted that the strong sales data for August released by the chipmaker suggests that TSM will surpass third quarter guidance numbers. In an investor note, the advisory maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of NT$1,200. Analysts at JPMorgan, led by Gokul Hariharan, underlined that September revenues for the firm were likely to remain flattish or grow slightly month-over-month, helped by the ramp for iPhone processors and continued strength in N3/N5 demand. Earlier this week, TSM released sales numbers for August, reporting 33% year-over-year growth in sales.\n\nPer the analysts, the third quarter revenues of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) could slightly exceed the high-end of the guidance range, due to strong N3 (the 3nm process technology) demand, continued demand for N5 from AI accelerators and other High-Performance Computing, or HPC, products. The analysts expect the fourth quarter to see a healthy 10% quarter-over-quarter growth as well, helped by continued iPhone processor demand and new Android SoC launches from Qualcomm and Mediatek helping to steer further upside in N3.\n\nOverall TSM ranks 12th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In the second quarter earnings call, Rob Mionis, the CEO of Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS), noted that there was strong demand for the Hardware Platform Solutions marketed by the firm, comprising storage, compute, and networking products. This healthy demand, likely to increase in the coming months as hyperscalers invest in AI data centers, had helped the firm post a more than 50% year-to-year increase in connectivity revenues in the second quarter.\n\nStifel recently upgraded Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) to Buy from Hold. In an investor note, the analysts from the advisory noted that the firm could achieve the FY25 EPS estimate of $4 despite an expected decline in server sales due to a technology transition at a top customer. The analysts added that the expected decline would be more than offset by growth in the communications segment of the firm, with the expected 800-G switch investment cycle. In the note, Stifel underlined that the selloff concerns were primarily due to worries of slowing AI investments from hyperscale customers after the earnings reports of key suppliers.\n\nOverall CLS ranks 13th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

        "title": "Has Nvidia Stock Peaked? These Words From the CEO May Suggest What's Next",
        "content": "Over the last two years, the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) have become a bellwether for the technology industry. Among a long list of AI investment opportunities, semiconductor companies have emerged as some of the most lucrative.\n\nSince ChatGPT took the world by storm in November 2022, shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have gained a jaw-dropping 760% as of this writing. In fact, the company's market cap briefly eclipsed $3 trillion.\n\nIt really wasn't too long ago that Nvidia was seen as a niche opportunity among a broader sea of technology companies. And yet, today, Nvidia is the third-largest in the world as measured by market cap, making it more valuable than Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWith AI looking like the next generational opportunity for investors, Nvidia may appear the most lucrative choice of all, given its influential role and seemingly unstoppable potential. However, a recent remark from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has me questioning just how much longer the stock can soar.\n\nWhat did Jensen Huang just say?\n\nLast week, investment bank Goldman Sachs hosted the Communacopia + Technology Conference, where analysts were granted rare access to Huang to ask questions related to Nvidia's product roadmap, customer use cases, and broader industry trends.\n\nConsidering Nvidia has consistently blown out Wall Street's expectations over the last couple of years, you'd think most questions presented to Huang would focus on the prospects of more record growth. But one analyst actually took a different approach: The analyst asked Huang what he's worried about despite Nvidia's market-leading position and strong secular tailwinds fueling its business.\n\nHere was Huang's response:\n\nWell, our company works with every AI company in the world today. We're working with every single data center in the world today. I don't know one data center, one cloud service provider, one computer maker we're not working with. And so what comes with that is ... [an] enormous responsibility and we have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us and demand is so great that delivery of our components and our technology and our infrastructure and software is really emotional for people, because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness. And so we probably have more emotional customers today than -- and deservedly so. And if we could fulfill everybody's needs, then the emotion would go away but it's very emotional. It's really tense. We've got a lot of responsibility on our shoulder and we're trying to do the best we can.\n\nStory continues\n\nI know that's a jam-packed, run-on sentence. And candidly, there are a lot of themes in there that suggest Nvidia is in a good spot.\n\nBut the explanation above doesn't inspire the same sense of confidence in me that it might for other investors. Instead, it makes me a little nervous.\n\nWhy does this make me nervous?\n\nNvidia's roster of chipsets, called graphics processing units (GPUs), includes its highly touted A100, H100, and new Blackwell series. As it stands today, some industry research suggests Nvidia holds 88% of the AI chip market.\n\nHuang really wasn't exaggerating when he said, \"Everybody is counting on us.\" Considering the release of the Blackwell chips was recently delayed due to a design flaw, Huang's remarks about customers being emotional make a lot of sense.\n\nIt's these ideas that have me concerned. Nvidia is no longer just viewed as another semiconductor stock. Rather, the company itself is largely seen as a barometer for the health of the overall AI market. Given this change in perception and the pressure to deliver that comes with it, I'm beginning to think Nvidia's stock price action is increasingly vulnerable.\n\nSaid another way, even if Nvidia delivers a strong quarter of growth, investor expectations are becoming so sky-high that good may not be good enough. When you layer on top just how much influence Nvidia has in the chip space, it's natural to think it's only a matter of time before even the slightest hiccup could take a material toll on the share price. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHas Nvidia stock peaked?\n\nI cannot say with any justifiable certainty whether Nvidia stock is headed higher or not. What I do believe with strong conviction is that shares of Nvidia are unlikely to rise by another 700%. Even in the long run, I think such a move is doubtful.\n\nThere are already several reasons to be wary of Nvidia's long-term growth prospects. At the moment, nearly half of the company's revenue is concentrated in just four customers. Yet, many of these customers are spending significant sums to make their own chips and migrate away from Nvidia.\n\nThe combination of rising competition, decelerating revenue and margin trends, and the immense (and unrealistic) expectations that Nvidia will continue to deliver top-tier products and business results in perpetuity brings me to the opinion that Nvidia stock may have peaked.\n\nWhile further gains are probably in store, I think these will be short-lived. Ultimately, I think Nvidia stock will normalize sooner than many are anticipating. For that reason, investors should consider all pieces of the puzzle before pouring into the semiconductor darling going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The company recently provided a preliminary outlook for the first quarter of 2025 that forecast 5% revenue growth, below market expectations of 9% growth. The outlook spooked investors, but Wall Street analysts have sought to ease these concerns. For example, Bank of America analyst Tal Liani noted that a rebound in the premium part of the smartphone market, along with AI PCs, and better terms for upcoming licensing negotiations should work in the favor of the chipmaker in the coming months.\n\nLatest reports reveal that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is exploring the possibility of buying the chip design business of Intel in a bid to improve the AI product line. One of the favored investments of the mobile chipmaker includes the design operations at the client PC design division of Intel.

        "content": "What has Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Done Since Nvidia Earnings?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock lost 4% in the last 30 days. Last month saw volatility as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its quarterly print and more.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), representing the semiconductor industry, have lost ~7% in the last 30 days. Now, let’s run down the events for Taiwan Semiconductor since Nvidia released its quarterly print.\n\nOn August 28, Nvidia reported second-quarter topline growth of 122% to $30.04 billion, quashing the analyst consensus of $28.68 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Intel Looks To Restructure Foundry Business, Bags Major US Deal and Government Grants\n\nThe company projected third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion—$33.15 billion, versus the consensus of $31.77 billion.\n\nStill, the stock dropped by 6% in after-hours trading, sending semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), down as the print failed to impress the Street.\n\nThe semiconductor sector selloff continued in September, with U.S.-China geopolitical tensions intensifying due to the Western counterpart’s artificial intelligence technology embargo on the Asian counterpart.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor remained invested in solidifying its moat by localizing neon gas production, a key chipmaking material disrupted by the Ukraine war, and fast-tracking the development of silicon photonics to address the energy and data transmission speeds needed by AI computing.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor projected a 50% growth in AI accelerators at the Semicon Taiwan industry forum in Taipei despite concerns over the sustainability of the AI frenzy, which is sending jitters across the market. Broadcom Inc’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly print and guidance did little to contain the semiconductor selloff.\n\nOn the brighter side, reports indicated that the contract chipmaker’s production yield at the Arizona facility is at par with its Taiwan facilities.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor reported 33% topline growth in August 2024, testimony to the smartphone market recovery and continued demand for Nvidia AI chips. Analysts expect third-quarter revenue growth of 37%.\n\nSome of Taiwan Semiconductors key September wins included a Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google smartphone deal involving Pixel 10 and Pixel 11 chips and Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) A16 chip at its Arizona Fab.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is up over 90% in the last 12 months as it led the global foundry market, commanding a 62% share in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock closed at $167.28 on Wednesday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\n\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of IT experts discussing the latest network security trends over a laptop screen.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 88\n\nDell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells, and supports various comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. The company was recently named among a basket of AI stocks that investment advisory Wedbush expects to benefit as the central bank in the US mulls interest rate cuts. Wedbush analysts recently highlighted that a number of information technology stocks that were tied to artificial intelligence had a chance to move higher with the Federal Reserve widely expected to step in and start cutting interest rates this week.\n\nWedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, named Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) as one of the beneficiaries of the emerging trends, noting that the stage was set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 as the Fed and Powell kicked off their rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remained the path, and tech spending on AI remained a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector.\n\nOverall DELL ranks 17th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. The chipmaker recently retained a Buy rating from Citi Research as analyst Carrie Liu noted that August notebook shipments for the firm had increased 15% month over month. In an investor note, the analyst highlighted that the 15% month-over-month increase was more a reflection of the weak demand recorded in July than a material strengthening of the market, further underlining that notebook demand for the third quarter of calendar year 2024 would show a 4% quarter-over-quarter increase, which was less than the average of 5%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has invested heavily to grab a larger share of the server chip market in the past few years, which is currently dominated by rival Nvidia. The chips made by the latter are highly valued by cloud companies, but the high cost associated with them has forced multiple providers to augment their data centers with the chips of the latter.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 18th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

(NYSE:AI) operates as an enterprise artificial intelligence software company in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and internationally. The stock has nosedived in the past couple of weeks after the company missed analyst expectations on guidance numbers for the second fiscal quarter, even though it beat market expectations on revenue and earnings per share for the first fiscal quarter. The firm revealed that fiscal second-quarter sales were expected to be between $88.6 million and $93.6 million, with the midpoint of $91.1 million below the $91.3 million estimate. The company kept its full-year sales guidance, as it expects revenue to be between $370 million and $395 million, with the midpoint of $382.5 million below the $383.9 million estimate.\n\nC3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) is viewed with bullish sentiments on Wall Street. Wedbush recently lowered the price target on the stock to $30 from $40 and kept an Outperform rating, highlighting that the firm delivered Q1 results featuring top and bottom-line beats, which would be largely overlooked by the ASC 606 adjustment where revenue previously called software would now be called services under new guidance, impacting the company's subscription and services growth going forward.\n\nOverall AI ranks 19th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

The rise in IoT-connected devices and the growing emphasis on processing large volumes of digital data are driving the demand for hyper-scale data centers. These facilities are equipped to support the high-performance needs of modern applications and services.\n\nThe emergence of green data centers represents a positive shift towards sustainability in the industry. Green data centers focus on reducing energy consumption and minimizing environmental impact. As businesses and consumers become more environmentally conscious, the demand for green data centers is expected to increase. This trend aligns with broader efforts to promote sustainability and address climate change.\n\nData security remains a critical concern for data centers, especially those handling sensitive information. According to industry reports, a significant percentage of corporate data centers worry about data security. Ensuring robust security measures is essential for protecting data and maintaining trust with clients and customers. The data center industry is undergoing a period of rapid growth and transformation, driven by technological advancements, increased demand for digital services, and a focus on sustainability.\n\nAs the digital landscape continues to evolve, data centers will play a crucial role in supporting the infrastructure needed for modern technology and services. The market’s growth is fueled by factors such as hyper-scalability, automation, and the adoption of advanced technologies, while challenges like data security and geopolitical uncertainties also shape the industry’s future.\n\nFor investors, the data center sector presents a promising opportunity, with the potential for significant returns as the industry continues to expand. Understanding the dynamics of the data center market, including the key trends and challenges, will be essential for making informed investment decisions and capitalizing on the growth of this critical sector.

        "content": "After a disastrous second quarter earnings report in August that resulted in the worst trading day for the company’s stock in 40 years, Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger finally has some good news for Wall Street.\n\nOn Monday, Gelsinger announced that Intel has entered into an agreement with Amazon Web Services that will see the chipmaker produce custom chips for the cloud computing giant.\n\nThe CEO also said that Intel will transform its Foundry business into a subsidiary company with independent directors. A foundry is a manufacturing facility for semiconductors. The move is meant to create clear separation between Intel’s design and manufacturing businesses, providing Intel’s foundry customers with the peace of mind that its design teams won’t have access to their chips.\n\nThat’s not all. Intel also confirmed that it was awarded $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act. In a release, the company said the deal will “help secure the domestic chip supply chain and collaborate with the [Department of Defense] to help enhance the resilience of US technological systems by advancing secure, cutting-edge solutions.”\n\nIt’s not all positive news for Intel, though. It’s in the midst of a massive restructuring plan, which includes laying off 15% of its workforce. The company also announced on Monday that it’s putting some of its plans to build new facilities in Europe on hold. And while it will complete its advanced packaging hub in Malaysia, Intel says it won’t start up the factory until demand improves.\n\nThen there’s Wall Street. While shares of rivals like Nvidia continue to climb, Intel’s stock has fallen a staggering 57% year to date.\n\n“I wouldn't say they're out of the woods yet,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance. “But I'd say additional funding sources, additional partner announcements, a cleaner structure for outside partners to invest are all the right motions.”\n\nIntel’s foundry business gets a boost\n\nIntel is a rarity among semiconductor giants in that it both designs and assembles its own chips. Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) each work with third-party manufacturers, namely TSMC, the world’s largest advanced chipmaker.\n\nIntel is looking to grab market share for TSMC, and to do that it's making chips for both itself and third-party customers. Before the Amazon (AMZN) news, Microsoft (MSFT) was Intel’s most prominent manufacturing customer. Adding another marquee name, however, helps to further establish Intel’s credibility as a chip builder that can assemble semiconductors based on customers’ needs.\n\nStory continues Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Intel is saying that it will have operating guidelines and independent board members that will be fully transparent,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights, told Yahoo Finance. “And I think if they get the right agreement, the right operating rules … I think they have something here. I really do.”\n\nIntel’s foundry moves will also provide the company with the chance to find outside capital for the business.\n\n“Foundry business will now potentially be better able to access outside sources of funding; providing the struggling business line with capital-raising capabilities and, ideally, allow [Intel] to continue focusing on manufacturing capabilities without offsetting core business performance, striking a balance between [long-term] growth prospects and [short-term] profitability concerns,” Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in an investor note following Intel’s announcements.\n\nBut Intel’s foundry business has reportedly faced setbacks. According to Reuters, Broadcom, which is evaluating Intel’s manufacturing processes, was disappointed with test runs of Intel-built chips. Getting Amazon onboard, however, appears to show that Intel’s manufacturing is working for certain customers.\n\nIntel’s work with the Department of Defense, meanwhile, illustrates that the government considers it a crucial supplier for some of its most critical components. Semiconductor assembly plants, Gelsinger has said, will play as large a role in geopolitics over the next 50 years as oil refineries played in the previous 50 years. And Intel is set up to play an important part in that for the US.\n\nNew chips will test Intel’s market strength\n\nIntel’s foundry business alone won’t determine its future prospects, though. Its AI and data center segment will also need to step up after the company made earlier mistakes in the space for high-powered chips.\n\nAccording to Moorhead, Intel’s Gaudi AI processor hasn’t caught on among hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because it came out after those companies began using or working on their own AI accelerators, giving them little reason to purchase Intel’s offerings. Excavators stand in the early morning on the construction site where chip manufacturer Intel wants to build a chip factory.(Klaus-Dietmar Gabbert/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nIntel does have a new GPU coming in 2025 that could prove to be competitive with Nvidia’s and AMD’s data center chips, but it will need to regain customers’ trust if it’s going to take any market share.\n\nThen there’s Intel’s Client Computing Group, which is responsible for the processors that power desktops and laptops around the world. The segment still generates the largest chunk of the company’s revenue, but is facing stiff competition from rival AMD and Qualcomm’s upstart PC chip business.\n\nTo combat that, the company debuted its Core Ultra 200V line of chips earlier this month. Intel says it packs the kind of performance and battery life customers have been clamoring for, and puts the chips up there with the likes of Apple’s custom processors that have won fans thanks to their own powerful and power-efficient design.\n\nNow Intel just has to make sure the Core Ultra 200V series lives up to expectations when it starts hitting store shelves in new laptops this fall. If it can do that, and continue to sign up customers for its foundry segment, Intel could soon find itself back on the upswing.\n\n“This is a good start,” said Newman. “I think anyone that tells you they've turned the corner … is probably ill-informed. But I would say, if you were looking for a kind of a roadmap or signal, the … Ruben Roydirection off the bottom is palpable.” Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhile everyone is talking about rate cuts, some analysts are questioning whether it was necessary even to start cutting rates at this time. Latest data released on Tuesday showed retail sales in the US rose while Wall Street analysts were expecting to see a decline. Oksana Aronov, JPMorgan Asset Management head of market strategy for alternative fixed income, said while talking to CNBC that rate cuts are not even warranted as she thinks there are no signs of broader weakening except for the labor market.\n\nAronov said cutting rates would “loosen” the financial conditions further. The analyst said that about 14 months ago, everyone was looking at the CPI that was clocking in at 3% and expected the metric to fall to 2%. But even after all these months, CPI year over year is at 2.9%. She said that the Fed should move carefully and the 2% inflation target would be “elusive” because fiscal spending will continue to rise.\n\nAI investors are however looking beyond this debate and already positioning to pile into more growth stocks amid the beginning of the rate-cut cycle.\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 buzzing AI stocks and discussed the latest news around them.\n\nWith each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nDan Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that despite his belief that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is going through a “digestion” phase as investors fear a slowdown in spending and want to see a return on their investments, the chipmaker’s shares and revenue could double.\n\n“I firmly believe in the next several years that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revenues will again be able to double from current levels and the stock will be able to double as well.”\n\nNiles yet again mentioned the Cisco analogy, saying the company saw several years of revenue growth before hitting its peak.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an NVDA stock that is more promising than AI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An ETF that just last month was dubbed the most volatile to ever hit Wall Street has already been upstaged, after the debut of a competing product that adds even more leverage.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Pipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate To Build a Happier City, Design for Density London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nThe T-REX 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (ticker MSTU) began trading Wednesday, promising to provide two times the daily performance of MicroStrategy Inc. shares, or 200% leverage in industry parlance. The fund, issued by REX Shares and Tuttle Capital Management, gives even more leverage on MicroStrategy than the ETF known as MSTX. The latter, from Defiance, launched in mid-August and was deemed the most volatile ETF in the US by Bloomberg Intelligence at the time.\n\nMicroStrategy has been seen as a proxy for Bitcoin because of its holdings of the digital token. It has a 90-day volatility of about 88%, underscoring the sharp swings MSTU holders face. For comparison, Nvidia Corp. has a 90-day volatility of 63% and Microsoft Corp. 20%. The MSTX ETF, meanwhile, in the limited time it’s been trading, has a 20-day volatility of roughly 150%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nMSTU is the latest entry in a booming market for ETFs that use derivatives to offer juiced-up or inverse returns on single companies. REX Shares on Wednesday also launched MSTZ, which provides 200% inverse exposure to MicroStrategy’s daily moves.\n\nThe offerings mark “a milestone” in the arms race for riskier ETF products, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas. “It will instantly be the most volatile product available in the US.”\n\nMatthew Tuttle, chief executive officer of Tuttle Capital, called the new fund a “first-of-its-kind,” and acknowledged that the offerings stand to be “the most volatile ETFs in the US.”\n\nCash Draw\n\nLeveraged single-stock ETFs targeting hot tech stocks such as Nvidia have raked in money this year, with the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) taking in $3.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its assets have grown to $4.6 billion. Meanwhile, the uber-leveraged MicroStrategy fund from Defiance — MSTX — has seen inflows of more than $200 million since its debut.\n\nSylvia Jablonski, chief executive officer of Defiance, said MSTX was “a first mover” and had a successful launch, judging by its asset growth. She also pointed out that the fund this week saw its highest trading day yet. Defiance has filed to raise the leverage on its MicroStrategy fund to 2x from 1.75x.\n\nStory continues\n\nLeveraged single-stock ETFs debuted two years ago, even as US Securities and Exchange Commission officials sounded the alarm on them, particularly for retail investors. While the funds are a way to tap volatility, they can also compound losses. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the products “present particular risk.”\n\n“I have to think 2x MSTR ETFs will be primarily adopted by retail traders looking for leveraged Bitcoin plays,” said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading. “As long as they understand the risks involved and make educated decisions about how long to hold them, it certainly gives them a new option for playing crypto.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Could Hit $200 in 2025",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock's breathtaking rally that began toward the end of 2022 has taken a hiatus of late. More specifically, shares of Nvidia have witnessed some volatility since the beginning of July, and the company's solid fiscal 2025 second-quarter results haven't been enough to inject some life into its fortunes on the stock market.\n\nThe reasons behind Nvidia's recent volatility can be attributed to concerns about a slowdown in its growth, as well as the viability of artificial intelligence (AI) technology following the massive investments made in this space by companies and governments across the globe. However, Nvidia's quarterly results and bullish guidance make it clear that the company's impressive growth is here to stay.\n\nMoreover, a closer look at the consensus stock price target indicates analysts expect Nvidia stock to regain its mojo. Nvidia has a median 12-month price target of $150 as per 63 analysts covering the stock, which would be a 28% jump from current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $200 suggests that Nvidia stock could jump another 71% over the next year.\n\nHere's why this semiconductor company's shares could hit that mark in 2025.\n\nNvidia's dominance in AI chips is going to be the driving force behind the stock\n\nStrategic advisory firm Constellation Research gave Nvidia stock a $200 price target in June this year. The firm points out that the semiconductor bellwether enjoys several advantages that could send its shares to $200 in the coming year and even help it sustain its rally for a longer period.\n\nConstellation says Nvidia has managed to create high barriers to entry in the AI chip market and has a robust product roadmap, while high switching costs mean that customers who are locked into its ecosystem are unlikely to move to a competing offering anytime soon. Because of these reasons, the research firm estimates Nvidia enjoys a technology lead of 24 months over its rivals in the AI graphics card market.\n\nA closer look at Nvidia's recent quarterly results will show that it is indeed the go-to supplier of graphics cards for companies and governments looking to train and deploy AI models. The company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 shot up an impressive 122% year over year to $30 billion. The data center business produced $26.3 billion in revenue during the quarter, a jump of 154% from the same period last year.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that the demand for the company's graphics cards based on the Hopper architecture remains solid, with shipments expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year. That's a testament to Nvidia's outstanding moat in the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market as the company's next-generation Blackwell chips are already sampling with customers and are set to go into full production from the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, customers are still willing to purchase Nvidia's older AI chips even though the new ones are on the way, suggesting that its products are indeed superior to rivals such as AMD and Intel. For instance, Nvidia's Hopper H200 processor reportedly outperforms its AMD rival, MI300X, by more than 40% in AI inference applications. Considering that the H200 reportedly costs less than the MI300X, it is easy to see why Nvidia has been witnessing an improvement in the demand for this chip even though newer chips are on the way.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia is likely to maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market. That's also helping the company maintain healthy pricing power and enjoy fat margins. For example, Nvidia's non-GAAP gross margin increased by 5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis last quarter to 75.1%.\n\nAs a result, the company's adjusted earnings jumped 152% year over year to $0.68 per share, prompting analysts to increase their earnings projections for the current and the next fiscal year. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe stock could exceed $200 in 2025\n\nThe chart above indicates that Nvidia's earnings could hit $4 per share in the next fiscal year (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). However, there is a good chance that its earnings could exceed that mark as analysts could continue to raise their growth expectations because of a potentially big jump in its data center revenue next year.\n\nLet's assume that Nvidia's earnings really do increase to $4 per share. That would be a 41% increase over its projected fiscal 2025 earnings. If the stock maintains its price-to-earnings ratio of 55 at that time, the stock price could jump to $220. It is worth noting that Nvidia is currently trading at a relative discount to its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 72.\n\nMore importantly, this company can justify its valuation through impressive growth because of its robust position in the AI chip market. So, there is a good chance that this AI stock could resume its journey north and go past $200 next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Made a 147% Profit Betting on This AI Stock",
        "content": "It's difficult to make a 147% return in a matter of months, but that's what Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) achieved with a multimillion-dollar investment this year. The investment was one of many AI companies Nvidia decided to back. All were companies that it has worked with in the past, so it presumably knows them quite well. Despite the huge profit, Nvidia appears to be holding on to its fairly recent stock purchases. Investors looking for maximum growth should consider jumping in.\n\nThis AI stock could have 1,000% more upside\n\nLess than a year ago, Nvidia plowed $3.7 million into SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) stock. Shares have risen by 147% since then, but there's reason to believe they could rise another 10 times in value over the long term. But before you invest, there are a few things you need to consider.\n\nAt its core, SoundHound AI is a company focused on bringing AI to everything sound-related. From voice assistants to drive-thru ordering, anytime you chat with a speaker, SoundHound AI wants its technology to be there. With more than a decade in operation, the company has amassed more than 200 patents and an impressive customer list that has continued to grow.\n\nIn 2022, for example, it signed a seven-year contract with Hyundai to power its voice-driven AI capabilities. Drivers will be able to chat with their vehicles not only to send messages, get directions, or toggle the air conditioning but also to check in on maintenance issues and discuss how the vehicle has been performing. It's impressive stuff. Over the next few years, that giant user manual sold with new cars could be replaced with a simple conversation -- one conducted directly between you and the vehicle.\n\nSoundHound AI has signed several vehicle manufacturers as customers. But it's also in other industries, including restaurants and fast-food chains. Applebee's and White Castle, for instance, are piloting the technology to improve order times and reduce overhead costs. This is perhaps one of the most popular ways we will all be interacting with AI technologies in the near future.\n\nDespite its sizable tech portfolio, growing customer base, and sizable end markets -- not to mention Nvidia's backing -- SoundHound's market cap remains just under $2 billion. To rise 1,000% in value, the company would need to reach a valuation of around $20 billion. That's not much of a stretch in the volatile AI industry, which could be one of the largest growth opportunities in a generation.\n\nShares trade at a price of 22 times sales, but over the last two years, revenue has grown by more than 150%. If it can replicate these growth rates, shares would trade between 5 and 6 times 2026 revenue. That's a much more palatable valuation, although it will take some patience and execution to get there.\n\nStory continues SOUN Market Cap Chart\n\nShould you invest in SoundHound?\n\nClearly, SoundHound AI's end markets alone would support a $20 billion valuation. According to management, the voice AI market has a total addressable market size of at least $140 billion. SoundHound AI's unique technology can be used across a variety of industries, and its early head start bodes well for its ability to capture a growing share of an otherwise growing opportunity.\n\nBut there's a reason SoundHound still trades at a paltry $1.7 billion market cap. The company remains unprofitable, meaning it continually needs to seek financing in order to stay solvent. This limits its ability to invest in research and development, which is perhaps its most valuable use of funds long term.\n\nResearch and development spending last year was only around $56 million -- a 30% reduction in its peak spending levels in 2023. Big tech companies, including Apple and Alphabet, are investing billions of dollars in this space. Long-term competition will be intense, and it's not clear whether SoundHound AI has the capital to survive, let alone thrive.\n\nIf you're looking for a speculative growth stock with huge long-term potential, SoundHound AI could be for you. Nvidia's backing is certainly a plus. But volatility should remain high, and the potential downside is sizable as well. This is truly a boom or bust investment option for risk-tolerant investors only.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin Surges Ahead of Fed Rate Cut: 5 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Gain",
        "content": "The crypto market has been struggling to stage a rebound. However, the enthusiasm surrounding rate cuts saw Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, surging above $60,000 for the first time since last month.\n\nSeveral factors have posed headwinds for Bitcoin over the past few months but market experts believe a rate cut will help the cryptocurrency resume its rally. Given this scenario, it would be ideal to adopt the buy-the-dip approach. Four such Bitcoin-centric stocks with upside are Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, CME Group Inc.’s CME, BlackRock, Inc. BLK and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nBitcoin Surges on Rate Cut Hopes\n\nOn Tuesday, Bitcoin was trading at $60,477.98 after hitting an intra-day high of $61,337. The surge came as the Federal Reserve began its two-day FOMC meeting, with expectations high that a rate cut will be announced on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin has been rangebound since April, with even the halving event failing to boost its price. Halving, which typically cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by 50% to limit the total supply to 21 million, generally boosts demand and prices. However, Bitcoin's value dropped notably after the recent halving.\n\nIn early August, a broader market bloodbath saw Bitcoin’s price fall below $55,000. The cryptocurrency has since been trying to rebound.\n\nRate Cut to Boost Crypto-Centric Stocks\n\nSoft August jobs data and a marginal rise in monthly inflation have somewhat dampened hopes of a 50-basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The CME FedWatch tool presently shows a 63% possibility of a 25-basis point cut this week, while a 37% probability of a 50-basis point cut.\n\nBitcoin had a solid 2023 and despite its recent decline, has gained 43% year to date. It hit an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14.\n\nA rate cut is likely to help Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A rate cut of any size bodes well for growth assets like cryptocurrencies as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t provide yields. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors are more inclined to go for assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve greater risk.\n\nFive Crypto-Centric Stocks to Gain\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024.

        "content": "Nvidia, ARM initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBarclays upgraded Victoria's Secret(VSCO) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $25, up from $23. The firm sees a balanced risk versus reward for the shares given new leadership, \"sufficiently low\" second half of 2024 consensus expectations, and a return to the brand's \"core heritage and strengths in intimates.\" BTIG upgraded GE HealthCare(GEHC) to Buy from Neutral with a $100 price target. GE HealthCare enters the second half of 2024 with a lower bar and faces easier compares in the first half of 2024, contends BTIG. Barclays upgraded VF Corp. (VFC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $22, up from $19. The firm believes the stock's risk/reward is attractive at current levels. Guggenheim upgraded Sirius XM(SIRI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $30, up from $29. Core operating trends and free cash flow remain stable, while subscriber trends are set to improve, the firm tells investors. Jefferies upgraded Extra Space Storage(EXR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $204, up from $162. The firm anticipates peer-leading sane-store revenue growth as the company closes the 9% gap between Life Storage and Extra Space rents.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nJefferies downgraded Edwards Lifesciences(EW) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $70, down from $85. The firm sees modest TAVR growth continuing for Edwards. Wolfe Research downgraded ResMed (RMD) to Underperform from Peer Perform with an $180 price target. The firm says this is a risk/reward call triggered by its physician survey work. Truist downgraded Incyte (INCY) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $74, down from $83. The company's efforts to offset the Jakafi patent cliff failed, and its oncology programs are \"encouraging but early\" or in highly a competitive space, the firm tells investors in a research note. BofA downgraded Cencora (COR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $245, down from $275. Industry growth is normalizing, and the competitive dynamics are shifting following years of stable end markets in drug distribution and tailwinds from COVID, the firm tells investors. Barclays downgraded Portland General Electric(POR) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $49, up from $48. The firm sees more limited consensus earnings revision potential and less upside to the shares after factoring in the company's $1.5B of additional capex.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nWilliam Blair initiated coverage of Nvidia (NVDA) with an Outperform rating. Nvidia's data center revenue grew 217% in fiscal 2024 and is expected to grow 132% in fiscal 2025, exceeding $110B in revenue from $15B in fiscal 2023, the firm noted. William Blair initiated coverage of Arm (ARM) with an Outperform rating. Blair believes Arm's royalty/licensing revenue model drives best-in-class profitability. William Blair initiated coverage of Broadcom (AVGO) with an Outperform rating. Broadcom is targeting $12B in AI revenue in FY24 and the firm sees room for continued steady growth into FY25 and FY26 driven by increasing custom chip demand, improved software monetization, recovery in non-AI semi chips and accelerating growth of Ethernet AI network fabrics, the firm tells investors. Needham initiated coverage of Supermicro (SMCI) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm views Supermicro as a first mover in the design of GPU-based compute systems and liquid cooled rack level solutions and \"significant beneficiary\" from growing investment in AI infrastructure. HSBC initiated coverage of KKR (KKR) with a Buy rating and $148 price target. The firm thinks the market \"underappreciates its significant earnings growth prospects.\"\n\nView comments",

        "content": "2024 Redefined Massive Market Cap Swings. One Company Shows Up More Than Any Other In The Wildest Single-Day Stock Changes Ever Seen\n\nThe stock market has been a roller coaster in 2024, with some of the largest single-day swings in market capitalization ever recorded. One company, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), dominated both the biggest gains and losses, making it a focal point of market volatility in a year when artificial intelligence (AI) is driving much of the action.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nLet's breakdown the most dramatic market cap swings in U.S. history, starting with the largest gains.\n\nSome of the biggest single-day stock market gains ever happened in 2024, with Nvidia leading the way. The company's value shot up by hundreds of billions of dollars in just a few hours, thanks to excitement about its AI developments and strategic moves in the tech industry.\n\nTrending: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nHere are the biggest single-day market cap gains in U.S. history:\n\nJuly 31, 2024 – Nvidia: +$327 billion February 22, 2024 – Nvidia: +$277 billion May 23, 2024 – Nvidia: +$218 billion June 11, 2024 – Apple: +$215 billion February 2, 2024 – Meta: +$204 billion April 26, 2024 – Google: +$197 billion February 4, 2022 – Amazon: +$191 billion November 10, 2022 – Apple: +$191 billion May 5, 2023 – Nvidia: +$184 billion May 28, 2024 – Nvidia: +$183 billion\n\nOn July 31, 2024, Nvidia saw a jaw-dropping $327 billion increase in its market capitalization in a single day. This was due in part to positive results from AMD, another semiconductor giant, which left investors bullish, particularly given the increasing focus on artificial intelligence (AI) across the tech sector.\n\nTrending: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nNvidia’s performance didn't stop there; it also recorded gains of $277 billion, $218 billion and $183 billion in February and May of 2024, respectively.\n\nHowever, the same market forces that drove huge gains also resulted in some of the largest losses ever. Nvidia, once again, was at the center of this, facing several days in 2024 when its market cap plummeted by hundreds of billions of dollars. Here are the most significant single-day losses:\n\nSept. 3, 2024 – Nvidia: -$279 billion Feb. 3, 2022 – Meta: -$232 billion April 19, 2024 – Nvidia: -$212 billion June 24, 2024 – Nvidia: -$208 billion April 29, 2022 – Amazon: -$207 billion July 17, 2024 – Nvidia: -$206 billion July 24, 2024 – Nvidia: -$205 billion Aug. 29, 2024 – Nvidia: -$197 billion July 30, 2024 – Nvidia: -$193 billion Aug. 1, 2024 – Nvidia: -$192 billion\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending:Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2024, Nvidia's stock took a $279 billion hit, marking the largest single-day market cap loss ever recorded. Several other days in 2024 saw Nvidia shedding over $200 billion, including on April 19, June 24 and July 17.\n\nAlmost all of these big stock changes are linked to AI’s rising influence in the tech industry. Companies like Nvidia, Apple and Meta are all heavily involved in AI through hardware, software, or infrastructure that supports it.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.

        "title": "These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Have Unheard-Of Dividend Yields of 84% and 77%",
        "content": "High-flying Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered fantastic performance for their investors, but with only a few of the Mag 7 stock paying (small) dividends, they haven't been the best fit for income investors.\n\nETF provider YieldMax has a solution, offering a series of stock-specific ETFs that use options strategies to generate income from some of the market's most popular stocks. And the income is simply incredible, especially when it comes to the Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) versions.\n\nAs of this writing, the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF(NYSEMKT: NVDY) and the YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF(NYSEMKT: TSLY) have dividend yields of 84% and 77%, respectively. That isn't a typo.\n\nHowever, there's no such thing as a safe dividend yield of more than 70%, so it's important to know exactly what you're getting into before investing.\n\nHow these ETFs work\n\nAs their names suggest, YieldMax Option Income Strategy ETFs use options to generate income.\n\nOne key point to keep in mind is that these ETFs don't own any shares of the underlying stock directly. They pool investors' money and buy Treasury securities, which are then used as collateral to create options spreads.\n\nI don't want this to turn into too much of a lesson on options, but there are two general approaches the funds' managers can take. The first, which YieldMax refers to as the \"standard strategy\" involves selling call options on the underlying stock to generate income, as well as simultaneously selling put options. The \"opportunistic strategy\" involves selling an at-the-money call option and buying an out-of-the-money call option to allow investors to retain some of the upside potential if a stock moves higher.\n\nIn a nutshell, these strategies are designed to mainly generate income, with some upside in share price (fund NAV) is the stock performs in a certain way. There are three scenarios, and they are generally the same as if you use covered calls in your portfolio:\n\nThe stock price rises, but slowly, over time. This is the best-case scenario and is the one that will typically result in the ETF's share price rising over time. The call options sold expire worthless, investors get to keep the option premium, and the fund's managers can repeat the process. If the stock declines or is flat, the fund will likely lose value but will outperform simply owning the underlying security. The underlying stock performs very well. In this case, the ETF's gains would be limited by the strike prices of its options positions, and the ETF's share price would underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what this all means. The income these strategies generate can be fantastic, but the share price of both ETFs is likely to gradually decline over time. In fact, over the past year, Nvidia stock is up by 168%, while the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF is up by just 5%. Of course, that 84% yield helped to level the playing field, but it still didn't perform as well as if you had simply bought the stock.\n\nTesla is a different story. The stock declined by 17% over the past year, and the YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF declined by 55%. Even including dividends, the ETF delivered a negative 18% total return over the past year, roughly matching the performance of the underlying stock.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe YieldMax ETFs are best suited for cases where you think a stock will rise gradually, and with fairly low volatility, over time. Nvidia is a case where a stock performed very well and Tesla is a case where a stock performed poorly, and both YieldMax ETFs underperformed the stocks themselves. If you're considering an investment in these, I'd caution you to limit your position size, and to consider turning off automatic dividend reinvestment, since over time the share prices of both ETFs are highly likely to decline in value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tidal Trust II - YieldMaxDA Option Income Strategy ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tidal Trust II - YieldMaxDA Option Income Strategy ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tidal Trust II - YieldMaxDA Option Income Strategy ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Monster Gains? Buy This AI Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has almost single-handedly taken the stock market to new highs this year. Well, that may be an exaggeration, but it sure does feel like it. Investors have clamored to own shares of Nvidia after realizing just how essential the semiconductor supplier is to the infrastructure and growth for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The company offers premier computing solutions for AI and has enjoyed incredible pricing power with its customers.\n\nBut what if I told you another technology giant not only has its own Nvidia-like subsidiary, but it's also the only company with the assets to vertically integrate the entire AI supply chain?\n\nEnter Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nThat's right, the owner of Google Search has the hardware, infrastructure, software, and engineering talent built up over a decade that nobody can match in AI tech today. What's more, the stock actually trades at a reasonable earnings multiple after falling 20% from its all-time high in the past several weeks.\n\nHere's why you should buy Alphabet stock if you missed out on Nvidia's monster gains.\n\nAlphabet: The only vertically-integrated player in AI\n\nNvidia has made the graphics processing unit (GPU) a must-have component in the buildout of AI systems, but GPUs have been around far longer than AI has been in the headlines. Inspired by these computer chips, Alphabet began investing in its own computer chip design 10 years ago. It came out with the first tensor processing unit (TPU) in 2015. The goal of TPUs is to optimize Alphabet's massive computing costs stemming from its Google Search, YouTube, and other consumer internet properties.\n\nThis computing hardware has now advanced rapidly. The sixth generation Trillium that launched this year has a 4.7x increase in compute performance versus the prior TPU generation. That is a lot of cost savings that Alphabet will be able to implement across all its new AI products.\n\nTPUs are like Alphabet's in-house Nvidia operation, the backbone of its AI computing. However, it goes much further than just optimizing chip performance. Alphabet has the Google Cloud unit -- powered by TPUs, of course -- that sells Alphabet's AI capabilities to third parties. Google Cloud hit $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and is growing 29% year over year. There is a long runway for this division as demand for AI grows.\n\nOf course, Alphabet has a data advantage for training AI tools as well. Google Search, YouTube, and other Alphabet properties have billions of users around the world that can be used to train AI models. Alphabet's dataset here is proprietary, which is why OpenAI (the organization behind ChatGPT) may encounter legal trouble from scraping data from YouTube transcripts to train its own AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet has the best AI talent in the world and has been investing in AI researchers since acquiring the DeepMind research lab in 2014. Some competitors may be able to match Alphabet's capabilities on one part of the AI supply chain, such as Amazon with its cloud-computing operation. However, there is no company with the combination of computing tech, cloud infrastructure, data troves, and human talent that can match Alphabet in AI. This is why Alphabet has a head start to win in AI this decade.\n\nLots of growth but at what cost?\n\nThere is clearly growth in demand for AI research and computing capacity. But how will that show up on Alphabet's bottom line and generate more profits for the company? In a conference call this year, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that there was a bigger risk of underinvesting in AI than potentially overinvesting and wasting money. Shareholders hate wasting money, though, which is perhaps why the market has been bearish on Alphabet stock recently.\n\nManagement is planning on spending tens of billions of dollars on capital investments for new AI capabilities across its various internet properties. In order to get a proper return on this invested capital (ROIC), it will need to keep growing revenue across its three main segments: Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud.\n\nLast quarter, Google Search (which also includes other Google properties) grew revenue 14% to $48.5 billion. YouTube advertising grew 13% to $8.7 billion. Google Cloud, we talked about above. So far, so good for Alphabet in the age of AI. However, investors will need to keep a close eye on revenue growth. If Alphabet spends all this money on AI infrastructure and revenue growth slows, profits will likely fall. That's just how the income statement math works.\n\nThe stock looks like a bargain\n\nAfter the stock's recent drawdown, Alphabet now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 23. That is much lower than other tech industry competitors, such as Apple, which has a P/E of 33 while growing more slowly. The broader S&P 500 index trades at a P/E close to 29.\n\nIf you are a believer in Alphabet's AI advantage, the stock looks like a bargain right now. Revenue growth across its cloud, YouTube, and Google Search segments should translate into strong earnings. Meanwhile, management keeps repurchasing stock and just announced a new dividend, which will boost returns for shareholders.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Alphabet stock at current levels. If I wanted to bet on the growth of AI, this is the stock I would buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Trillion-Dollar Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Investors are rarely at a loss for important data releases on Wall Street. Monthly economic reports highlighting jobs data and the prevailing rate of inflation, coupled with roughly six weeks crammed full of earnings reports from thousands of publicly traded companies, have the potential to overwhelm investors and allow key announcements to slide under the radar.\n\nIn mid-August, one of these important announcements may have gone unnoticed.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a concise, under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). In other words, 13Fs clue investors into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have been piquing the interest of Wall Street's top asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe second quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire money managers. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves on Wall Street, billionaire investors were clear sellers of AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and big-time buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nBillionaire money managers gave Nvidia the boot for a third consecutive quarter\n\nSelling shares of Nvidia is nothing new for Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. The latest quarter marked the third straight quarter that more than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors had reduced their stakes in Wall Street's leading AI stock. The seven billionaire sellers in the second quarter include (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nWith shares of Nvidia skyrocketing 715% since the start of 2023, as of he closing bell on Sept. 13, 2024, profit-taking is certainly a viable reason for billionaires to be reducing their stakes in the AI kingpin. But there may be much more to this precipitous selling activity than just simple profit-taking.\n\nFor instance, history has been brutally unkind to next-big-thing innovations and technologies over the last three decades. Although large addressable markets tend to excite investors, no game-changing innovation has escaped an early stage bubble in 30 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption and/or utility of next-big-thing technologies and innovations, which eventually leads to real-world growth forecasts failing to meet otherworldly expectations. The simple fact that most businesses lack a genuine game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investments is a pretty clear warning that an artificial intelligence bubble is likely brewing.\n\nExternal and internal competition are going to be challenging for Nvidia, as well. In addition to rival chipmakers bringing AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) to market, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own. This should result in Nvidia's hardware losing out on valuable data center \"real estate\" in the future.\n\nLast but not least, the company's insiders have been big-time sellers. The last time a member of management or the board purchased shares of their company on the open market was December 2020.\n\nBut while billionaire investors were casting aside shares of Nvidia during the second quarter, they were busy buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first trillion-dollar company and \"Magnificent Seven\" member that billionaires fancied instead of Nvidia in the June-ended quarter is e-commerce goliath Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The five billionaire asset managers who bought shares of Amazon include (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,391,262 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,597,676 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,214,055 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,114,948 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (702,235 shares)\n\nThough Amazon's consumer-facing online marketplace is how most people become familiar with the company, online retail sales account for very little of Amazon's operating cash flow and net income. At the moment, the lion's share of its operating income can be traced to its globally leading cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nSales growth for AWS reaccelerated in the second quarter to 19% from the prior-year period, but has consistently remained in the double digits. With businesses still very early in their cloud-spending cycle, and AWS controlling an estimated 33% of the global cloud infrastructure service market, per Canalys, this operating segment should remain Amazon's cash cow moving forward.\n\nAmazon is also generating plenty of cash flow and double-digit sales growth from its two other ancillary operating segments: advertising services and subscription services. The former is benefiting from the exceptional ad-pricing power that comes with attracting north of 3 billion visits each month.\n\nMeanwhile, subscription services (e.g., Prime) should thrive on the heels of an expansive content library. Amazon has become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football and recently signed an 11-year streaming rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA). When coupled with the value Prime provides to its online marketplace consumers (e.g., free two-day shipping on most items), it's readily apparent that Amazon possess meaningful pricing power with Prime.\n\nBased on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Amazon is far from cheap. But relative to consensus cash flow estimates for 2025 -- cash flow is a better measure of value for Amazon since it aggressively reinvests back into its business -- Amazon is valued well below the cash flow multiples it traded at throughout the 2010s.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other trillion-dollar stock that Form 13Fs show billionaire investors have been favoring over Nvidia is software colossus Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). A total of eight billionaire fund managers purchased shares of Microsoft in the second quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,340,392 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (695,444 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (510,822 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (240,624 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (177,726 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (90,287 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (20,684 shares)\n\nThe primary buzz around Wall Street's second-largest publicly traded company by market cap is its artificial intelligence ties. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has worked with OpenAI to incorporate AI solutions into its Bing search engine and Edge web browser.\n\nAdditionally, Azure is the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. Microsoft is actively incorporating generative AI solutions and large language model capabilities into Azure to accelerate growth and make its platform more useful to enterprise clients. AI is very much at the heart of Microsoft's long-tail growth strategy.\n\nBut as I alluded earlier, there are signs that an early innings AI bubble is brewing. The good news for Microsoft is that it has its legacy segments to lean on.\n\nWhile Windows and Office are no longer the growth stories they were 20 years ago, Windows remains the dominant operating system on computers worldwide. In other words, Microsoft can count on predictable operating cash flow from these legacy segments in pretty much any economic climate.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft is sitting on a mountain of cash. Even after purchasing gaming company Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion last year, it closed out June with $75.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. In fact, Microsoft has generated more than $118 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash affords Microsoft the ability to make acquisitions in order to rapidly expand its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Shocking Move by Elon Musk and Larry Ellison Signals Enormous Growth Ahead for Nvidia (and Should Eliminate Its Shareholders' Biggest Worry)",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years. Thanks to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, its quarterly revenues and profits have been climbing at triple-digit percentage rates year over year. The company also boasts a gross margin of over 70%. The market has responded to these amazing results by bidding the stock up by more than 2,400% over five years.\n\nIn fact, the stock climbed so high that the company engaged in a stock split this spring to bring its price down from more than $1,000 to about $120 -- a move designed to make it easier for retail investors to buy in.\n\nAll of this sounds great, but current shareholders and potential investors remain worried about one thing -- future growth. Competition in the AI chip market is on the rise, and some are concerned that Nvidia's pace of growth will start to taper off as cheaper options become more widely available. But a recent shocking move by Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison actually signals that Nvidia still has enormous growth ahead, and should ease investors' fears. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe GPU's speed and efficiency\n\nFirst, a quick summary of Nvidia's path so far. The company makes graphics processing units (GPUs), a type of chip that processes multiple tasks simultaneously. Originally, GPUs were largely destined for use in the video gaming market, but it became clear that their speed and efficiency made them valuable for a host of other computing uses. As companies over the past few years have turned their attention to AI, which demands precisely the sort of high-speed parallel processing power that GPUs can bring to bear, Nvidia took center stage -- and the rest is history.\n\nToday, companies have some choices when they need high-powered chips to launch an AI program or set up a data center -- other players, from Intel to Advanced Micro Devices, make rival AI chips to power such tasks as the training and inferencing of AI models. Some companies, such as Meta Platforms, are even making some of their own chips to power their AI workloads. This is why investors' biggest worry about Nvidia right now is the growth of competition in the market.\n\nNow, let's consider the recent move made by Musk and Ellison. The two billionaires took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out for dinner and \"begged\" him for more GPUs, according to a report in Fortune. Ellison said he and Musk said to Huang, \"Please take our money.\"\n\nWhy would a pair of powerful CEOs have to beg for GPUs instead of just ordering more? Demand is still surpassing supply even as Nvidia works nonstop to keep up with it. But instead of turning to other suppliers, Ellison and Musk decided to talk with Huang and plead their case.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe early stages of an AI build-out\n\nNow let's consider what this means for Nvidia. First, it shows that the company's revenue growth should continue at a high level -- Ellison, Musk, and others are still in the early stages of their AI build-outs, and everyone hopes to reach the finish line first with a winning AI product or platform. So, demand for AI chips is going strong.\n\nNext, and the most important point here, is that Nvidia doesn't have to worry about the competition yet. Yes, some companies are building their own chips in addition to using Nvidia's -- but demand is so high that at this point, Nvidia can't meet 100% of everyone's needs, and its customers have recognized this and planned ahead. In other instances, less expensive chips may be just fine for certain tasks.\n\nBut, overall, what Ellison and Musk did illustrates exactly how important Nvidia's GPUs are in the AI landscape -- and the fact that major companies would rather beg Huang for more than turn to rival hardware.\n\nThis is excellent news for Nvidia's shareholders today, and considering its strengths in innovation, it's good news for those who plan to hold onto the stock for the long term, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Shares NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)’s New Blackwell Chip Platform Has Begun Full-Scale Production",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Ultimate Stock Picks: 10 Hot Stocks to Consider. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's 10 hot stocks to consider.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the unexpected strength in the market, pointing out that many companies are doing better than Wall Street realizes. He suggests that investors should stop second-guessing these companies every time negative news surfaces. Cramer praises the excellent management and execution by CEOs, which he feels often goes unappreciated.\n\n“Suddenly, all is forgiven, or if not all, then at least most. I’m talking about the incredible resilience in this market, buoyed by a recognition that many companies are simply better than Wall Street gives them credit for. We need to stop turning against them every time there’s a seemingly bad data point. Every day I come to work, I’m dazzled by the resourcefulness of executives who do their best to create value for you, the shareholder. Lots of stocks went up on days like today when the Dow advanced 335 points, the S&P gained 75%, and the NASDAQ jumped 1.0%, all thanks to good management and excellent execution that often goes unnoticed.”\n\nJim Cramer acknowledges that while some CEOs might warrant skepticism, many are truly exceptional and deserve more recognition for their efforts. He criticizes the overemphasis on short-term economic indicators, arguing that great companies stay focused and aren’t thrown off by minor fluctuations.\n\n“Listen, I’m not a pushover. I can hit CEOs with tough questions when needed, some of them deserve skepticism and scorn. But there are also plenty of brilliant, hardworking CEOs with incredible teams, and you ignore their hustle at your own peril. This often gets lost in the shuffle when we’re focused on the parlor game of guessing the Fed’s next move, a quarter point, half a point, quarter, half. You know what I say? Let’s get serious. Terrific companies don’t get caught up in that quarter-half shuffle.”\n\nCramer highlights Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen as an example of strong leadership. Despite facing challenges like opposition to its acquisition of Albertsons and a tough economic climate, McMullen has successfully managed to keep food costs down. Through strategies such as an effective loyalty program and improvements to regional stores, the company has performed well. After a strong earnings report, the stock rose more than 7%, reflecting a successful turnaround.\n\n“CEO Rodney McMullen has managed to keep food costs down and deliver fantastic numbers, all while maintaining an expensive, unionized labor force in a very uncertain commodity environment. How? The company confounded critics by developing a superior loyalty program, regionalizing their stores, and creating some of the best private-label products out there, second only to Costco. Food is still expensive, but cooking at home is far cheaper than dining out. McMullen tells us that consumers are no longer flush with cash, especially his most budget-conscious clientele. He notes, “Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essentials, and as the month progresses, they become more cautious with their spending.”\n\nWow, that’s a tough environment! When I heard this, I thought back to the old company, the one that used to miss its numbers whenever the environment got a little tough. Everybody else remembers the old company too, which is why the stock was just sitting there waiting to be picked up, until this quarter’s report, after which it soared more than 7% in response to the fabulous results. Everyone thought the company would drop the ball, as they used to, but McMullen has finally whipped his supermarket into shape.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast, Cramer points out that the tech industry often suffers from misunderstandings due to its complex nature. He believes that Wall Street analysts frequently fail to appreciate the expertise and potential of tech CEOs who have a deep grasp of their businesses.\n\n“We all need to eat, so it’s not hard to understand the grocery business. But it’s quite different when it comes to tech, where analysts constantly doubt the resolve and expertise of CEOs who simply know more about their businesses than the critics. In tech, the complexity often leads Wall Street to conclusions that have little to do with reality.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer’s Morning Thoughts, where he covered different stocks. We have selected and analyzed the ten most notable companies mentioned, ranking them according to how much they are owned by hedge funds, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer shares that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new Blackwell chip platform has begun full-scale production, as CEO Jensen Huang revealed in an interview with CNBC’s Megan Cassella on Thursday, which took place outside the White House. Huang was there, along with other tech leaders and representatives from power and utility companies, to discuss the future of AI energy infrastructure in the US.\n\n“Club holding Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chip platform is starting “full volume production,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s own Megan Cassella on Thursday outside the White House. Jensen, other tech executives, and leaders of power and utility companies were there for a meeting about the future of AI energy infrastructure in the U.S.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strong investment outlook is based on its leading position in AI and GPU markets, impressive revenue growth, and advancements in parallel computing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s latest earnings report predicts a revenue increase of over 107% year-over-year, potentially reaching around $28.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024. Analysts are optimistic, with firms like Evercore ISI and Wedbush projecting more than 20% upside in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock price.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominant 70-80% share of the AI chip market, along with its growing presence in cloud gaming and data centers, sets it up for continued success. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to achieve a 38% annual growth rate over the next five years, with revenue possibly reaching $108 billion by 2026. This growth is driven by its leadership in AI hardware, a sector anticipated to reach a $300 billion annual market by 2027.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's ultimate stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) A Strong Investment Prospect According to Jim Cramer?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Must-See: Jim Cramer’s 10 Best Stock Picks for Investors Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other Jim Cramer's best stocks for investors.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how the slowing economy might lead the Federal Reserve to ease its policies. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates, but it’s unclear whether the reduction will be 25 or 50 basis points. This decision is crucial as it could significantly impact the market.\n\n“At last, the economy has slowed enough that the Fed can take its foot off the brakes and step on the gas. That’s why we’re starting our game plan in the middle of next week when the Federal Reserve renders its verdict: 25 or 50 basis points. We don’t typically have a lot of drama in this business, but this one counts as a nail-biter because we really don’t know how big the rate cut will be. We just know they’re going to cut.”\n\nCramer pointed out that Friday’s market performance was strong, with the Dow gaining 297 points, the S&P rising by 0.54%, and the Nasdaq increasing by 0.65%. This marked the best two weeks of the year for the S&P and the Nasdaq, suggesting that the market might be anticipating a larger rate cut of 50 basis points. Stocks sensitive to interest rates, particularly in housing, surged in response.\n\n“Today’s rally saw the Dow gaining 297 points, the S&P advancing 0.54%, and the Nasdaq climbing 0.65%, capping off the best two weeks of the year for both the latter two indices. The S&P and the Nasdaq suggest the Fed might actually go for 50. That’s a double rate cut. I know this because the stocks most sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing and housing-related names, soared today.”\n\nCramer also cautioned that if the housing market rally continues, it could lead to a sell-off if only a 25 basis point cut is announced. He pointed out that traders are currently pricing in a higher chance of a 50 basis point cut, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. If the Fed opts for a smaller cut, traders who bought in anticipation of a larger reduction might sell off their stocks, potentially causing market volatility.\n\n“To use a little NFL fantasy football lingo, they soared presumably in anticipation of something huge from Jay Powell and company. All aboard! I still find myself betting on a quarter-point cut, though. It’s not that we don’t need a half-point cut, as the economy is slowing pretty quickly, especially for the lower-income cohort. However, I’ve always believed that the Fed should be measured when it cuts rates at this stage of the business cycle.\n\nThe biggest risk is that inflation might flare up again if you cut too much, and a 50 basis point cut all at once makes that a lot more likely. Plus, a double rate cut signals that something may be very wrong with the economy—something we don’t know about, something lurking. So going for 50 could inspire panic, and there’s simply no reason for the Fed to take that chance when it can simply hit us with a series of thoughtful 25 basis point cuts that neither reignite inflation nor cause panic.”\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer warned that if the housing market rally keeps going, it might lead to a sell-off if the Federal Reserve announces only a 25 basis point rate cut. If the Fed delivers a smaller cut, traders who anticipated a bigger reduction might start selling their stocks, which could lead to increased market volatility.\n\n“Now, if the housing rally continues at this pace, these stocks run the risk of being too hot to handle for a mere 25 basis point cut, and we’ll get a sell-off in response. Keep in mind how the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which tracks interest rate expectations based on the Fed Funds Futures Market, indicates that traders are now pricing in a much higher probability of a double rate cut, currently at 45%. That’s much higher than it was a week ago. These traders could indeed be disappointed if the Fed decides to be more measured. They could be your enemy come Wednesday at 2 p.m. as they dump what they bought incorrectly, and that is what happens. That’s what traders do, they let the stocks go.”\n\nFinally, Jim Cramer believes that this week is critical for the market. He advised that if the market declines after a 25 basis point cut, investors should remember the strong performance of the past week. This week’s gains could be a sign of more positive developments as the Federal Reserve continues to ease its monetary policy.\n\n“When I look at next week, I can only conclude that we’re finally at the moment we’ve all been waiting for. So let me give you the bottom line: if we sell off on a 25 basis point rate cut, remember this phenomenal week, because there will be plenty more like it as the easing process continues and progresses.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) A Strong Investment Prospect According to Jim?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer noted that Wall Street is expected to build on Wednesday’s strong performance, following a midday reversal. On the previous day, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang boosted the market by highlighting high demand for Nvidia’s AI chips and promoting the company’s bright outlook. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a long-standing member of the Investing Club’s portfolio, will be a topic of discussion at the September Monthly Meeting, starting at noon ET.\n\nAt a Goldman Sachs conference, Huang described the demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s upcoming Blackwell chip platform as extremely high, with many eager to be the first to get it. This led to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares rising 8% during the session.\n\n“Wall Street on Thursday is on track to extend Wednesday’s robust gains following an intraday reversal. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ignited the market in the prior session after talking up demand for its AI chips and touting the company’s bright future. We’ll discuss Nvidia, a longtime Club holding, and the rest of our Investing Club portfolio at our September Monthly Meeting, which kicks off at noon ET.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chip platform is “so great, and everybody wants to be first,” Jensen said at a fireside chat at a Goldman Sachs conference Wednesday. Shares soared 8% in that session. Jensen also made a compelling case that the value proposition of AI chips overwhelmingly favors Nvidia, something that really resonated with us at the Club. Jensen’s comments were a real death rattle for Intel, by the way.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a strong investment prospect due to its leadership in AI and GPU markets, rapid revenue growth, and advancements in computing technology. In its latest earnings report, NVIDIA projected over 107% year-over-year revenue growth, potentially reaching $28.6 billion in fiscal Q2 2024. Analysts are bullish on the stock, with firms like Evercore ISI and Wedbush forecasting a potential 20% increase in its price.\n\nNVIDIA’s dominant market share of 70-80% in AI chips, along with its growing footprint in cloud gaming and data centers, positions it for sustained growth. With an expected annual growth rate of 38% over the next five years, the company’s revenue could climb to $108 billion by 2026. This growth is largely driven by its leadership in AI hardware, a market expected to expand to $300 billion annually by 2027. The combination of market dominance and strong future demand makes NVIDIA a highly attractive investment.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's 10 best stocks for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): A Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nAn innovative technician wearing a lab coat manipulating semiconductor chipsets in a modern laboratory.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company is a leader in the AI hardware space, controlling nearly 90% of the market for AI GPUs. However, the AI software capabilities of the firm often go under the radar. NVIDIA has a distinct advantage over competitors like Intel and AMD when it comes to AI software offerings. Some examples of this include the CUDA and AI Enterprise software marketed by the chipmaker. The company charges $4,500 per GPU per year for AI software and tech giants that pay for NVIDIA GPUs also pay for these software features in advance. Within the AI software, the firm also markets the DGX Cloud, a cloud service that allows users to train and deploy AI models over the cloud. This service costs a whopping $37,000 per month.\n\nWall Street analysts have been monitoring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) closely. Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $144. In a recent investor note, analyst Joseph Moore detailed that the advisory expected initial volumes of Blackwell in the October quarter, as the initial product was functional but with somewhat lower yields, and still expected a volume ramp of the next revision of silicon through January - all of which was still within the broad brush strokes of guidance.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.

The stock has found itself a fan in CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market. This platform allows accredited investors to invest in commercial real estate, invest today for a 1% boost.\n\nWhat Happened: Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, has bought Broadcom shares, said Cramer in a post on X on Monday. More than the disclosure about Link's Broadcom buy, what caught the attention of social media users was Cramer's comment about his disposition toward the stock. Broadcom, he said, is \"a stock I like very much....\"\n\nSome social media users poked fun at Cramer by reminding him about the negative psychology he has on stocks. \"It's up $30 (21%) or so in 5 days after a dip and it's near all-time highs, then Jim endorses it...,\" one of his followers said.\n\nBroadcom Living Up To Hype? Broadcom, which was largely flying under the radar once, has now risen to prominence with its artificial intelligence foray. The company is now the 11th most-valued global corporation, boasting a market capitalization of a little over $766 billion. Incidentally, it has the highest market cap among techs outside of the Magnificent Seven, minus Tesla, and TSMC.\n\nThis semiconductor and infrastructure software products manufacturer recently reported third-quarter results that thumped Street estimates, thanks to strong AI revenue and solid performance of its VMware business. The San Jose, California-based company also raised its AI revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Despite the results ticking most boxes, the slightly light fourth-quarter guidance sent the stock tanking a little over 10% immediately after the results.\n\nSince then the stock has come back up, thanks to its nearly 20% rise from its post-earnings low.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nStory continues\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif), who is known for her investments, bought 20 Broadcom call options on June 24, with a strike price of $800 and an expiration date of June 20, 2025. The purchase was made after the company reported its second-quarter results on June 12 and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. The stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 15. The congresswoman’s call options now have a strike price of $80, giving effect to the split.\n\nThe average analysts' price target for Broadcom is $198.66, according to TipRanks, with the 12-month price target pointing to over 21% upside from current levels.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): A Chip Stock Powering The AI Boom",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks Powering AI Boom. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAI has played a pivotal role in driving growth within the semiconductor market, transforming it into one of the most lucrative sectors globally. As AI applications proliferate across industries — from cloud computing and autonomous vehicles to healthcare — demand for advanced semiconductor technologies has surged. NVIDIA, a leader in AI GPUs, reported record revenues exceeding $30 billion in Q2 2024, largely driven by AI-related chip sales. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chipmaker, remarked that AI was the most powerful technology force of the time and was transforming industries across the board.\n\nAI demands massive data processing capabilities, which in turn requires highly specialized semiconductors like GPUs, TPUs, and AI accelerators. Experts highlight that 75% of AI workloads rely on advanced chips designed specifically for machine learning and deep learning tasks. Research firm Gartner predicts that 70% of all new AI applications by 2025 will require hardware accelerators, primarily in data centers and edge computing environments, underscoring the critical role of AI in the semiconductor ecosystem. As AI models become more complex, they require exponentially larger memory and storage solutions.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nAI models like GPT-4 by OpenAI and PaLM by Google have billions of parameters, and memory-intensive High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips are crucial for training and inference. This has led to a significant increase in the production of memory chips, with AI-related demand accounting for a large portion of the $500 billion semiconductor industry​. AI-focused startups and established companies alike are benefiting from this growth. For instance, the AMD acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 was aimed at enhancing AI capabilities, resulting in a major competitive advantage in AI chips.\n\nHowever, the rosy picture has been dented in recent weeks on the back of a major selloff in the tech sector and increased volatility in the semiconductor space. Robert Maire, the chief of Semiconductor Advisors, a prominent financial consulting firm, recently appeared on news platform CNBC to discuss the market volatility in the chip sector, highlighting factors like earnings not being enough to keep stocks at inflated values and the threat of possible Chinese oversupply in trailing edge semiconductors. Maire said that AI has been the only driver of growth in the semi market, leading to a situation where investors got ahead of themselves.\n\nMaire highlighted during his appearance that China was still lagging behind the US and Europe in the leading-edge AI space, as it had been deprived of tools needed to keep pace with change in this market. However, the chip advisor claimed that Chinese firms have caught up in the trailing edge AI space, citing examples of Chinese firms like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation and Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited already exceeding US-based firms like UMC and GlobalFoundries in capability. He cautioned that despite progress, Chinese firms were still not doing enough to challenge US-based leaders in the trailing edge space.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected companies that operate in the semiconductor sector and have exposure to the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): A Chip Stock Powering The AI Boom\n\nA series of cryptocurrency ASIC chips connected together in a vast mining facility.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a visual computing firm. Latest reports reveal that AI startup CoreWeave is considering a share sale ahead of an expected IPO. The startup is based in New Jersey and provides cloud access to AI GPUs for training large language models, inference and high-performance computing applications. Per reports, the startup, backed by companies like NVIDIA, will allow employees to sell shares worth $500 million, putting the valuation of the firm at around $23 billion. Last year, the startup was valued at around $7 billion. In May this year, it was valued at $19 billion.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top sector pick of Bank of America. The advisory has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $165. In a recent investor note, the investment advisor acknowledged that the firm faced several near-term headwinds that could suppress the stock, including fundamental ones like the Blackwell delay and gross margin pressure. However, analysts at Bank of America underlined that these headwinds had created an enhanced buying opportunity with the stock trading within the lowest quartile of valuation in the past five years.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the 35 chip stocks powering the AI boom. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What are share buybacks?",
        "content": "A boom in share buybacks has seen a number of companies using this strategy to return money to investors and boost the value of their stock.\n\nTech company Microsoft (MSFT) has announced a $60bn (£45.4bn) share buyback programme, while also raising its quarterly dividend by 10%.\n\nIt isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" tech company to announce a huge buyback in 2024, with Apple (AAPL) launching a $110bn repurchasing plan and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) also unveiling a $70bn programme. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Facebook-parent Meta (META) have announced $50bn buyback programmes in 2024.\n\nBuybacks have also grown in popularity in the UK, as major London-listed companies such as oil major BP (BP.L) and bank Barclays (BARC.L) have launched their own buyback plans.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nA share repurchase, or share buyback, is when a company rebuys its own shares and returns funds to its investors.\n\nThe issuing company usually acquires its own stock by distributing cash to existing holders, paying the market value per share, in exchange for a portion of the company’s outstanding equity.\n\nRead more: Bank of England bond sales could cost government almost £100bn by 2028\n\nWhen a company repurchases its own shares, this reduces the number of shares held by the public.\n\nCompanies can purchase the stock on the open market or from shareholders directly.\n\nWhy do companies do this?\n\nBuybacks became particularly popular during the Covid pandemic as the economic fallout left companies with mounting debt piles from loans and government bailouts. Repurchasing shares enabled firms to reduce debt, shore up their finances and consolidate ownership.\n\nShare buybacks globally hit a record $1.31tn in 2022, but then dipped back $1.11tn last year, according to Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed that share buybacks were nearing their lowest annual value since 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe aggregate value of share buyback transactions for companies trading on major global exchanges through to 9 September 2024 was nearly $164bn, down 35% on the same period last year. That figure was also even lower than the nearly $179bn in buybacks in the comparable period in 2020.\n\nDespite this slowdown in the amount companies are repurchasing, the strategy is still popular, with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed the number of buybacks is up year-on-year.\n\nRead more: Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\n\nThere were 983 buyback transactions worldwide this year up to 9 September, up from 823 for the same period last year and the highest number since the first nine months of 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to shoring up finances, buybacks also provide a more flexible way of returning money to shareholders as an alternative to dividends. Public companies have a goal of maximising returns for their investors, so if a firm is generating more cash than it needs to fund its operations, buybacks are a good option for excess cash.\n\nShare repurchases also increase the company’s equity value, and help businesses to look more financially attractive to investors.\n\nIf a board feels that its company’s stock is undervalued, buybacks are one way to solve this, and are often seen as an expression of confidence by the company.\n\nNot only do they provide an additional exit route to shareholders when shares are undervalued or are thinly traded, but also prevent unwelcome takeover bids.\n\nHowever, as they are typically financed with debt, it can sometimes strain cash flow.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nAs share repurchases cut the total number of shares outstanding, and the total amount of cash on the firm’s balance sheet, this affects several metrics used by investors to estimate a company’s valuation.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nSome of these metrics include earnings per share (EPS), a measure used by investors, and the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nFewer shares in circulation increases a company’s EPS, and a higher EPS normally means a higher share price.\n\nRecent share repurchases\n\nOutside of the major US tech companies, there have been a number of buyback announcements this year.\n\nBP launched a new buyback of $1.75bn in February, with plans to repurchase at least $14bn in shares over 2024-25.\n\nFellow oil major Shell (SHEL.L) also announced a $3.5bn buyback programme earlier in the year.\n\nBarclays also shared its intention to repurchase a further £750m of its shares in August, as part of plans return at least £10bn in capital to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAnother bank to declare a buyback was HSBC (HSBA.L), which announced a repurchasing programme of up to $3bn in July.\n\nEuropean banks have also jumped on the trend, with Italy's UniCredit (UCG.MI) initiating its €1.7bn (£1.4bn) repurchasing plan on Monday, while Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.SW) also launched a $2bn programme.\n\nMeanwhile, UK supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L) also committed in April to buying back an additional £1bn worth of shares by April 2025.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Elon Musk And Oracle's Larry Ellison 'Begged' Jensen Huang For Nvidia GPUs At A Dinner: 'Please Take Our Money'\n\nLarry Ellison and Elon Musk recently implored Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang for additional GPUs during a dinner at Nobu Palo Alto.\n\nWhat Happened: During a meeting with analysts last week, Ellison, co-founder and CTO of Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), revealed that he and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Musk “begged” Huang for more GPUs.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nEllison humorously recounted, “Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.”\n\nThe dinner’s outcome was positive, according to Ellison, who said, “It went ok. I mean, it worked.” Ellison, whose fortune is estimated at $206 billion, according to Forbes, has a history of anticipating technological shifts and positioning Oracle to benefit from them.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nOracle has maintained a strong relationship with Nvidia, which dominates the artificial intelligence chip market. The company is heavily investing in GPU technology for AI applications, with revenues up 7% to $13.3 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nSimilarly, Tesla relies on Nvidia GPUs to train its neural networks for self-driving technology. Ellison emphasized the importance of being the first to build the most capable neural network, stating, “It’s a big deal.”\n\nTrending:Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million.\n\nWhy It Matters: The global supply of high-performance memory chips is expected to remain constrained throughout 2024, driven by the soaring demand for artificial intelligence technology. Leading memory chip suppliers like SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc. are already facing shortages, with stock for 2025 nearly depleted.\n\nSee Also: The startup behind White Castle's favorite Robot Fry Cook announces a next-generation fast food robot – Here's how to get a share for under $5 today.\n\nIn May, Musk acknowledged and praised Nvidia’s impressive market cap, which had reached $2.55 trillion, making it the third most-valued global corporation.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn June, Musk justified his decision to divert Nvidia chips meant for Tesla to his other ventures, X and xAI, explaining that the existing factory space was already allocated to vehicle, battery, and cell production.\n\nThe demand for Nvidia’s RTX 4090 graphics cards has also surged, leading to a supply crisis exacerbated by U.S. sanctions on advanced chips to China.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.

He also runs SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), and a new AI start-up called xAI.\n\nEllison and Musk need tens of thousands of graphics processors (GPUs) for their data centers in order to bring AI to life, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the best chips in the industry.\n\nAt Oracle's financial analyst meeting on Sept. 12, Ellison told the audience that he and Musk recently went to dinner with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the Nobu restaurant in Palo Alto. The two, who are among the richest people on Earth, found themselves begging Huang for something money simply can't buy at the moment. Here's how it went down. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe arms race for GPUs\n\nOracle currently has 162 data centers either live or under construction, but it believes that number could eventually top 2,000 because the demand for computing power from AI developers is soaring. Some of Oracle's largest data centers feature clusters of more than 32,000 GPUs, but next year the company will offer a cluster of 131,072 GPUs from Nvidia's latest Blackwell lineup.\n\nOracle designed unique RDMA (random direct memory access) networking technology that can move data from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks, and since developers pay for computing power by the minute, this can significantly reduce costs. That's why leading AI start-ups like OpenAI, Cohere, and even Musk's xAI are using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nIn its recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended July 31), the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment generated $2.2 billion in revenue, a whopping 45% jump from the year-ago period. However, it could be growing even faster if not for supply constraints -- in other words, Oracle simply can't get its hands on enough GPUs for its data centers.\n\nNot only is Oracle battling other cloud giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet for GPU allocations from Nvidia, but tech companies like Tesla and Meta Platforms are also soaking up supply to develop AI for their own purposes. Tesla is trying to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online this year to enhance its self-driving software, which requires a substantial amount of computing power.\n\nMeta, on the other hand, used around 16,000 of Nvidia's flagship H100 GPUs to train its Llama 3.1 large language model (LLM), but the company plans to increase its capacity to a mind-boggling 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. That will pave the way for Llama 4, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg says could set the benchmark for the industry in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nEllison and Musk are begging for more GPUs\n\nPlease take our money ... take more of it. You're not taking enough. ... We need you to take more of our money. Please.\n\n-- Ellison's and Musk's comments to Jensen Huang over dinner, according to Ellison.\n\nEllison and Musk were practically begging Huang for more GPUs, but no amount of money in the world can buy the numbers they require right now because Nvidia simply can't keep up with demand. Oracle and Tesla aren't even Nvidia's biggest customers!\n\nOracle spent $6.9 billion on capital expenditures (capex) during fiscal 2024 (ended April 30), and it expects to spend double that in fiscal 2025. Most of the money will go toward buying chips and building data centers. Tesla plans to spend over $10 billion on capex this calendar year on the whole, which will also go toward the 50,000 GPU cluster I mentioned earlier.\n\nThose numbers are modest compared to what other tech giants are spending. Microsoft allocated $55.7 billion to capex during its fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), and it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Amazon's capex spending, on the other hand, could top $60 billion in calendar 2024.\n\nTherefore, it's no surprise that Nvidia generated $26.3 billion in data center revenue during its recent fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), a 154% increase from the year-ago period. Ellison says the wave of AI spending could continue for the next 10 years as companies and nation states battle for tech supremacy when it comes to AI, so Nvidia's data center revenue probably has plenty of growth left in the tank.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on NVIDIA’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA Worth?\n\nThe stock is currently trading at US$117 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 22% compared to our intrinsic value of $95.42. This means that the opportunity to buy NVIDIA at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat kind of growth will NVIDIA generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into NVIDIA, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for NVIDIA (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Investing.com — Analysts at Bank of America (BAC) (BofA) hiked their rating on Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE) (NYSE:HPE) shares to Buy from Neutral and lifted the price target on the stock to $24 from $21.\n\nThe company’s shares rose roughly 4% in Tuesday’s market pre-open.\n\nThe upgrade reflects BofA's positive outlook on the company's potential for significant cost cuts, a cyclical recovery in its core markets, and revenue and cost synergies from its upcoming acquisition of Juniper Networks Inc (NYSE:JNPR).\n\nHPE's acquisition of Juniper Networks for approximately $14 billion in cash is expected to close soon, with CEO Neri at the helm. The move is intended to reduce HPE's dependency on compute solutions and enhance its focus on the higher-margin networking business.\n\nDespite a challenging networking market, BofA anticipates that cost synergies from the deal will exceed $450 million, with 70% expected to be realized by the end of 2026, contributing to a significant increase in consensus earnings per share (EPS).\n\n“We expect additional cost takeouts at core HPE of at least 100bps incrementally, which is also likely conservative,” BofA analysts said in a Tuesday note.\n\nIn its Q3 financial report, HPE showcased AI server revenues of $1.3 billion and a substantial backlog of $3.4 billion. The company also reported an increase in server operating margins quarter over quarter, highlighting a focus on profitability.\n\nBofA expects HPE to benefit from its partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), leveraging AI computing and capitalizing on Juniper’s Mist platform in the networking market.\n\n“With decades of expertise in liquid cooling (CRAY systems) and increased adoption of supercomputing, HPE will be able to command a key position in AI adoption at Enterprise and Sovereign,” analysts continued.\n\nHPE's stock is currently trading at approximately 8x the estimated 2025 consensus EPS, which is at the lower end of its historical range of 6 to 13x. While acknowledging the risks of execution challenges and increased leverage, particularly in a recession scenario, BofA's price objective of $24 is based on a 10 times multiple of the projected 2026 pro-forma EPS of $2.40.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHewlett-Packard Enterprise raised to Buy at BofA on several catalysts; shares up\n\nStellantis working hard to avoid Volkswagen plant-closing scenario, CEO says\n\nInstagram rolls out teen account with privacy, parental controls as scrutiny mounts\n\nView comments",

        "content": "I won't keep you in suspense. The five biggest public companies in the world on Jan. 1, 1999, ranked in order from largest to smallest, were:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): $348 billion market cap General Electric(NYSE: GE): $261 billion market cap Intel(NASDAQ: INTC): $197 billion market cap Walmart(NYSE: WMT): $181 billion market cap ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM): $178 billion market cap\n\nHaving said that, there are a few important things to mention. For one thing, 1999 was the height of the dot-com bubble, and there was quite a bit of movement on the list throughout the year. For example, by the end of 1999, Microsoft had reached a market cap of more than $600 billion. Plus, Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) had catapulted its way into the No. 3 spot, while Intel had fallen off it entirely.\n\nThe 5 biggest companies now\n\nAs you might expect given that 25 years have passed since 1999, the list of the largest public companies in the world has changed considerably. Here's where it stands as of Sep. 7, 2024:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.39 trillion Microsoft: $3.00 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): $2.53 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $1.88 trillion Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.78 trillion\n\nMicrosoft is the only company that appears on both lists, and the scale of the players on it has increased by about tenfold. Notably, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total U.S. inflation over that period was only around 92%, so most of that change reflects real growth, not a decline in the value of the dollar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It's no secret that Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock price has surged in recent years thanks largely to its association with artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the massive spending being done to expand data center computing power. Along with the price surge has come a surge in valuation for the stock.\n\nIf you are the type of investor who doesn't like buying hot stocks at hefty valuations but still wants some exposure to the spending jump related to AI and data centers, Johnson Controls(NYSE: JCI) might be the answer. Here's why this heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) specialist offers a great AI-related alternative to high-priced Nvidia.\n\nWall Street upgrades Johnson Controls\n\nJohnson Controls stock received some positive ratings from heavyweight Wall Street investment companies recently. Bank of America analysts upgraded the stock to a buy rating and increased the price target to $80 (from $76), while Morgan Stanley analysts initiated coverage on Johnson Controls with an $85 price target and an overweight rating. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnalysts at both firms mentioned positive indicators involving end-market exposure for Johnson Controls. Bank of America's analyst asserted that Johnson Controls will generate 14% of its revenue from data centers this year. At the same time, Morgan Stanley's analyst said the company's solutions help building owners create efficiency gains -- a good theme as property owners seek to cut costs.\n\nThe AI/data center angle is relevant to the HVAC sector. Robust HVAC solutions are needed to maintain a controlled environment in data centers so equipment can perform optimally.\n\nThat's one reason why HVAC companies' shares have generally outperformed this year. However, Johnson Controls has underperformed its immediate peers, Trane Technologies(NYSE: TT) and Carrier Global(NYSE: CARR). JCI Chart\n\nIt also trades at a valuation discount to its peers. JCI PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nOpportunities for a new CEO\n\nOne reason the stock underperformed the competition was management's patchy record with guidance. Johnson Controls missed its own estimates on earnings in 2022 and sales in 2023. That pattern continued in its fiscal 2024 (which ended Sept. 30, 2024). During its fiscal Q2 earnings call in May, management maintained its guidance for full-year organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, only to cut it to approximately 3% in its Q3 report released on July 31.\n\nIt's unclear if the company's disappointing execution is why activist hedge funds are taking positions in the stock. Still, we know George Oliver announced he would retire as CEO in conjunction with that same third-quarter report. Hopefully, its next leader will be able to take advantage of the company's significant growth opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Johnson Controls can outperform\n\nWhile organic sales growth of 3% isn't what investors expected this year, the company's orders and backlog continue to grow. Oliver noted \"strong demand for our data center solutions,\" and asserted, \"We have built a leading position in data centers in North America, due to a unique and compelling customer value proposition.\" Data source: Johnson Controls. Chart by author.\n\nAlongside the growth in data center demand to support the computing power needs of AI, Johnson Controls has an excellent growth opportunity coming from the trend of retrofitting buildings as owners strive to cut costs and reduce their carbon footprint. These efficiency gains are also being driven by the increasing use of digital technology in buildings, and the company continues to see strong adoption of its OpenBlue digital platform.\n\nRestructuring to focus on its core business\n\nA third catalyst that could lift its stock price comes from the company restructuring to focus on its core commercial and industrial HVAC business, not least by agreeing to sell its residential and light commercial HVAC business to Bosch in a transaction valued at $8.1 billion. (Johnson Controls will receive $6.7 billion.)\n\nAlongside the sale of its air distribution technologies business, Johnson Controls will divest businesses responsible for about 20% of its overall sales, becoming a much more focused company in the process.\n\nA stock to buy\n\nAfter those divestitures, an even larger share of the company's revenue will come from data centers and AI, while the underlying growth from the race to net zero will continue to support order and backlog growth.\n\nJohnson Controls may not be as exciting a stock as Nvidia, but the company looks undervalued given its potential. Investors can expect good returns from the stock if management delivers on the opportunities outlined above.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson Controls International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson Controls International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson Controls International wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Super Micro Computer SMCI, Apple AAPL and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nTime to Buy These Closely-Watched Stocks? NVDA, SMCI, AAPL\n\nTechnology stocks have remained at the forefront of market headlines all year long, with excitement surrounding AI and a resilient economy leading to outsized gains.\n\nAnd over the past few weeks, three tech stocks in particular – Super Micro Computer, Apple and Nvidia – have been the three most popular stocks being searched for on the Zacks website.\n\nGiven their popularity, let’s take a closer look at how each presently stacks up.\n\nNVDA Remains AI Favorite\n\nNVDA shares have been the hottest topic of 2024, widely outperforming on the back of record-breaking quarterly results. The company’s earnings outlook remains bright across the board, with the current $2.80 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 115% year-over-year growth.\n\nConcerning its latest quarterly release, the AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting a 15% sequential jump from Q1 and an even more impressive 122% year-over-year climb. The company’s sales growth has been remarkable, with this period’s results penciling in the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the true focal point of the release, which again delivered in a big way. Data Center sales reached a quarterly record of $26.3 billion, up 16% sequentially from Q1 and 154% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nJensen Huang was unsurprisingly bullish on the Data Center, stating, ‘Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.’\n\nAs shown below, the company’s Data Center results have regularly blown away our consensus estimates as of late, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.4 billion.\n\nApple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro\n\nTech titan Apple recently hosted its Apple Event, which showcased several new models of existing products. A few of the notable features of Apple’s new iPhone 16 Pro include better battery life, AI capabilities (coming in beta later this fall), and the biggest display screen yet.\n\nThe earnings picture is still in great shape for the tech titan, with analysts revising their expectations higher across the board over recent months.\n\nThe company’s iPhone results have been somewhat mixed as of late, delivering both misses and beats over the past year. A slowdown in China iPhone sales has been a thorn in the side of the company, which fell 6.5% year-over-year throughout its latest period.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it’s worth noting that the company’s Services portfolio, which has shown great growth, has eased the blow from the iPhone’s slowing growth considerably. Services revenue of $24.2 billion throughout its latest period reflected a quarterly record, 15% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nThe company’s Services results have consistently exceeded consensus expectations.\n\nIt’s been no secret that the company’s growth has been stalling, but perhaps recent news surrounding its new lineup of products can reverse the trend. Apple is in the very early innings of its AI offerings, a key aspect to keep in mind when sizing up its long-term prospects.\n\nSMCI Faces Fraud Allegations\n\nSMCI shares have been decimated since making their all-time high in mid-March, down more than 60% after an enormous run to begin the year. Shares faced pressure following the release of its recent quarterly results, with a recent short report from Hindenburg Research accusing the company of accounting manipulation not helping the stock either.\n\nThe company is a total IT Solution Provider for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, fully explaining the buzz around the stock in 2024. Like NVDA, the company’s reported sales have shot higher, penciling in triple-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates in each of its last three quarters.\n\nFor those unaware, SMCI has had an interesting history, with the recent short report not the first time the company has been accused of fraud. In 2018, SMCI was temporarily delisted for failing to file financial statements, and by 2020, was charged $17.5 million by the SEC for “widespread accounting violations.”\n\nAnd on August 28th, the company delayed the filing of its 10-K annual report, bringing about further scrutiny. Time will tell what happens concerning the recent short report, but the stock undoubtedly has some questions surrounding it, a critical development that investors should keep close tabs on.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTech stocks continue to be the craze, with their strong quarterly performances and the buzz surrounding AI pushing them higher all throughout 2024.\n\nAnd concerning the ones investors have been most curious about, all three stocks above have been in high demand on Zacks.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Q2 Earnings Review: Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks Led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nWrapping up Q2 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the processors and graphics chips stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was 12.9% below.\n\nStocks, especially growth stocks with cash flows further into the future, had a good end of 2023. On the other hand, this year has seen more volatile stock market swings due to mixed inflation data, and processors and graphics chips stocks have had a rough stretch. On average, share prices are down 7.5% since the latest earnings results.\n\nBest Q2: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 4.5%. Overall, it was an exceptional quarter for the company with a significant improvement in its inventory levels and an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates.\n\n“Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Investor expectations, however, were likely higher than Wall Street’s published projections, leaving some wishing for even better results (analysts’ consensus estimates are those published by big banks and advisory firms, not the investors who make buy and sell decisions). The stock is down 6.7% since reporting and currently trades at $117.28.\n\nRead why we think that Nvidia is one of the best processors and graphics chips stocks, our full report is free.\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO)\n\nFormed by the merger of TriQuint and RF Micro Devices, Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) is a designer and manufacturer of RF chips used in almost all smartphones globally, along with a variety of chips used in networking equipment and infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nQorvo reported revenues of $886.7 million, up 36.2% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 4.1%. The business had a strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts’ EPS estimates and a significant improvement in its operating margin. Qorvo Total Revenue\n\nAlthough it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 15.9% since reporting. It currently trades at $100.46.\n\nIs now the time to buy Qorvo? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it’s free.\n\nWeakest Q2: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $124.1 million, down 34.7% year on year, falling short of analysts’ expectations by 4.7%. It was a disappointing quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group. As expected, the stock is down 6.6% since the results and currently trades at $51.32.\n\nRead our full analysis of Lattice Semiconductor’s results here.\n\nSMART (NASDAQ:SGH)\n\nBased in the US, SMART Global Holdings (NASDAQ:SGH) is a diversified semiconductor company offering memory, digital, and LED products.\n\nSMART reported revenues of $300.6 million, down 12.7% year on year. This number was in line with analysts’ expectations. Aside from that, it was a mixed quarter as it produced a significant improvement in its gross margin but underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter.\n\nThe stock is down 20.1% since reporting and currently trades at $18.56.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on SMART here, it’s free.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nOriginally the semiconductor division of Hewlett Packard, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor conglomerate that spans wireless, networking, data storage, and industrial end markets along with an infrastructure software business focused on mainframes and cybersecurity.\n\nBroadcom reported revenues of $13.07 billion, up 47.3% year on year.

        "title": "Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Colossus Nvidia Plummet 98%?",
        "content": "For the better part of two years, no trend has excited investors more on Wall Street than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe lure of AI is twofold. First, there's the ability for AI-driven software and systems to learn over time without human intervention. The capacity for software and systems to become more proficient at their tasks, or perhaps even learn new jobs/skill sets, gives this technology utility in almost every sector and industry around the globe.\n\nThe other reason investors can't seem to get enough of AI stocks is the eye-popping addressable market attached to this game-changing technology. According to the researchers at PwC, AI is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with these gains coming from a combination of consumption-side benefits and productivity improvements.\n\nWith a seemingly limitless ceiling for AI and an addressable market that dwarfs pretty much every other next-big-thing innovation for three decades, it's not a surprise to see investors flock to AI colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Just be mindful that not everyone on Wall Street expects Nvidia to maintain its lofty valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's ascent has been virtually textbook\n\nWhen 2022 came to a close, Nvidia had a $360 billion market cap and was an important, but not critical, company in the tech sector. Less than 18 months later, it briefly became the largest publicly traded company in the world, with a peak market cap of $3.46 trillion.\n\nNvidia's historic gains are a reflection of the otherworldly demand for its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) used in high-compute data centers. Based on estimates from the analysts at TechInsights, Nvidia has accounted for a roughly 98% share of the GPUs shipped to data centers in 2022 and 2023. In other words, its hardware is being relied on as the undisputed preferred choice for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nIn addition to its hardware being in high demand, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is doing its part to keep enterprises loyal to its ecosystem of products and services. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build LLMs and maximize the computing capacity of their Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThere's also plenty of excitement surrounding future innovation. Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chip, which will be far more energy-efficient than its predecessor, is set for its debut in the coming months. CEO Jensen Huang also teased the release of his company's Rubin GPU architecture in 2026, which will run on a new processor, known as Vera. Investing in innovation makes it likely that Nvidia will maintain its No. 1 spot in terms of AI-GPU computing capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this array of positives, big-time Nvidia bears do exist.\n\nCould Nvidia plunge 98%?\n\nPerhaps no Nvidia skeptic has been more vocal on Wall Street than financial writer and economist Harry Dent.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Digital in June, Dent highlighted that the mammoth increase in money supply has set the U.S. economy and stock market up for disaster. He referred to the current market as the \"bubble of all bubbles,\" with Nvidia expected to be a victim of an upcoming crash. Dent pegged Nvidia's potential decline at 98%. Dent further opined,\n\nThis bubble has been going for 14 years. Instead of most bubbles [going] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.\n\nAs an Nvidia bear myself, I don't expect it to come anywhere close to a 98% downdraft.\n\nAlthough we have witnessed a couple of next-big-thing market leaders eventually plummet by 98%, including Canopy Growth following the hype in cannabis stocks, and 3D Systems, which has lost just shy of 98% of its value after 3D-printing buzz failed to materialize, a 98% peak-to-trough loss for a market leader is rare.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia had other established sales channels in place prior to its AI revenue windfall. It's a leading provider of GPUs used in gaming and cryptocurrency mining, and should enjoy steady gains from its virtualization software segment. While these now-ancillary operations won't offset substantial weakness if the AI bubble were to burst, they'd almost certainly keep Nvidia from losing 98% of its value.\n\nBut even though a 98% decline isn't in the cards, a sizable drop that could extend beyond 75% is quite possible. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDent is right about one thing: History\n\nAlthough Harry Dent's call for a 98% plunge in Nvidia may be out in left field, he did hit the nail right on the head when discussing history. While history doesn't repeat to a \"t\" on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme.\n\nSince the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, every highly touted innovation, technology, and trend has worked its way through an early stage bubble-bursting event. Though the timing of when the music stops will differ in every instance, the end result is always the same -- market leaders getting pummeled.\n\nWithout fail, investors overestimate the utility and uptake of game-changing innovations and technologies. While artificial intelligence appears to have a bright long-term future, the fact that most businesses lack a well-defined game plan to profit in the near-term from their AI investments is a pretty clear indication that investor expectations are vastly outpacing real-world utility. In other words, it points to the formation of an AI bubble.\n\nThe vast majority of market-leading businesses for game-changing innovations over the last 30 years have shed 75% or more of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\n\nThere are other potential concerns, too. For instance, insiders have been selling stock for 45 months without a single insider purchase. Though there are benign reasons for selling stock, such as for tax purposes, there's only one reason to purchase shares on the open market -- you think they'll increase in value. No insider has bought shares of Nvidia on the open market since Chief Financial Office Colette Kress in December 2020.\n\nIt's also logical to expect Nvidia's monopoly like AI-GPU market share to come under pressure in the quarters that lie ahead. The interesting thing is that internal competition might be even more worrisome than the AI-GPUs its rivals are bringing to market.\n\nNvidia's four largest customers by net sales are all internally developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even with Nvidia's chips having superior computing capacity, these four customers will likely be incented to utilize their own hardware over Nvidia's. This is a recipe for fewer orders in the future.\n\nAlthough a 98% decline is highly unlikely for Nvidia, a steep drop still appears very likely.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Morgan Stanley’s Best Stock Picks for 2025",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\n\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\n\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\n\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\n\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\n\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\n\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\n\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\n\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow – requiring “Goldilocks” growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 26%\n\nShare Price Target: $150\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's largest and most advanced graphics processing unit designer. Its GPUs, which offer businesses the ability to accelerate their workloads, are also key to its hypothesis. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s rapid share price growth of 715% since 2023 started is built on Wall Street's optimism of its GPUs being heavily demanded for enterprise computing use cases. Artificial intelligence is also one of these use cases, and as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have lost 12% since their June peak, the firm has sought to slightly shift the narrative. At a recent conference, CEO Jensen Huang shared that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also plays in a non AI $1 trillion market for GPUs that will help accelerate computing that has slowed down over the years due to physical limitations of CPU design. Naturally, this means that as long as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to design superior products and there is demand for them, its shares perform well. However, any inventory glut or growth in custom chips by the likes of Amazon and Meta could spell trouble.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\n\nMoreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Larry Ellison and Elon Musk ‘begged’ Nvidia’s Jensen Huang for more GPUs over a fancy sushi dinner",
        "content": "The secret to getting more of the highly coveted Nvidia graphics processing units essential for advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning might be yellowtail sashimi.\n\nAt a meeting with analysts last week, billionaire Oracle cofounder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison told the audience that he and world’s-richest-man Elon Musk took Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang out to dinner at Nobu Palo Alto and “begged” Huang to give them more GPUs.\n\n“I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs,” Ellison recalled. “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.”\n\nThe outcome was a net positive, said Ellison. “It went ok. I mean, it worked.”\n\nEllison, whose famed fortune is estimated to be $206 billion, is a prominent figure in the tech industry and serves as executive chairman of enterprise software firm Oracle. He is known for anticipating significant technological shifts, including accurately positioning the $475 billion tech giant to reap the benefits of the internet in its early days. He has further solidified the company by shifting it to capitalize on the surging need for cloud-based enterprise infrastructure. The company has maintained a strong relationship with Nvidia, which controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and is the prime choice for companies working on AI.\n\nAt last week’s meeting Ellison said the competitive landscape won’t hinder Oracle’s growth. The simplest way of looking at it, Ellison replied, is the phrase,“the race goes on.” He likened the current competition in AI to a Formula One driving race.\n\n“You’ve got three people on the podium, but there’s really kind of one winner,” said Ellison. “Someone is going to be better at this than anyone else, and multiple people are trying and there is a race.”\n\nFor its part, Oracle is making gargantuan investments in GPU technology, particularly for AI applications. The tech giant this month announced its first quarter results for fiscal 2025 and disclosed revenues were up 7% to $13.3 billion, year-over-year. Profits were $2.9 billion. Oracle also disclosed that it has 162 cloud datacenters in operation or under construction around the world and the largest of its datacenters is 800 megawatts and will house “acres of Nvidia GPU clusters” used to train large-scale AI models. In the first quarter, Oracle signed 42 more cloud GPU contracts, totaling $3 billion.\n\nSimilarly, Tesla, where Musk serves as CEO, relies on Nvidia GPUs to power the supercomputers that train its neural networks for self-driving and assisted driving technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Ellison, being the first to build the most capable neural network in the world “is a big deal.” Given the desire to be at the forefront, many executives in AI are begging Huang for GPUs and building datacenters, he said.\n\n“Does anyone know what it costs to build a frontier model over the next three years?” Ellison was referring to the most advanced, bleeding-edge AI systems.\n\n“One hundred billion,” said Ellison. “That’s going to get you in the game.”\n\n“Not a lot of people and not a lot of companies and not a lot of countries will participate.”\n\nNvidia and Tesla did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) As A Standout Despite Recent Negativity Surrounding Its Performance",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Stocks to Track for Potential Growth. In this article, we will look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks among Jim Cramer's top stocks to track for potential growth.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto their stocks, anticipating a rebound after the market’s downturn. This advice proved useful as the Dow rose by 484 points or 1.16% and the NASDAQ also climbed by 1.16%, indicating that selling during the market decline was not the best choice.\n\n“Last week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday’s downturn wasn’t the best strategy.”\n\nJim Cramer noted that the previous week was tough for economically sensitive and tech stocks, despite a mixed August employment report. This report suggested a balanced economic outlook, not too strong or weak, which initially seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, shifting away from cyclical stocks to more recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, with industries such as industrials and semiconductors being particularly affected.\n\nCramer observed that recession-proof stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, have performed well recently but have seen significant gains, raising concerns about a potential correction.\n\n“Today, recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.”\n\nHe highlighted that historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it signals a shift in investment strategy. With the Fed expected to ease rates soon, Cramer suggests investors consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and look into more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulus. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn is challenging, the anticipated rate cuts could make these stocks more attractive. Cramer advises maintaining diversification but being ready to adjust investment strategies based on the economic outlook.\n\n“Historically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it’s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it’s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it’s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It’s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he talked about several stocks. From there, we picked ten companies and discussed how hedge funds are investing in them. Finally, we rank these companies from those least owned to those most owned by hedge funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer highlights NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a standout despite recent negativity surrounding its performance. After a strong earnings report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell from $126 to $102, with many investors misunderstanding the company’s potential and even mispronouncing its name. This week, those who sold in panic might be regretting their decision.\n\nCramer notes that demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new Blackwell supercomputer chipset is so high that CEO Jensen Huang mentioned customers are becoming “emotional about allocation,” indicating strong demand rather than a shortage. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s use of accelerated computing with its advanced GPUs offers significant energy efficiency and cost advantages compared to traditional CPUs from companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\n“Naturally, saving the best for last: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). We got a huge quarter from them last month, yet all we heard was how disappointing the numbers were. Yeah, cancel the watch parties for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), no more tailgating. The stock was trading around $126 before the quarter and fell to $102 at its lows last week. The world had given up on it, but they didn’t even know why or how. They didn’t even know what NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does. They certainly can’t pronounce it—they say it like Nivea cream.\n\nThis week, those who panicked and dumped the stock. Well, guess what? I think they’re trying to remember why the heck they did something so foolish. We’ve now learned that demand is so strong for Blackwell, the new supercomputer chipset that is shipping in volume this year, that CEO Jensen Huang says customers are getting “emotional about allocation.” That sure doesn’t sound like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s got a demand problem, as many critics speculated at the time.\n\nIt sounds more like they’ve got “too much” demand. Plus, Jensen talked about the other huge part of the business: accelerated computing. No one talks about that, which uses NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s ultra-fast graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle anything intensive, rather than the CPU, which is usually made by Intel. This approach is much more energy-efficient and faster, not to mention cheaper when it comes to energy consumption, which has become the key variable in the total operational cost of semiconductors. Next thing you know, the stock’s at $119. Can it get back to where it was before the so-called horrendous quarter? Can it hit 127 again? I don’t know. All I can say is: why not?\n\nLook, it’s right to be skeptical when you’re investing. It’s right to be cautious. But the bottom line is, not every executive deserves the same level of skepticism or scorn. Some CEOs have earned your trust.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a top investment pick due to its strong position in the AI sector, impressive financial performance, and growing presence in data centers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) leads in AI hardware with its powerful GPUs, like the A100 and H100, which are crucial for AI model training and inference. This leadership has significantly boosted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue.\n\nIn Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) exceeded expectations with revenue reaching $26 billion, a 206% increase from the previous year, and an EPS of $4.02. The demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI chips remains high, with growth expected to continue in data centers and AI applications through 2025 and beyond. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strategy to diversify its data center revenue across different sectors and regions strengthens its growth prospects.\n\nWhile high valuation and potential fluctuations in AI demand are risks, Wall Street’s strong buy ratings and price targets up to $1,200 reflect NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s potential for significant returns, making it an attractive investment in AI and accelerated computing.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.\n\nThe reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on the list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to track for potential growth. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Intel Missed Out on PlayStation 6 Chip Deal to AMD: Report\n\nIn 2022, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) lost out to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), a multiyear Sony Group Corp (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation 6 chip deal, according to a Reuters exclusive report.\n\nThe sources told Reuters that tapping Intel would have posed backward compatibility issues, entailing higher costs and engineering resources, as AMD made the PlayStation 5 chip.\n\nIntel fell out with Sony by failing to quote an appropriate selling price per chip after factoring in its profit share per chip sold to the PlayStation maker, the sources told Reuters.\n\nAlso Read: Google Picks Taiwan Semiconductor For Pixel Chips, Samsung Loses Key Deal: Report\n\nAccording to Reuters, the five-year deal involving contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) could have contributed $30 billion to Intel.\n\nSince its release in 2020, the PlayStation 5 has sold over 59 million units, marking a respite for significant console makers, which faced double-digit percentage declines in May 2024. Sony is eying an upgraded, premium version dubbed PlayStation 5 Pro before the holiday season.\n\nSony’s fiscal first-quarter 2024 topline growth was 2% to $19.3 billion, beating the consensus of $17.19 billion. Game & Network Services (G&NS) revenue increased 12%.\n\nIntel stock has been down over 48% in the last 12 months as it has failed to capitalize on the artificial intelligence shift.\n\nThis has forced it to weigh strategic options for Israeli autonomous driving company Mobileye Global Inc (NASDAQ:MBLY) and its Enterprise Networking division.\n\nThe contract chipmaker bagged two wins in September, including $1.91 billion in Polish state grants for a new chip plant in the country and a $3.5 billion deal to manufacture semiconductors for the U.S. military.\n\nAMD stock is up 49% in the last 12 months as it succeeded in tapping the AI frenzy while maneuvering its position versus Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock closed higher by 6.36% to $20.91 on Monday.

        "content": "Nvidia's AI Surge Powers 25% of S&P 500 Gains in 2024, Makes Co-founder Huang Among Fastest Growing: Report\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally disproportionately influences the S&P 500 index, reflecting concerns over the domino effect due to the integrated semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nNvidia accounted for 25% of the S&P 500’s 17% gain in 2024, Reuters reports.\n\nThe chip designer has risen by 166% in the last 12 months as Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), splurge on their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Gains Ground in AI Chip Market, Oracle Exec Confirms Growing Demand: Report\n\nThe rising valuation of NvidiaNVIDIA in 2024 has helped boost the wealth of Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of the company that was once created inside a Denny’s restaurant.\n\nHuang has a wealth of $90.5 billion, ranking 18th according to Bloomberg. While Huang hasn’t cracked the top 10 list yet and would currently need to hit a wealth of $130 billion, the Nvidia co-founder is one of the fastest risers among the world’s richest people. Huang’s wealth is up $46.4 billion year-to-date in 2024.\n\nThat figure is more than the combined $41.83 billion gained by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Musk, Bezos and Gates currently rank first, second and fifth, respectively, with their current wealth and year-to-date gains.\n\nElon Musk: $237 billion, +$7.73 billion year-to-date Jeff Bezos: $195 billion, +$17.9 billion year-to-date Bill Gates: $157 billion, +$16.2 billion year-to-date\n\nThe gain by Huang is one of the largest year-to-date gains, trailing only Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is up $49.9 billion and listed fourth at $178 billion.\n\nIt’s not just personal wealth – due to the AI frenzy, Huang expects hyper-scale customers to produce $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia’s infrastructure. He also reiterated that Blackwell-based products will ship in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia stock losing value would impact the S&P500 and Huang’s wealth. However, Huang had snubbed geopolitical tensions surrounding supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), voicing the possibility of switching suppliers.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia have a combined weighting of 20% in the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 31%, and Apple has risen 22% in the last 12 months as they remain invested in their AI goals.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia and the S&P 500 through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 1.95% to $116.78 on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s Strong August Sales Hint at Big Gains Ahead, AI and iPhone Demand Fuel Optimism\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) a Good Big Tech Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other big tech stocks.\n\nThe State of Big Tech Right Now\n\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\n\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of  AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\n\nHow Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors?\n\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\n\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\n\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is perhaps the most famous semiconductor company in the market right now. It is based in Santa Clara, California.\n\nWhile the semiconductor sector has historically been highly cyclical, meaning that stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tend to go through boom and bust cycles in line with the economy, this chip maker's recent performance has been such that investors are confident in its ability to weather any storm. Over the past four quarters, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has posted record results, with profit margins expanding to over 60%.\n\nThe driving force behind these results is the fact that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) products are seeing high demand from almost every cloud infrastructure company and AI start-up. Because of this demand, investors believe that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could continue to do well even in a recession. In fact, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is seeing so much demand that it's struggling to meet the needs of those vying for its components - this then has become one of the biggest challenges for the company, with CEO Jensen Huang beginning to feel the pressure to deliver more Nvidia products to a growing number of customers.\n\nIn total, 179 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $53.7 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.\n\nLee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\n“ A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it’s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it’s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative,” Lee said.\n\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings?\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nUBS recently listed Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as one of the top tech stocks to own for the end of 2024.\n\nUBS believes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) GPU roadmap. Its GPU offerings are seen as “competitive” with Nvidia’s (NVDA), due to superior memory bandwidth and a push towards full-system solutions, UBS said.\n\n“We see data center becoming [roughly] 70% of [operating profit] next year and AMD is seeing strong momentum on both GPU and CPU aspects.”\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nBaron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs,9 GPUs, FPGAs,10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.\n\nLee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\n“ A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it’s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it’s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative.\"\n\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nSpeaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said that a trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose data centers will inevitably transition to accelerated computing.\n\n“We’re in a computer revolution,” Huang said, pointing out that the first wave of data center modernization is driven by generative AI, which he described as more than just a tool—it’s a skill.\n\nHuang also emphasized the need for “densification,” with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) aiming to make data centers more efficient by compressing them into smaller spaces. He discussed NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chip system, which is set to begin full production and shipping in Q4, with strong demand from customers eager to adopt it.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s declines after the latest quarterly results were more or less expected amid Blackwell delay reports confirmed by management. However, the delays were mainly due to a change in Blackwell GPU mask. That does not affect the main functional logic or design of the chip, according to analysts. While Blackwell has been delayed for a few months, it does not change the core growth thesis for Nvidia.\n\nNvidia is set to see huge growth on the back of the data center boom amid the AI wave.\n\nAt Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in March 2024, CEO Jensen Huang estimated annual spending on data center infrastructure at about $250 billion. Over the next decade, this could total between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, depending on how long this level of investment continues. During the same Q&A session, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya echoed this estimate, suggesting the total addressable market would fall in the $1-2 trillion range, particularly as countries invest in their own AI infrastructure. By the end of the decade, spending could be at the high end of that range.\n\nOf course, Nvidia won’t dominate the entire $2 trillion opportunity, as it faces competition from companies like AMD and internally developed AI accelerators from Google, Amazon, and even Apple. Some analysts believe Nvidia’s data center market share between 2025 to 2029 will be over $950 billion—less than half of the total market—but still enough to make it the leader in the sector.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Snowflake Stock's 9.47X PS Still Worth it? Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "Snowflake SNOW shares are trading at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Computer & Technology sector. Its forward 12-month Price/Sales of 9.47X is higher than the broader sector’s 6.2X and the Zacks Internet Software Industry’s 2.56X.\r\n\r\nSnowflake’s near-term prospects remain foggy. The stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nSnowflake stock has dropped 42.8% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s gain of 14.5% and the broader sector's return of 19.8%. \r\n\r\nSNOW shares are trading below the 50-day and the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nSNOW Shares Trade Below 50-Day and 200-day SMA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSo, the question that investors should ask is - is Snowflake’s premium valuation justified given the near-term weakness? Let’s dig deep to find out.\n\nPrice/Sales Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSNOW Shares Suffer From Lower 2025 Margin View\n\nSNOW has been suffering from stiff competition from the likes of Databricks, as well as increasing pricing pressure and growing GPU-related costs as it aggressively invests in AI initiatives. This has hurt gross margin prospects, with Snowflake lowering its fiscal 2025 margin guidance. \r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, SNOW expects a non-GAAP product gross margin of 75% (down from previous guidance of 76%) and a non-GAAP operating margin of 3% (down from previous guidance of 6%).\n\nSnowflake Inc. Price and Consensus Snowflake Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSnowflake Inc. price-consensus-chart | Snowflake Inc. Quote\n\nSlowing top-line growth is a concern. Snowflake expects fiscal 2025 product revenues of roughly $3.3 billion, indicating 24% year-over-year growth, much slower than the 38% year-over-year growth it reported in fiscal 2024.\n\nSNOW's YTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSnowflake’s Earnings Estimate Trending Down\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 is currently pegged at 57 cents per share, down by 1.72% over the past 30 days and indicating a 41.84% year-over-year decline. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 is currently pegged at 88 cents per share, down by 9.3% over the past 30 days and indicating a 53.61% year-over-year decline. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $3.53 billion, suggesting 25.74% growth over fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2026, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.32 billion, indicating 22.3% over fiscal 2025.\n\nSNOW’s Expanding Portfolio Aids Long-term Prospects\n\nAlthough Snowflake is a risky bet in the near term, long-term prospects are robust, driven by a strong portfolio and an expanding partner base.\r\n\r\nSNOW has introduced capabilities, including Marketplace Listing Auto-Fulfillment & Monetization, account replication & failover, Query Acceleration Service, geospatial analytics and Snowpipe Streaming. \r\n\r\nIceberg tables, Hybrid tables and Cortex Large Language Model (LLM) and machine learning-powered functions became available in public preview. These capabilities are expected to become generally available in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nSnowflake’s Polaris Catalog — a vendor-neutral, open catalog implementation for Apache Iceberg — the open standard of choice for implementing data lakehouses, data lakes and other modern architectures is supported by Iceberg’s open-source REST protocol.\r\n\r\nPolaris Catalog offers Apache Iceberg interoperability with Amazon’s AMZN cloud division Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Confluent, Dremio, Google Cloud, Microsoft MSFT Azure, Salesforce and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nSNOW’s Strong Partner Base: A Key Catalyst\n\nSNOW is benefiting from an expanding partner base that includes Amazon, Microsoft, NVIDIA NVDA, Fiserv, EY, Deloitte, LTIMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, among others.\r\n\r\nIts collaboration with NVIDIA will help customers and partners build customized AI data applications in its platform powered by NVIDIA AI. \r\n\r\nSnowflake has adopted NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into Snowflake Cortex AI, its fully managed LLM and vector search service. The integration will help enterprises to smoothly connect custom models to diverse business data and deliver highly accurate responses.\r\n\r\nExpanded Snowflake and Microsoft partnership plans to offer an interoperability experience between Snowflake and Microsoft Fabric OneLake. The interoperability is possible due to their support for the industry’s leading open standards for analytical storage formats, Apache Iceberg and Apache Parquet.\r\n\r\nSnowflake also announced Snowflake Data Clean Rooms to customers in AWS East, AWS West and Azure West. SNOW leveraged its acquisition of data clean room technology provider Samooha to launch the solution.\n\nSnowflake Shares – Buy, Sell or Hold?\n\nSnowflake is a risky bet in the near term, given its modest growth prospect and a stretched valuation. However, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding, given its strong portfolio and partner base over the long term.\r\n\r\nSNOW currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "content": "What's Going On With Alibaba Stock On Monday?\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) stock was down Monday as China’s lackluster economic data led to a sell-off, SCMP reports.\n\nThe economy also bears the brunt of the U.S. advanced semiconductor sanctions by restricting its access to sophisticated artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and peers.\n\nHyperscalers like Alibaba and Baidu, Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) need the chips to accomplish their AI ambitions. AI can prove to be a crucial benefactor for its e-commerce, logistics and cloud businesses, something that Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) accomplished.\n\nAlso Read: Alibaba And Tencent Lap Up Meta’s AI Large Language Model\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, steel, aluminum, EV batteries, and critical minerals, effective September 27.\n\nEconomic data showed that Chinese industrial production, retail sales, and fixed-asset investment were disappointing in August. Home prices reported a record low in nine years.\n\nBarclays flagged to SCMP the urgency of stepping up policy easing and boosting domestic demand.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBOC) told SCMP it could slash banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 bps, followed by another half-point cut in the first half of next year.\n\nAlibaba stock is down close to 3% in the last 12 months.\n\nAlibaba Stock Forecast For 2030\n\nPredicting the future in stock prices over long periods of time is challenging.

        "title": "10 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "One way to make money as an investor, and possibly become a millionaire or multimillionaire in the process, is to pay attention to growing trends and expanding technologies -- and to invest in the companies that seem likely to dominate in those areas. Keep in mind, though, that this strategy won't always work out as you might hope, and that it can be safer and also powerful to just stick to low-fee, broad-market index funds. They can make you a millionaire, too.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is growing more prevalent quickly these days, and many investors reasonably wonder where they might invest in order to capitalize on AI. Here are 10 stocks to consider. Each is playing a significant role in the world of AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n10 artificial intelligence stocks that could make you a millionaire\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nMost investors have heard of semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) by now and either own it or wish they did. Originally known for gaming chips, now it's not only a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for games but also in chips for data centers. That bodes well for Nvidia's future, as data centers are booming, with much of our AI activity running through them. Nvidia recently carried a market value topping $2.5 trillion -- and that's after a 24% drop from its 52-week high!\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), parent of Facebook and Instagram, among other platforms, is another player in the AI arena, spending billions on AI research and incorporating AI into many of its offerings. The company has also raised eyebrows by making its Llama AI model open-source.\n\n3. Dell Technologies\n\nYou may not think of hardware specialist Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) as an AI company, but remember that the proliferation of AI has meant the proliferation of servers and storage systems -- which Dell supplies. The company has reported robust growth in its AI-related sales.\n\n4. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is being added to the S&P 500, and for good reason, as it has grown into a specialist in AI software with a recent market value topping $67 billion. It began with a focus on serving governmental customers but has been expanding into the commercial realm.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is a semiconductor specialist offering wireless, optical, and AI processing chips, among other things. Its AI business is doing quite well, as revenue from AI-focused optical and networking chips jumped 280% in the second quarter, hitting $3.1 billion. Some expect it to profit handsomely from custom AI chips, as well.\n\nStory continues\n\n6. Micron Technology\n\nJust as the boom in AI requires lots of servers and data centers, it also requires a lot of memory, which is where memory specialist Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) comes in. Micron is a cyclical stock, so expect it to go up and down along with the economy.\n\n7. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is involved in all kinds of technologies, from its widely used Office productivity software to its Azure cloud computing platform to the Xbox gaming platform and the Windows operating system, among others. Microsoft has also invested billions in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and it has been incorporating AI into many of its offerings.\n\n8. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm is a chipmaker that supplies many chips inside smartphones -- not to mention cars and even household appliances. It's been developing AI-focused chips recently and it's poised to benefit as more AI computing starts being done within devices instead of in the cloud.\n\n9. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet dominates the search world with its Google engine, and it has been incorporating AI into Google successfully -- without having to outsource its AI technology. Better still, unlike many of the other companies in this list, Alphabet's stock seems attractively valued at recent levels, with its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.4 well below its five-year average of 23.6.\n\n10. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is an AI chip maker, and it's getting into the server business, as well, with a recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems.\n\nThese are just 10 of many solid AI-related and AI-focused companies out there.\n\nArtificial intelligence stocks in perspective\n\nYou might be wondering why I listed 10 stocks instead of the best one or two. Well, it's because I don't know which AI-involved stocks will end up dominant in the future. It's easy to guess, and the companies above certainly stand to prosper from AI, but no one really knows how things will play out. Also, these stocks are often not cheap, including many of the ones above.\n\nGiven that, you might consider favoring a fund of AI stocks. Or just a fund focused on technology stocks, as that would invariably have a lot of exposure to AI. That's a good way to avoid missing out on most of tomorrow's big winners. Some possibilities with terrific track records:\n\nETF Expense Ratio 5-Year Avg. Annual Return 10-Year Avg. Annual Return 15-Year Avg. Annual Return VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) 0.35% 31.46% 25.47% 22.33% iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) 0.35% 25.82% 23.25% 20.89% Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) 0.09% 21.91% 19.47% 18.58% Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) 0.10% 21.12% 19.65% 18.82%\n\nData source: Morningstar.com, as of Sept. 6, 2024.\n\nIf you know a lot about AI, you might do well investing in the stocks you think will be the best long-term performers. If not, consider buying a basket of AI companies, either individually or via a fund. You can ride the AI boom to millionaire status choosing any of these routes.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 755% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 165% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 16, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – September 16, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, Apple Inc’s AAPL and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhat AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks with Strong Price Upside\n\nOf late, the stock market has wavered, with tech stocks underperforming in July and August. The euphoria about the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution faded following the post-earnings decline in shares of prominent chipmakers, leaving Wall Street without a major driver.\n\nChip stocks tanked from a mid-July high as their stretched valuations raised doubts about their capability to sustain real revenue growth, which resembles the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nHowever, the AI boom is here to stay and will drive the prices of chip stocks northward. In reality, chip stocks have now begun to gain ground by banking on the strength of AI. Thus, it’s prudent for investors to keep an eye on chip stocks like NVIDIA Corp., Broadcom Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., which display strong price upsides and increase shareholders’ wealth.\n\nAI is Not in a Bubble Like Dot Com\n\nThe foundation of AI is based on practical applications whereas the dot-com companies had business models based on speculative ideas. Moreover, several sectors, including technology, healthcare, transportation, agriculture and finance, are adopting AI, curtailing sector-related bubbles’ risks.\n\nCompanies from these sectors utilize AI for product innovation, efficiency and cost savings. Thus, AI has more tangible economic benefits in contrast to the abstract nature of the dot-com period. Mature infrastructure like cloud computing platforms supports the deployment of AI technologies. However, these established infrastructures were not there for dot-com ventures.\n\nBooming AI to Boost the Stock Price of NVDA, AVGO, TSM\n\nThe global AI industry expanded beyond $184 billion in 2024, a jump of nearly $50 billion from 2023. The astounding growth is estimated to continue till 2030, with AI market size surpassing $826 billion, according to Statista.\n\nNVIDIA will benefit from this growth since the chip giant provides hardware and technologies vital for AI applications. NVIDIA’s graphic processing unit (GPU) is a core part of the computer server infrastructure required to train large language models and function AI interfaces.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom also plays a crucial role in the AI ecosystem. Its products used in data centers are important for AI applications. Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan expects the company’s AI revenues to climb to $12 billion in fiscal 2024 and increase further in fiscal 2025 due to an uptick in demand for custom accelerators for AI data centers. Broadcom’s AI revenues increased 10% sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter to about $3.5 billion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, manufactures chips for companies that make AI hardware and are therefore well-poised to gain from the flourishing AI industry. TSMC’s manufacturing capability is required for GPUs to be functioning. These GPUs are essential for data centers where huge amounts of data are stored. These data are needed for AI applications, whose demand has shot up and, in turn, is expected to boost TSMC’s business.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 71.1%\n\nA possible green light from the U.S. government to export chips to Saudi Arabia, the launch of the much anticipated next-generation Blackwell chip and a wide competitive moat in the GPU market space will surely help the NVIDIA stock to scale northward (read more: 2 Reasons NVIDIA Stock Popped Yesterday With More Room to Run).\n\nBrokers, thus, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 27.7% from the stock’s last closing price of $116.91. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 71.1%.\n\nBroadcom Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 51.6%\n\nBroadcom’s capability to pay off debts banking on strong cash flow should propel its stock price. Broadcom’s free cash flow (FCF) was $4.791 billion in the fiscal third quarter, while revenues came in at $13.07 billion. Thus, the FCF margin was 36.65% (i.e., $4.791 billion/$13.07 billion in revenues), slightly more than last quarter’s 36% (read more: Broadcom Selloff Explained! Should You Buy the Dip in AVGO Stock?).\n\nHence, brokers have increased the average short-term price target of AVGO by 20.3% from the stock’s last closing price of $158.27. The highest price target is $240, an upside of 51.6%.\n\nTSMC Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 46.9%\n\nTSMC’s significant pricing power due to its supremacy in the high-end chip market, and being the exclusive manufacturer of Apple Inc’s  AI chips should help its share prices scale upward (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\n\nTherefore, brokers have raised the average short-term price target of TSM by 20.3% from the stock’s last closing price of $170.23. The highest price target is $250, an upside of 46.9%.\n\nShares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and TSMC have soared 140.6%, 47.4% and 64.8%, respectively, so far this year.\n\nAll these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "BHP Group Sounds Alarm on Copper Supply, AI and EV Growth Could Drive Prices Soaring: Report\n\nMining company BHP Group Ltd (NYSE:BHP) has flagged an acute shortage of copper metal as global Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and more, splurge on their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nThe growth of data centers and AI could boost global copper demand by 3.4 million tonnes a year by 2050, the Financial Times cites BHP’s CFO Vandita Pant.\n\nPant told the FT that BHP Group expects global copper demand to reach 52.5 million tonnes annually by 2050, up 72% from 2021. Previously, the mining company had warned against a possible rise in copper prices as the demand outweighed supply.\n\nAlso Read: BHP Averts Strike At World’s Largest Copper Mine, Stabilizes Chinese Copper Supply\n\nCopper is indispensable for industries pivotal to the zero-emission target, including power cables, electric vehicles, and solar farms. Therefore, a crisis in the metal could hamper the prospects of companies ranging from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to EV companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and more lest Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), fails to supply AI chips to the Big Techs due to the copper crisis.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Patrick Jones projected a four million metric tonnes copper deficit by 2030, courtesy of EVs and renewable energy demand. The analyst also blamed China’s weak demand, which accounts for over 50% of global copper demand.\n\nBHP Group’s copper production rose 9% in fiscal 2024 for the second successive year, reaching 1.9 million tons. The average realized copper prices increased in fiscal 2024.\n\nBHP Group has snapped a 50% stake in Argentina’s Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects, which have the potential to help accomplish a 70% increase in global copper demand by 2050.\n\nBHP Group expects the production to grow by another 4% in fiscal 2025, reaching 1.85 million tons–2.05 million tons.\n\nBHP Group’s stock has been down close to 14% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through the Avantis International Equity ETF (NYSE:AVDTHE) and Dimensional International Core Equity Market ETF (NYSE:DFAI).\n\nPrice Action: BHP stock is up 0.42% at $53.11 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBHP To Unlock South American Copper Riches: Partners With Lundin For Filo Acquisition\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

        "title": "Mobility tech deal value was up 13.9% quarter over quarter, led by autonomous driving startups, according to PitchBook",
        "content": "My favorite thing about mobility tech is that it can mean all sorts of things, from EVs to scooters to underwater drones.\n\nBut autonomous driving ruled the day in mobility tech in Q2 2024, in which some big-name deals got done by big-name investors. Nvidia particularly has been involved in a number of high-profile, autonomous driving-related deals. Consider: In recent months, Wayve raised a $1.1 billion Series C led by Nvidia, Eclipse Ventures, and SoftBank, while Scale AI raised a $1 billion Series F led by Accel and Nvidia. Nvidia was also in the mix as an investor in Waabi’s $200 million Series B, which was led by Uber and Khosla Ventures.\n\nQ2 saw some green shoots for mobility tech as a sector, as VCs invested $6.7 billion in mobility tech, marking a 13.9% quarter-over-quarter increase in deal value, according to PitchBook. This also marked deal value growth of 52.8% year over year—though the spike in deal value hinges in part on those large autonomous driving-focused funding rounds.\n\nIn fact, mobility tech deal count in Q2 was down 27.4% year over year and about 30% year-to-date. To me what that suggests is the same story as we’ve ultimately heard in other sectors—that the biggest names are drawing lots of funding, while smaller or less-well-known startups are more likely to be left in the lurch.\n\nAutonomous driving has been hot this summer, as Alphabet-owned Waymo lifted the waiting list in San Francisco and became available to everyone. Meanwhile, Amazon-owned Zoox is similarly preparing to roll out to customers, my colleague Jessica Mathews recently reported. But as autonomous driving gains real-world traction, scrutiny on (and concerns about) robotaxi companies has ramped up. GM-owned Cruise has particularly become a story about how quickly an autonomous driving startup can endanger pedestrians, as Mathews has previously reported.\n\nNow, I'll level with you: All these autonomous driving-related rounds are all fine and good, but I’m stuck on the underwater drones. According to PitchBook, that market is expected to reach $15 billion by 2032, up from $4.4 billion last year. That figure includes military applications, but it turns out that on its own marine data is already a roughly $1.3 billion market, projected to grow. If there are any marine data-gatherers out there, you know where to find me.\n\nScoop… My colleague Leo Schwartz scooped the news on crypto-focused Hack VC’s new $77 million fund.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘This Wasn’t A Demand Issue’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there’s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he’s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it’s worth paying attention to what’s going right.\n\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I’m willing to declare that there’s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I’m not trying to call a bottom, let’s make that crystal clear, but I think it’s worth taking a hard look at what’s actually going right—not just what’s going wrong.\"\n\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it’s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn’t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\n\"Sure, the market’s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren’t even oversold yet—at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there’s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don’t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\n\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve’s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let’s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That’s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won’t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it’s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"But let’s be realistic: You can’t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there’s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn’t cut rates when business is booming. That’s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday’s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can’t have it both ways.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer addressed concerns about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock weakness and whether it signals an impending recession. He clarified that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s recent quarter wasn’t impacted by low demand but rather by supply issues with its high-end Blackwell chips. The problem was not with demand but with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s ability to produce enough chips due to these constraints. He noted that such fluctuations in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market cap are not unprecedented and will likely occur again.\n\n\"What about tech weakness as a recession signal? I keep hearing Nvidia may have missed its quarter due to economic softness. Let’s put that rumor to bed. The issue wasn’t demand; it was Nvidia’s inability to produce enough of its high-end Blackwell chips due to supply constraints. This wasn’t a demand issue.\n\nNow, let's address the overblown narrative surrounding Nvidia's stock drop, which wiped out $279 billion in market capitalization. In isolation, that sounds terrifying, but keep this in perspective: Nvidia started the year with a $1.22 trillion market cap and soared to $2.93 trillion by the end of August. Yesterday’s drop to $2.65 trillion? Sure, it’s a big number, but in the context of a stock that’s up over 100% this year, it’s not as catastrophic as it seems.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Nvidia’s market cap has dropped over $200 billion in a day, and it likely won’t be the last. Yet, I know what you're thinking—Nvidia’s stock is on fragile ground. That’s fair. There are still far too many investors who don’t understand what Nvidia does or how it profits from the brainpower of CEO Jensen Huang and his team.\n\nThe stock can’t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. Meanwhile, we’re waiting to see how quickly Nvidia can get its Blackwell chip rolling and improve gross margins—the real reason for the stock's recent pummeling.\"\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading player in the tech industry, particularly in AI, gaming, and high-performance computing. For Q2 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported record revenue of $13.51 billion, up 101% from the previous year, driven by a massive surge in demand for AI chips. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s data center revenue soared by 171% to $10.32 billion, reflecting the growing need for GPUs in AI applications like generative AI and large language models.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s net income also jumped to $6.19 billion from $656 million a year earlier, and its earnings per share reached $2.70, exceeding Wall Street's forecast. Recent updates highlight NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s expanding role in AI. In August 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) introduced its next-generation AI chip, the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which is designed to further accelerate AI tasks.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "US regulatory power faces fresh test as new Supreme Court term nears",
        "content": "By John Kruzel\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A case involving the vape industry gives the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to further erode the authority of federal regulatory agencies following other major rulings as the justices gird for a new term featuring important business-related questions.\n\nThe nine-month term, which begins on Oct. 7, also brings cases involving tech giants Nvidia and Meta's Facebook that could make it harder for private plaintiffs to win securities fraud lawsuits against companies in federal courts.\n\nThe vape industry case is the latest front in a regulatory rollback effort in the courts cheered by conservatives and business interests to weaken the federal agency bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements executive action.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a June 28 decision powered by its 6-3 conservative majority, overturned a legal principle called \"Chevron deference\" established by the justices 40 years ago that had called on judges to defer to federal agencies in interpreting laws they administer. That case involved an industry challenge to a U.S. regulatory agency's fish conservation program.\n\nThe new case does not carry the same high stakes but nonetheless affords the conservative justices an opportunity to scrutinize actions of a regulatory agency, in this case the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's denial of applications to sell flavored vape products.\n\nThe justices in June also issued rulings faulting actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Environmental Protection Agency. Additional cases challenging federal agencies have the potential to reach the justices this term.\n\nThe court will hear the FDA's appeal of a lower court's ruling that the agency failed to follow proper legal procedures under federal law when it denied applications by e-cigarette liquid makers Triton Distribution and Vapetasia to bring their nicotine-containing products to market.\n\nThe companies had filed FDA applications in 2020 for products with flavors such as sour grape, pink lemonade and crème brulee, and names including \"Jimmy The Juice Man Strawberry Astronaut\" and \"Suicide Bunny Bunny Season.\"\n\nAlthough the FDA maintains that it has not categorically banned flavored e-cigarette products, companies seeking its approval must clear a high legal bar because, according to an agency court filing, such products pose a \"known and substantial risk to youth.\" The FDA has approved only 27 e-cigarette products - all tobacco or menthol flavored - while denying more than a million other applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The FDA case is another attack on agency authority and power, so it seems a bit in keeping with the seminal cases from last term that stripped agencies of various powers or left them more open to attack,\" said Karen Woody, a professor at Washington & Lee University School of Law in Virginia.\n\nThe court has not yet set a date for arguments in the case.\n\nSECURITIES FRAUD CASES\n\nThe justices will hear separate bids by Facebook and Nvidia to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits. The Supreme Court already has weakened the federal agency that polices securities fraud - the Securities and Exchange Commission. These new cases now could make it more difficult for private litigants to hold companies to account for alleged securities fraud.\n\n\"These cases represent new opportunities for the Supreme Court to narrow the pinhole - so even fewer federal fraud claims can proceed past the early stages - or widen it,\" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School in Louisiana.\n\nFacebook and Nvidia filed separate appeals after a lower court allowed class action securities fraud lawsuits to proceed against them.\n\nThe justices on Nov. 6 are due to hear arguments in Facebook's bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the social media platform of misleading investors in 2017 and 2018 about the misuse of its user data by the company and third parties.\n\nThe court is due on Nov. 13 to hear arguments in a similar effort by Nvidia to scuttle litigation accusing the artificial intelligence chipmaker of misleading investors about how much of its sales went to the volatile cryptocurrency industry.\n\nWoody said the business community should take heed given the weighty stakes. Woody added that she expects the court to rule in favor of the companies in both cases. She joined a court brief favoring Facebook.\n\n\"The Nvidia and Facebook cases read together could end up with companies needing to disclose more information and plaintiffs with a slightly lower bar for pleading requirements in a class action,\" Woody said. \"That combination could have companies worried about a potential increase in liability exposure.\"\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas law professor Benjamin Edwards said the court's momentous term that ended in July continues to reverberate.\n\n\"I suspect the story in the business community for the next few years will be how to adjust\" to the new legal landscape, Edwards added.\n\nAnat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Ohio, said the business community is likely to try to build on its considerable success in recent terms of \"gutting regulatory agencies' ability to create and enforce rules on industry.\"\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Palantir (PLTR)\n\nShares in data-analytics company Palantir have more than doubled so far this year, and Bank of America (BofA) believes the stock will head even higher, Fortune reported.\n\nBofA has maintained a buy rating on Palantir and raised its price target on the stock to $50 from $30, according to a note released last week. Pre-market open on Monday, Palantir was trading at over $35 per share.\n\nBofA analysts reportedly said the bank believed Palantir's \"capabilities, technology and path forward\" were facing a misunderstanding on Wall Street.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious ahead of busy week for interest rate decisions\n\n“The upcoming S&P 500 inclusion provides a watershed moment for institutional investors to revisit what they ‘know’ about PLTR,\" they said.\n\nPalantir shares jumped earlier this month following the news that it, along with server-maker Dell (DELL) and insurer Erie Indemnity (ERIE) are set to join the S&P 500 (^GSPC) before market open on 23 September.\n\nPlaytech (PTEC.L)\n\nGambling software company Playtech has said it expects adjusted profits for 2024 to be slightly ahead of market expectations, mainly driven by strong performance in its business-to-business (B2B) division.\n\nPlaytech shares jumped nearly 8% on Monday on the back of the company's trading update.\n\nThe company said its B2B division had performed well in the first half of the year, \"driven by a combination of revenue growth in the Americas and a focus on tighter cost control\".\n\nPlaytech also announced that it had reached an agreement with Mexican sports betting company Caliente, to hold a 30.8% stake in Caliente Interactive, which will be the new holding company for their joint venture Caliplay.\n\nThe deal follows a legal dispute in which Caliplay stopped paying software and service fees to Playtech. However, Playtech said Caliplay had resumed paying the fees, with it having received more than €150m (£127m), or over 80%, of the unpaid amount.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nIn the business-to-consumer side of the company, Playtech said it was in discussions with Flutter (FLTR.L) around the potential sale of its Italian division Snaitech.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"You can see why gambling software firm Playtech is considering getting shot of its consumer facing Snaitech business, based on today’s trading update.\n\n\"The business-to-business arm is the one driving earnings to be slightly above expectations for 2024 — supported by good growth across the Atlantic and tight cost control.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPlaytech is due to release its half-year results on 30 September.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nShares in chipmaker Intel were up nearly 4% in pre-market trading. This followed news on Friday that the European Commission had given Poland the green light to grant the company more than $1.9bn in state aid to support its chip assembly and testing plant.\n\nHowever, Intel has experienced challenges this year, with the stock slumping 61% year-to-date. The company recently announced it was planning to layoff more than 15% of its workforce, around 15,000 employees, as part of cost cutting measures.\n\n\"This is the biggest restructuring of Intel I'd say since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance in early August.\n\nSeparately, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance that Intel faces an \"uphill battle\" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nHari rated the stock as a sell, as he believed the company needed to some time to get its technology on par with rivals.\n\nIntel missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings, citing more challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to increase production of its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The company also decided to suspend its dividend, which will come into effect in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nBajaj Finance (BAJFINANCE.BO)\n\nIndia's biggest shadow bank Bajaj Finance floated its housing finance arm last week, with shares being oversubscribed by nearly 64 times in the initial public offering (IPO).\n\nBajaj Housing Finance raised $782m in its first day of bidding last Monday, making it the most sought-after IPO in India this year, as investors looked to tap into the country's growing real estate market.\n\nShares in Bajaj Housing Finance more than doubled on Monday. The stock jumped 136% to 165 rupees (£1.49), compared with an offer price of 70 rupees.\n\nIn addition to sector demand, it also the reputation of its parent Bajaj Group that has bolstered the stock in its debut.\n\n“The group has a proven track record of wealth creation,” said Pranav Bhavsar, co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 Is Surviving Big Tech’s Slide as ‘Other 493’ Catch Up",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stock market has recovered most of the losses suffered in its summer selloff. While the S&P 500 Index has bounced back before, this time is unique because it isn’t being led by Big Tech — instead it’s everyone else’s turn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine' The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads\n\nTechnology giants like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. have led gains in the equities benchmark for much of the last two years, with investors attracted to their booming profits and exposure to artificial intelligence. But now traders are rotating into sectors like real estate, utilities and consumer staples amid fears of sputtering economic growth and with the Federal Reserve preparing to start cutting interest rates as soon Wednesday.\n\nSince the S&P 500 peaked on July 16, the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — have mostly slumped, with the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index falling 5.3%. And while the broader equities benchmark is down less than 1% over that time, largely due to the S&P’s outsized weightings of those fast growing tech giants, usually sleepy sectors have led the index by a wide mark, with both real estate and utilities gaining 11%.\n\nThose figures include last week’s rally in the S&P 500, which was led by the tech sector.\n\n“Investors love to look at companies that are going from earnings declines to earnings gains,” Michael Casper, an equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “That’s kind of leading them away from tech and to the other 493 stocks that were cast aside.”\n\nRecession Test\n\nThe rotation has been aided by expectations for monetary policy easing. But it’s also a testament to the improving outlook for profits in the rest of the market at a time when big spending by tech giants is raising concerns about their margins.\n\nWhether it’s a blip or a longer-term trend, however, will likely rest on the path of the economy. Markets will get a big clue on that from the Fed this week, with traders roughly split on the central bank delivering a quarter- or half-point reduction.\n\n“We don’t believe we’re going into a recession, and the stocks that will begin to show leadership are the cyclicals that will benefit from higher economic growth and lower interest rates,” said Adam Grossman, chief investment officer for global equities at Riverfront Investment Group, who added that large cap tech stocks remain his firm’s biggest overweight position.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeterioration in the economy would likely benefit defensive sectors, but that also tends to be a good environment for tech stocks, according to Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\n\n“If there’s some uncertainty, our view is investors will continue to pay a premium for growth prospects,” Lerner said in an interview. “If things continue to slow down, defensive would continue to do well. In either environment, slowdown or still some stability, I think tech does well.”\n\nAnother factor helping sectors outside of tech is improving earnings outlooks. Take health care as an example: After seven consecutive quarters of shrinking profits, earnings from health-care companies rose 16% in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That expansion is expected to continue through the remainder of the year, with profit growth projected to hit 45% in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nTech Slows\n\nOf course, earnings from tech behemoths remain strong. They just aren’t climbing at the rapid clip they were in the past couple of years, which was driven by steady sales growth and a focus on efficiency that resulted in hundreds of thousands of job cuts across the industry.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven companies posted profit growth of 36% in the second quarter. That’s impressive, but down from more than 50% in the prior three quarters. And earnings are projected to expand between 17% and 20% in the next four quarters, according to BI data.\n\nPart of the selloff in Big Tech stocks last month was related to the companies’ heavy spending on gear used for AI computing. Last quarter, Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms poured more than $50 billion combined into capital expenditures.\n\nA big beneficiary of all that cash flying around is Nvidia, whose semiconductors have become prized for the types of computing required for AI models. But more broadly, it also has raised concerns among investors about profit margins at the chipmaker’s biggest customers — particularly with few signs so far that the spending is translating into the kind of revenue growth required to financially justify the outlays.\n\nWhile the downturn has cut multiples for many tech stocks, they’re still elevated. Microsoft, for example, is priced at 32 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from a high of 35 in July, but well above an average of 25 over the past decade.\n\nCheaper valuations in other areas of the market are likely to continue to attract investors. However, that doesn’t mean technology won’t continue to do well despite the boom in AI-related stocks like Nvidia prompting comparisons to the dot-com bubble, according to Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners.\n\n“The other 493, being a lot cheaper, probably do get a bit of a bid, but it doesn’t mean you throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said. “These companies are printing money hand over fist. That’s a big difference from 2000.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Vegas Sphere’s First Live Sporting Event Will Be an Expensive One EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 AI Stocks That Can Crush the S&amp;P 500 Through 2030",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has delivered outstanding returns over the last year and is currently up around 23%. However, the index has returned an average annual return of about 10% going back decades, so if you want to find market-beating stocks, you need to look for companies that can sustain high double-digit growth for several years.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market is a promising field to look for growth stocks. Statista estimates spending on AI technology to increase from $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030.\n\nHere are two AI stocks that have crushed the S&P 500 over the last year and can outpace the index through the end of the decade.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nShares of Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) have soared to new highs as the AI software provider reported accelerating growth this year. The company has primarily depended on government deals. However, it's starting to see an increasing number of corporations invest in its software, which could catapult the stock to market-crushing returns over the next six years.\n\nIn the second quarter, Palantir reported a robust 27% year-over-year increase in total revenue. The company closed 10 deals worth more than $10 million. These results are impressive, considering the headwinds many software companies are experiencing this year due to tightening enterprise spending.\n\nCompanies seem to be prioritizing investment in AI. After using Palantir, these companies are seeing positive returns, such as faster completion of tasks and better price optimization for products, which can help a business boost profit margins.\n\nAn important advantage for Palantir is the use of its software engineers as part of the sales process. The engineers work with customers to set up the software and show them ways to get more out of it. This gives Palantir an enormous advantage in driving higher sales from customers.\n\nPalantir's high-margin software business should create outstanding shareholder returns in the coming years. Wall Street analysts are projecting Palantir's annualized earnings to grow 85% over the next five years, which implies a substantial increase in the company's margins. There will be ups and downs, but investors should expect Palantir stock to at least double in value from current share prices by 2030 and outperform the market averages.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is estimated to control at least 70% of the AI chip market. It has long dominated the market for graphics processing units (GPUs), which have the processing bandwidth to handle the demands of AI training. Nvidia's lead in GPUs has translated to phenomenal returns for shareholders in recent years as companies continue to invest in building more data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's data center revenue more than doubled year over year last quarter to $26 billion, and the expanding opportunities beyond the U.S. should allow the company to maintain its momentum into next year. While it prepares to launch the next-generation Blackwell AI computing platform, management also continues to emphasize the burgeoning opportunity to supply AI infrastructure for countries worldwide.\n\nForeign nations want to use their own language and culture with generative AI tools, and they are turning to Nvidia to help them build the infrastructure to make this happen. For example, Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology uses thousands of Nvidia H200 GPUs for its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer.\n\nWhile Nvidia continues to cash in on the enterprise wave, sovereign AI infrastructure could be the next tidal wave that creates significant growth opportunities for the GPU leader. Management believes its sovereign AI business will surpass $10 billion this year.\n\nNvidia's share price has soared 160% over the last year, but that has been completely driven by its data center growth. The stock still trades at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29 using next year's consensus earnings estimates. With analysts forecasting annualized earnings growth of 52% over the next five years, Nvidia stock could significantly outpace the return of the average stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Magnificent Seven is less expensive. Buying these tech giants now could pay off",
        "content": "Warren Buffett once said it can pay “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”\n\nSince the GenAI boom took hold last year, investors have hopped on the bandwagon of the Magnificent Seven—a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—and the group accounted for half the S&P 500’s total gains in 2023, according to a report from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAfter a blistering start to 2024, however, many of these large-cap tech giants have fallen back down to Earth. Could it be time to buy the dip? Here are three members of the Magnificent Seven that Wall Street remains high on.\n\nApple\n\nSpeaking of Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha made plenty of headlines when the Berkshire Hathaway chairman sold half of its immense holding of Apple stock. It’s worth noting, however, that the iPhone maker remains Berkshire’s biggest equity holding overall.\n\nSome believe the stock, which is up 20% year to date, is overvalued. Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, understands why Monday’s unveiling of the iPhone 16—the first with significant GenAI features—didn't spark a major reaction from investors. Nonetheless, he remains excited about the future of Apple’s wearables as new healthcare features are added, from sleep apnea detection on the Apple Watch to \"clinical grade\" hearing aids with the new AirPods Pro.\n\n“Some of this wearable stuff is kind of being not talked about enough,” Zino said, “maybe because the AI stuff is taking all the limelight.”\n\nThe stock closed at $222.50 Friday, with the Street’s consensus price target sitting just short of $250.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500’s total returns during the first half the year and is up almost 150% year to date. Analysts have made clear investors should not expect the chip designer’s shares to continue appreciating at the same pace, but the recent sell-off may have presented an attractive entry point.\n\nNvidia’s breakneck growth will inevitably slow, but demand for its GPUs remains insatiable. The stock popped over 13% this week as CEO Jensen Huang spoke Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs conference about juggling customers' needs, underlining why the company is still, as Zino put it, the “center of the universe” when it comes to AI.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to no one, he said, that the tech giants, as well as smaller customers, hungrily await Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. That may be one reason the stock, which closed just above $119 on Friday, has a consensus price target topping $153.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nHowever, the most underweighted mega-cap name, Zino said, is likely Alphabet, with the Google parent’s shares down 5% this month and up only 13.5% year to date, trailing the broader market.\n\nA federal judge recently ruled Google had illegally monopolized the search market, which Bernstein analysts said could unleash future litigation that could cost the company over $100 billion. The Justice Department is even reportedly considering an effort to break up the business.\n\nIn recent notes to inventors, however, Zino said he believes those concerns are already discounted in the stock price. Investors are under-appreciating Google’s AI monetization opportunities, he said, as well as assets like Waymo, Google’s autonomous driving technology.\n\nOn Friday, Uberannounced it will dispatch Waymo’s robotaxis in Austin and Atlanta by early 2025, expanding the footprint of Google’s self-driving cars beyond California and Arizona. Google shares closed above the $158 mark Friday, still below its consensus price target of roughly $204.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock vs. Palantir Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "content": "Consultancy PwC estimates artificial intelligence (AI) will contribute more than $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Investors hoping to benefit are piling into AI stocks, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) have been two of the most popular choices.\n\nIn the last two years, Nvidia shares surged 728%, and Palantir shares advanced 348%. But Wall Street analysts expect the stocks to move in opposite directions over the next 12 months, as detailed below:\n\nNvidia's median target of $150 per share implies 26% upside from its current share price of $119. Palantir's median target of $28 per share implies 20% downside from its current share price of $35.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these AI stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads such as training machine learning models and running AI applications. In March, Forrester Research wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nHowever, the chipmaker is truly formidable because it provides a full-stack computing platform that comprises adjacent hardware, software, and services. Nvidia has secured leadership in generative AI networking gear, and its first server central processing unit (CPU) is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, according to CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nLikewise, Nvidia says its software and services business will approach a $2 billion revenue run rate this year due to strength from its AI Enterprise offering. Nvidia AI Enterprise is a software platform that streamlines data preparation and model training, as well as the development and deployment of AI applications. The platform includes frameworks that address specific use cases, including conversational agents, recommender systems, and autonomous robotics.\n\nNvidia reported strong financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion on strong demand for AI hardware and software, and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings surged 152% to $0.68 per diluted share. More importantly, the company is well positioned to maintain that momentum.\n\nNvidia's next generation of data center GPUs, called Blackwell, will ramp up later this year, and the market is rife with anticipation. Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang predicted, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to grow at 49% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That estimate makes the current valuation of 54 times adjusted earnings seem reasonable. Patient investors should consider purchasing a small position in Nvidia stock today.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir sells data analytics software. Its platforms help enterprises manage data, develop machine learning models, and integrate those digital assets into applications that improve decision-making. Palantir describes its core software products, Foundry and Gotham, as operating systems that connect data, decisions, and operations. Use cases range from managing supply chains to mitigating financial risk to optimizing manufacturing.\n\nLast year, Palantir added support for large language models and generative AI to Gotham and Foundry with AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). The company also reoriented its go-to-market strategy around the new product with AIP Bootcamps, instructional events where potential customers learn to use AIP on their own data in a matter of days.\n\nIn August, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as a leader among AI and machine learning platform vendors. Analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Palantir was awarded the highest score for its current product offering, but competitors Alphabet and C3.ai earned higher scores for their growth strategy.\n\nPalantir reported encouraging financial results in the second quarter. Its customer count increased by 41% to 593, and the average customer spent 14% more over the past year. In turn, revenue increased 27% to $678 million, the fifth sequential acceleration, and non-GAAP net income jumped 80% to $0.09 per diluted share.\n\nGoing forward, CEO Alex Karp expects the company to maintain its momentum. \"The persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no signs of relenting.\"\n\nThe problem is valuation. Wall Street forecasts adjusted earnings growth of 22% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 109 times adjusted earnings look pricey. Personally, I agree with Wall Street. Palantir looks overvalued, and I would not be surprised to see a substantial correction in the future.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘It’s A Supply Problem, Not A Demand Problem’",
        "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List: 10 Stocks to Monitor Closely. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer emphasized the risks of straying too far from technology stocks, particularly the dominant tech companies, in today’s market. He pointed out how JP Morgan, despite being one of the best-performing banks, caused a stir by cutting its forecast, warning that estimates might be overly optimistic. This news hurt the broader market, dropping it by 93 points, although the S&P 500 saw a slight rise of 0.54%, and the tech-driven NASDAQ gained 0.84%.\n\n“In this market, every time you stray too far from technology, especially the tech titans, you ultimately get slapped in the face by reality. That’s what happened today when the largest, and arguably best-performing, bank in the world, laid a huge egg with its forecast. They told us the estimates are too high, maybe way too high. That spoiled a big chunk of the market, ultimately dipping 93 points. The S&P inched up 0.54%, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ still gained 0.84%.”\n\nCramer explained that since the Federal Reserve gave positive signals, investors had shifted away from tech into other areas of the market. This shift was part of the “broadening out” that many investors had been waiting for, as it was believed to signal a healthier market. Financial stocks, which make up around 13.3% of the S&P 500, had been a source of excitement for those tired of relying on the leading tech stocks.\n\n“For the past couple of months, ever since the Fed gave us the all-clear signal, we’ve seen money flow out of tech into long-neglected regions of the stock market. This is the fabled “broadening out” that people spent all year clamoring for. When we bring in more groups of winners, we’re supposed to have a much healthier market, at least that’s what they say. There are tons of financials in the S&P 500, about 13.3% of the index and the strength in those stocks was a source of much joy for everyone who had gotten sick of The Magnificent Seven.”\n\nHowever, as Cramer noted, economic uncertainty and disappointing forecasts from bank companies disrupted this broader market strength. Daniel Pinto, the bank company’s COO, dashed hopes by signaling that the outlook for the bank wasn’t as strong as expected. The key issue was that net interest income, a critical measure for banks, was projected to miss expectations due to reduced capital market activity. For Cramer, this underperformance highlighted the danger of moving away from tech stocks too soon.\n\n“But a funny thing happened on the way to that broadened-out market: we got economic choppiness. Or to use a more accurate phrase, we got guide-downs that were intolerable to any of the leaders, and the kiss of death to the stock of the bank. You can’t be a leader when you’re slashing your forecast for H2. That’s when the shareholders kick you to the curb and find someone new to follow.\n\nBut today, Daniel Pinto, the bank’s President and Chief Operating Officer, lowered the boom on the optimists who desperately wanted to buy something other than tech. The big bank told us that things are less bullish than we thought. There isn’t as much capital markets activity as we’d hoped this quarter, and most importantly, the estimates for next year are too high because of a likely miss on net interest income.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Among Jim Cramer’s Exclusive Stock to Monitor Closely?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer believes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s recent revenue shortfall is primarily due to production delays for their new AI chip, Blackwell. He emphasizes that the demand for this chip remains extremely high, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making progress in addressing the supply issues. Cramer doesn’t see this as a significant setback for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s overall performance.\n\n“Now, I don’t see much evidence of this, though the bears will point to NVIDIA Corporation’s failure to report a spectacular revenue beat. But that only happened because their new AI chip, Blackwell, got delayed. They’re having trouble producing it at scale, which is totally reasonable. But they’ve basically solved the problem now. It’s a supply problem, not a demand problem. Demand is off the charts.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers a strong bullish case, supported by its outstanding financial performance and leadership in AI and GPU technology. In Q2 FY2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted remarkable earnings, with revenue soaring to $13.51 billion, a 101% year-over-year increase, largely driven by booming demand for AI and data center products. Notably, data center revenue surged by 171% to $10.32 billion, as businesses ramped up investments in AI infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strategic partnerships with companies like VMware Inc. (NYSE:VMW), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Hugging Face further bolster its position in the AI ecosystem, while its H100 GPUs continue to set benchmarks in AI model training. New product releases, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and AI Workbench, reinforce NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s growth across multiple sectors. Looking forward, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) projects even stronger results for Q3 2024, with expected revenue of $16 billion and gross margins between 74.8% and 75.5%.\n\nAnalysts remain highly optimistic about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s future, driven by its technological dominance and the expanding global demand for AI. This combination of innovation, strategic partnerships, and market leadership makes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nOverall CPB ranks 2nd on our list of exclusive stocks Jim Cramer recommends to monitor closely. While we acknowledge the potential of CPB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CPB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Split Update: Down 2% Since June, History Says the AI Stock Will Do This Next",
        "content": "For many investors, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has emerged as the quintessential artificial intelligence (AI) stock. That's because the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center tasks, such as training machine learning models and running AI applications.\n\nNvidia shares have surged 780% since the generative AI application ChatGPT went viral in late 2022. That event triggered a tidal wave of AI infrastructure spending that is still building momentum, and Nvidia has been one of the biggest beneficiaries. In turn, the stock has become a staple of the AI trade.\n\nNvidia reset its soaring share price in June by conducting a 10-for-1 stock split. Shares have since tumbled about 2%, but history says Nvidia stock may have further to fall.\n\nStock-split stocks like Nvidia typically outperform the S&P 500\n\nGenerally speaking, companies conduct forward stock splits after substantial share price appreciation, which itself is suggestive of compelling growth prospects and a competitive edge. Companies that possess those qualities tend to produce above-average returns for shareholders.\n\nIndeed, Bank of America reviewed data back to 1980 and found a correlation. Companies that split their stock returned an average of 25.4% during the 12 months after announcing the split. By comparison, the S&P 500 returned an average of 11.9% during the same period.\n\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia announced its latest stock split after the market closed on May 22, 2024. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $95 per share. History says its share price will increase 25.4% to $119 by May 2025. But the stock already trades at $119 per share, leaving zero implied upside (or downside) over the next eight months.\n\nNvidia has performed poorly following past stock splits\n\nWe can also make predictions about Nvidia's future performance by reviewing company-specific data. For instance, the chipmaker completed five stock splits prior to the most recent one. The chart below shows how the stock performed during the 12 months and 24 months following those five splits.\n\nStock Split Date 12-Month Return 24-Month Return June 2000 28% (52%) September 2001 (72%) (49%) April 2006 1% (6%) September 2007 (70%) (53%) July 2021 (4%) 145% Average (23%) (3%)\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, Nvidia has usually performed poorly following stock splits. Its share price has declined by an average of 23% during the first 12 months and was still down by 3% on average after 24 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what that could mean: Nvidia completed its 10-for-1 split after the market closed on June 7. The stock traded at a split-adjusted $121 per share. History says its share price will drop 23% to $93 by June 2025. The stock currently trades at $119 per share, so the implied downside is 22% over the next nine months.\n\nHaving said that, past performance is never a guarantee of future results. Moreover, most of the stock splits listed in the chart took place within 12 months of a recession, so Nvidia had little chance of posting positive returns. Going forward, whether Nvidia is a good investment depends on its financial performance and what investors are willing to pay to own shares of the company.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in artificial intelligence chips\n\nNvidia dominates the market for data center GPUs, chips used to speed up workloads like AI applications. The company accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments in 2023, essentially unchanged from the prior year, and those GPUs account for more than 80% of AI chips.\n\nThere are two reasons for that dominance. First, Nvidia designs the most powerful GPUs money can buy, and rapid product development keeps its GPUs on the cutting edge in terms of performance. Second, Nvidia complements its chips with a robust ecosystem of software libraries and developer tools called CUDA. The CUDA platform streamlines the building of GPU-accelerated applications.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, graphics processor sales are projected to grow at 27% annually through 2030, driven by the proliferation of machine learning and AI. Nvidia's sales should increase at a similar pace, plus or minus a few percentage points. However, earnings may grow a bit faster due to share repurchases and potential margin expansion driven by pricing power.\n\nWall Street forecasts adjusted earnings will increase at 35% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus makes the current valuation of 54 times earnings look tolerable. Investors should consider buying a small position in Nvidia stock today, provided they are comfortable with volatility and willing to hold their shares for at least three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish on This Aggressive Growth Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other aggressive growth stocks.\n\nIf you're putting money in the stock market, it's more likely than not that growth is the thing that's on your mind. After all, protecting against inflation doesn't require making risky bets in firms that might see share prices drop in the blink of an eye. Financial instruments, such as inflation protected securities, offer investors the comfort of knowing that their savings do not lose value, meaning that passive income or growth remain some of the most popular reasons why people put their faith in stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to identifying growth stocks, there are several approaches that are followed. These depend on the business model and the fundamentals of the firms being analyzed. For instance, for profitable companies with a positive net income, the price to earnings ratio is used. However, a large portion of high growth stocks aren't profitable as they reinvest their revenue into expanding market share. This leads to high operating costs, and these firms are valued either through the EV/Sales or EV/EBITDA ratios, depending on whether the firm generates a positive operating income or not.\n\nBoth the P/E and other ratios tell us the premium that the market is placing over a firm's ability to generate money. For instance, one of the major semiconductor companies in the world, which ranks 6th on our list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News, had a P/E ratio of 112x by the end of Q1 2018. This was before the age of AI, and its two peers in the chip industry had 37x for the chip stock that's Wall Street's AI darling and 19x for the struggling American chip giant that's also the only leading edge US based chip manufacturer. Safe to say, the 112x P/E foretold the story of times to come, and since Q1 2018, the stock has gained a whopping 1,386%.\n\nOf course, this stock's story isn't the only aggressive growth stock story that we have. While its revenue has grown by 254% between 2018 and 2023, one of the best stories of an aggressive growth stock of our age is Elon Musk's electric vehicle company. The firm had a stunning P/E ratio of 1,120x by the close of 2020 at a time when the retail investing frenzy was at a feverish pitch. Its first profitable quarter, i.e. the quarter ending in June 2020 saw its P/E jump to 512x at a time when its larger and traditional rival was trading at 23.89x. Since then, the shares have gained 180%, and their gains have been trimmed due to the turmoil in the EV industry stemming from supply chain constraints, margin eroding fierce competition, and high interest rates. The stock's all time returns sit at 17,569%.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting gears, the electric vehicle company had an EV/Revenue ratio of 23.56x in August 2012. Similar ratios are typically common in the cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) industry. As opposed to car manufacturers that face high manufacturing and indirect costs, cloud and SaaS firms reap the benefits of a low cost business model as it takes less money to develop software than to operate an industrial plant. This also means that the firms have more cash at their disposal to focus on growth, and the low margins coupled with the high reinvestment have a direct implication on their valuation.\n\nLooking at the SaaS sector's median EV/Revenue multiples, data shows that they are affected by interest rates. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of investing in the stock market, and they also decrease the value of future SaaS earnings in today's dollars as investors can earn more money today through interest. This is also evident in the data, as before the pandemic, the median EV/Revenue multiple was 11x. After the pandemic, when the Federal Reserve was forced to lower rates to nearly zero to avoid economic destruction, the SaaS median EV/Revenue multiple shot to 20x in 2021 as investors found little utility in earning money through interest.\n\nNow, when the rates are at historic highs, the median multiple over the past 18 months has hovered around 7x. The post pandemic economic disruption has also had an effect on SaaS growth, since pre pandemic, the median revenue growth rate for these firms was 30%, and in the low rate era as the demand for technology services boomed, it grew to 33%. However, the high rates after that, which slowed down business spending, have also impacted the revenue growth rate which is around 17% as of Q1.\n\nBuilding on this, the SaaS and the broader software industry are also dealing with the impacts of AI. Among the use cases of the new technology is programming, with research from the hedge fund Coatue Management sharing some key insights. Its research shows that high rates might not be the only reason for the sector that's historically been thought to have constituted the highest number of aggressive growth stocks. As per Coatue, compared to a peak value of 30%, the median next twelve month revenue growth rate for the SaaS sector right now is just 1%. This appears to be influenced by AI's impact, as not only has AI reduced the cost of writing code (meaning that SaaS customers can use AI to make their own software) but it is also impacting the traditional seat based model of the industry. This model sees SaaS firms charge customers on the basis of the number of people or 'seats' that have access to their software, and the seat model is now being replaced by consumption driven models.\n\nThis transition is already playing out in the industry, with one software firm sharing during its Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"Subscription revenue was $278.1 million, a 21% increase over last year. Now, with the transition that we went through to pay-as-you-go consumption pricing, we are engaging in a much larger number of smaller transactions of shorter term. This offers us greater revenue visibility and greater revenue predictability. Our average TCV [TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE] has plummeted as a result from over $16 million in fiscal year ’19 to $900,000 last quarter. As we work through this pricing transition, we are seeing, as expected, okay, at first a decline and now a return to accelerating revenue growth. Also as expected, we are seeing a reduction in RPO.\"\n\nSo, as the aggressive growth stock sector appears to be evolving, we decided to see which such stock hedge funds are buying.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy, we first ranked the 155 stock holdings of a popular ETF that selects stocks based on the belief that their earnings will grow faster than the average. Then, out of this list, those stocks with a 30%+ annual revenue growth rate during the latest quarter were chosen. These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024 and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nRevenue Growth: 122.40%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's largest chip designer in terms of market cap, owing nearly all of its fortunes to the indispensable nature of its products to running AI workloads. The firm's Grace Hopper and Blackwell chips are industry leaders, and its competitive dominance coupled with a tight supply due to excessive demand also means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys substantive pricing power in the market. Another key strength is the firm's CUDA platform, which enables users to exercise greater control over their products. However, the pricing power might prove to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Achilles' Heel, too. If you read our coverage of SNOW, the 5th stock in this list, you'll know that its shares tanked by 14% after the latest earnings call even though it increased guidance and analyst EPS and revenue estimates. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs might have had a role to play in it, as we subtly alluded. Yet, if alternative products to its GPUs don't surface, which is likely given NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s substantial research and development experience, then the stock could do well in the future depending on the state of the AI industry. On the regulatory front, while media reports claim that the DOJ is interested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) for abusing its market position, the firm has denied receiving any subpoenas. For NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), investor expectations for its 2025 and 2026 revenue are also key for its hypothesis, as well as the need to maintain cost control as was evident after its third quarter results that saw shares drop by 6% after a disappointing beat and weaker margins.\n\nArtisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“NVIDIA’s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That’s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA’s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France.\n\nDoes this make any sense? We wish that we could definitively say that it doesn’t, given that we don’t own NVIDIA. But the answer is more complicated. The growth in revenue and profits at NVIDIA has been stunning. In the calendar year 2020, its revenue was about $17 billion. Estimates for 2024 are around $120 billion. Operating profit is projected to reach about $80 billion in 2024 versus $4.5 billion in 2020. NVIDIA’s revenue essentially represents the capital spending of a small number of very profitable, very cash-rich technology companies buying up the processors necessary to power artificial intelligence (AI) software programs. It’s an AI landgrab. In order for NVIDIA to sustain these levels of revenue or grow them from here, these AI investments must start to generate an ROI for those splashing out $120 billion a year. And if not generating an ROI in the near term, those companies must at least see the prospect of an ROI, a clear sustainable competitive advantage or a moat of some kind.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) the Best Stock Pick You Need to Know in Jim Cramer’s Latest Watchlist?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Watchlist: 10 Stock Picks You Need to Know. In this article, we will look at where Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands among other stock picks in Jim Cramer's latest watchlist.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto their stocks, anticipating a rebound after the market’s downturn. This advice proved useful as the Dow rose by 484 points or 1.16% and the NASDAQ also climbed by 1.16%, indicating that selling during the market decline was not the best choice.\n\n“Last week, I advised you to hold off on selling everything and just wait, as I believed that once the pain ended, we would see a rebound. The average investor saw gains, with the Dow up 484 points, or 1.16%, and the NASDAQ also climbing 1.16%. While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday’s downturn wasn’t the best strategy.”\n\nJim Cramer noted that the previous week was tough for economically sensitive and tech stocks, despite a mixed August employment report. This report suggested a balanced economic outlook, not too strong or weak, which initially seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, Wall Street reacted negatively, shifting away from cyclical stocks to more recession-proof sectors like consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, with industries such as industrials and semiconductors being particularly affected.\n\nCramer observed that recession-proof stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, have performed well recently but have seen significant gains, raising concerns about a potential correction.\n\n“Today, recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.”\n\nHe highlighted that historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it signals a shift in investment strategy. With the Fed expected to ease rates soon, Cramer suggests investors consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and look into more cyclical companies that could benefit from economic stimulus. While investing in cyclical stocks during a downturn is challenging, the anticipated rate cuts could make these stocks more attractive. Cramer advises maintaining diversification but being ready to adjust investment strategies based on the economic outlook.\n\n“Historically, when the Fed is about to start cutting rates, we know that it’s time to shift focus. With the Fed leaning towards easing and an expected rate cut next week, it’s time to consider moving away from recession-proof stocks and investing in more cyclical companies. While it’s challenging to buy cyclical stocks during a slowdown, anticipating that the Fed will boost the economy can make them strong investment opportunities. It’s important to maintain diversification but be ready to adjust as needed.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he talked about several stocks. From there, we picked ten companies and discussed how hedge funds are investing in them. Finally, we rank these companies from those least owned to those most owned by hedge funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 47\n\nJim Cramer comments on the recent volatility of Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), a partner of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). He notes that Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) dropped from $404 to $386 on Friday, impacted by a report from short-seller Hindenburg accusing the company of aggressive accounting practices. However, Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) rebounded to nearly $410 today. Cramer questions whether this rebound is significant or just a brief fluctuation, suggesting that the recent price movements might not provide clear insight into the company’s true performance.\n\n“How about this absurdity: Super Micro, fell from $404 to $386 on Friday, still hobbled by a report from short-seller Hindenburg about the company’s aggressive accounting. Then today, Super Micro bounced back to almost $410 again. Either the climb was meaningless, or the rebound is meaningless, or both are meaningless. We don’t know.”\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a strong investment option due to its significant growth in the AI and high-performance computing markets. Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has excelled in AI server infrastructure, driven by a rise in demand for AI applications. For fiscal year 2024, Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) reported a remarkable 143% increase in revenue, reaching $5.31 billion. Although net income grew by 82%, profit margins have narrowed as Super Micro Computer Inc.

(NASDAQ:SMCI) more appealing to investors by lowering its price per share. Despite facing competition from larger companies like Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) and dealing with margin pressures, Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)’s strong market presence and ambitious growth plans make it a promising long-term investment.\n\nPolen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The second largest contributor to the Portfolio’s relative performance was Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), a provider of high- performance, energy-efficient servers, which the Portfolio does not own. The stock declined notably in the quarter, providing a tailwind to relative performance. On a YTD basis, however, Super Micro is still our largest relative detractor, given its robust 1Q return.”\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 7th on our list. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock Recession-Proof? The Answer Might Surprise You.",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has gone from blowing away the stock market in the first half of the year to whipsawing back and forth on seemingly small news items.\n\nIt's unusual to see swings that amount to $200 billion in market value being added or taken away in just a single session. That's life for a stock worth nearly $3 trillion, though. Since Nvidia's stock hit an all-time high on June 20, it's moved up or down by 5% or more in 15 sessions, a reflection of the stock's own volatility and investor uncertainty around where Nvidia is heading.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) superstar has also shown itself to be particularly sensitive to macroeconomic data as well as bets about the direction of interest rates and the greater economy. For example, Nvidia stock jumped 4.5% on Aug. 23 when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the \"time had come\" to lower interest rates. On Sept. 6, the stock pulled back 4% on a weak unemployment report, sparking concerns about the economy, and it jumped 8% on Sept. 11 as a cooler-than-expected inflation report reinforced confidence in an interest rate cut next week.\n\nClearly, Nvidia is sensitive to the economy's direction, and fears of a recession have threatened the stock in recent months as the unemployment rate is rising and consumer demand is weak.\n\nSo, how would Nvidia fare in a recession? The answer is more complicated than you might think. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia and the economic cycle\n\nHistorically, the semiconductor sector is highly cyclical. Demand for chips goes through boom and bust cycles in line with the economy or a new kind of technology, and inventory can swing from a shortage to a glut quickly, influencing price and demand.\n\nThe broader semiconductor sector is just emerging from a downturn that was caused by oversupply of memory chips and others for the PC market as device sales boomed during the height of the pandemic and then pulled back.\n\nNvidia itself has gone through boom and bust cycles before. The stock soared during the pandemic as its chips were popular for crypto mining, but as Bitcoin prices plunged and tech stocks entered a bear market, Nvidia stock fell nearly 70% from its peak in 2021 to its trough in late 2022.\n\nThe stock went through a similar cycle in 2018 and 2019, falling nearly 60%.\n\nWhy this time could be different\n\nNvidia has put up unprecedented results in recent quarters with revenue more than tripling over four quarters, and profits soaring by as Nvidia's profit margins have expanded to greater than 60%.\n\nIts components, which are powering the AI revolution, are in demand from virtually every cloud infrastructure company and AI start-up. Alphabet co-founder Larry Page reportedly said he was willing to bankrupt the company to win the AI race, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also tipped his cap to Nvidia, saying it was vital for the company to maintain its supply of Nvidia GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, demand for Nvidia's products is so strong and the companies buying them are so rich that the business should do fine in a recession -- it seems like it would take a severe economic crash to pause the AI race.\n\nEven Nvidia's own CEO, Jensen Huang, acknowledged this dynamic at a recent investor conference. Huang was asked at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference what he was most worried about. Most CEOs would probably say competition, macroeconomics, innovation, or something to that effect. Instead of discussing potential threats to Nvidia, he went in the opposite direction, saying:\n\nWe have a lot of people on our shoulders, and everybody is counting on us. Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people because it directly affects their revenues. It directly affects their competitiveness.\n\nRather than worry about demand as most CEOs might, Nvidia has the opposite problem. It's still struggling to meet overwhelming demand for its components nearly two years after the launch of ChatGPT. Huang is worried about pleasing his customers and the pressure on his company to deliver as Nvidia products have become so precious because the stakes are so high in the AI race.\n\nWhat it means for Nvidia stock\n\nDespite the business's strong position, investors aren't treating Nvidia any differently from a typical semiconductor stock. Based on its price action, they continue to believe that it's highly sensitive to the macro-level economy and a possible recession, but that doesn't seem true of the business right now given the imbalance between supply and demand, the company's soaring revenue growth, and comments from top CEOs like Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, who have said that the risk of underinvesting in AI is much greater than overinvesting.\n\nInvestors can't control whether Nvidia falls on downbeat economic news, but they can do something else: Take advantage of the misalignment between the strength of the business and the volatility in the stock and buy the dip in Nvidia if it pulls back on recession fears.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) an Unstoppable Growth Stock To Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Unstoppable Growth Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands among the unstoppable growth stocks to buy now.\n\nShould You Invest in Growth Stocks with Rate Cuts Around the Corner?\n\nGrowth stocks are shares in a company whose earnings and sales are growing faster than other companies and are expected to continue to grow. These stocks rarely pay dividends as management is eager to reinvest earnings to fuel further growth.\n\nHowever, with higher growth potential comes high risks. Moreover, it is challenging to find hidden growth stocks as they are typically new companies that are constantly seeking the next big innovation. We recently covered the 10 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, which talks about various approaches used to identify these stocks. Here’s an excerpt from the piece:\n\nWhen it comes to identifying growth stocks, there are several approaches that are followed. These depend on the business model and the fundamentals of the firms being analyzed. For instance, for profitable companies with a positive net income, the price to earnings ratio is used. However, a large portion of high growth stocks aren’t profitable as they reinvest their revenue into expanding market share. This leads to high operating costs, and these firms are valued either through the EV/Sales or EV/EBITDA ratios, depending on whether the firm generates a positive operating income or not.\n\nBoth the P/E and other ratios tell us the premium that the market is placing over a firm’s ability to generate money. For instance, one of the major semiconductor companies in the world, which ranks 6th on our list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News, had a P/E ratio of 112x by the end of Q1 2018. This was before the age of AI, and its two peers in the chip industry had 37x for the chip stock that’s Wall Street’s AI darling and 19x for the struggling American chip giant that’s also the only leading edge US based chip manufacturer. Safe to say, the 112x P/E foretold the story of times to come, and since Q1 2018, the stock has gained a whopping 1,386%.\n\nThe recent slowing down of the macroeconomic environment and the hype of return on investment of artificial intelligence have questioned the viability of investment in growth stocks. Analysts and portfolio managers have variable opinions but they all converge to a single point “diversification”.\n\nOn August 15, Ben Snider from Goldman Sachs appeared in a CNBC interview and mentioned that he still prefers growth stocks over value stocks but emphasized on diversified portfolios. He pointed out that the base case is not the economy running into recession, it is quite the opposite as the data suggests. Ben Snider believes that the economy continues to grow and backed his arguments by mentioning the second quarter earnings season growth, the S&P 500 growth, and the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Therefore the base case as per Snider is higher equity prices by the year end.\n\nWhile elaborating on his statement about growth stocks, Ben Snider pointed out that an environment of slowing but healthy economic growth along with falling interest rates have historically supported growth stocks over value stocks.\n\nMost importantly, Snider emphasized that there is a risk for some extremely large stocks both from a positioning point of view and from their inability to maintain very strong rates of growth. In addition, the AI bubble problem along with very high analyst expectations have priced these stocks to an extremely overvalued situation.\n\nThe solution, as presented by Snider, is to adopt a more diversified approach and go for a selection of smaller tech stocks along with other high-growth industries. Some of the major growth industries mentioned during the interview were smaller tech stocks, the healthcare industry, and some other European stocks that are on the verge of cutting-edge innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 7 unstoppable growth stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We set the performance filter to year-to-date +50% gain and sifted through some of the high-growth industries to get a consolidated list of stocks. We then selected the highest gainers that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the year-to-date performance of stocks.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) an Unstoppable Growth Stocks To Buy Now?\n\nA financial advisor wearing a suit, pointing to a graph demonstrating success and growth in the financial sector.\n\nMicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)\n\nYear-to-date Share Price Gain as of September 11: 89.20%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) originally operates in the software technology industry and generates revenue from designing, developing, and selling artificial intelligence-powered business intelligence software solutions. The company enters into licensing agreements and also offers cloud subscriptions and other related services. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) software platforms and services have gained traction due to their ability to turn complex business data into rich, reliable, and actionable information. Its flagship, MicroStrategy ONE AI-powered business intelligence platform is being used by some of the biggest organizations in the world, including Bayer, U.S. Department of State, and Lori. As a result of increased appreciation of its MicroStrategy ONE, management has shifted its focus towards its cloud offering. The cloud subscription revenue alone increased 21% year-over-year amounting to $24 million in Q2 2024. However, the overall revenue of the company declined 7% during the same time due to the transition from upfront product license revenues to subscription services revenues. Thereby, staying in line with management expectations. One of the recent key developments for its subscription-based revenue came in on August 8, when the company announced its MicroStrategy ONE for Government availability on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This new marketplace listing will not only strengthen MicroStrategy Incorporated's (NASDAQ:MSTR) partnership with AWS but will also increase its subscription revenue. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) has a unique way of using its free cash flows, which puts it ahead of its competition. The company began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 and since then it has gone on to become one of the world’s first bitcoin development companies. As of July 31st, it had 226,500 Bitcoins worth more than $15 billion. The strategy has worked well for the software specialist as its BTC Yield has reached 12.2% on a year-to-date basis. Management is aiming for a 4% to 8% annual yield for the next three years and plans to leverage it for operational flexibility. MSTR has soared 89.20% on a year-to-date basis, making it one of the unstoppable growth stocks to buy now. It was held by 26 hedge funds in Q2 2024, with total positions worth $442.24 million. Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder with a position worth $1.9 billion Artisan Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Regarding MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), our decision to avoid this company comes down to a lack of conviction in its franchise characteristics. The stock has worked this year due to a rebound in the price of bitcoin. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has been focused on converting its cash and cash equivalent holdings, as well as issuing debt, to fund the purchase of bitcoin, which now makes up most of the company’s value.”\n\nOverall MSTR ranks 7th on our list of the unstoppable tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE:DELL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer thinks deserve attention.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advised investors to hold off on selling stocks, anticipating a rebound once the market’s downturn ended.

While it might not be a full recovery, it shows that selling into Friday’s downturn wasn’t the best strategy.”\n\nThe previous week was challenging for economically sensitive stocks and tech stocks, despite the August employment report showing modest growth and a downward revision for July. The recent report seemed favorable for those hoping for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as it presented a balanced scenario of neither too strong nor too weak.

Industrials and semiconductors were particularly affected.\n\nJim Cramer observed that on Monday, recession-proof stocks such as pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform strongly. However, this trend is concerning as these stocks have surged significantly and might be due for a correction.\n\n“Recession-proof stocks like pharmaceuticals, drug wholesalers, and medical devices continued to perform well, which is dangerous as these stocks have seen parabolic gains and could be due for a correction.”\n\nAccording to Cramer, historically, when the Federal Reserve is about to cut rates, it’s a signal to shift investment strategies. With the Fed moving towards easing and a rate cut expected next week, Cramer suggests it’s time to reconsider holding recession-proof stocks.

(NYSE:DELL) is positioned for long-term growth, with strong performance in AI-related sectors driving its bullish outlook. In Q2 2024, Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) reported $22.9 billion in revenue, thanks largely to a 10% growth in its Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which benefited from increasing demand for AI-optimized servers.

Does Jim Cramer Think NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)) Stock Deserves Your Attention?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer questioned whether artificial intelligence is still a hot topic, given recent trading patterns. He pointed out that stocks associated with AI, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a key player in the AI space and a name in his investment club—have dropped nearly 14% over the past five sessions. This decline raises doubts about current investor interest in AI-related investments.\n\n“Does anyone care about artificial intelligence anymore? Seems fair to ask considering the recent trading in stocks lumped into the AI trade, including key enabler and fellow Club name Nvidia, which is down almost 14% in the past five sessions.”\n\nA positive outlook on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is supported by its impressive financial performance and leadership in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. In Q2 FY2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s revenue surged 122% year-over-year to $30 billion, with net income increasing 168% to $16.6 billion. This growth was driven mainly by a 154% rise in data center revenue, reaching $26.3 billion, due to high demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s advanced Hopper GPUs used in AI applications.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s leadership in AI is further highlighted by its upcoming Blackwell architecture, expected to boost revenue even more. The gaming segment also performed well, with a 16% revenue increase to $2.9 billion, thanks to the versatility of its RTX GPUs, which are used for both gaming and AI tasks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s commitment to returning value to shareholders is clear with its $50 billion share repurchase program, showing strong confidence in future growth.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving.\n\nThe reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer Thinks These 10 Stocks Deserve Your Attention. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other beginner stocks.\n\nOn one hand, some investors view the status quo as a bear market, and on the other, some analysts hold a bullish view. While caution is necessary, blue chip stocks with historically solid results have an edge in the risk department.\n\nThe Status Quo Calls for Safer Investing\n\nGeopolitical tensions on the one hand and economic turmoil on the other, have created a concerning situation for investors. On September 3, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to share his outlook of the market. Lee is particularly concerned about the job market, the surprise inflation has in store for the economy, and weak growth projections.\n\nLee emphasized that investors must remain cautious for the next eight weeks or so, especially with elections and rate cuts, he predicts that the general public is bound to be nervous and confused. While his timeline may not be exact, he expects economic conditions and political turmoil to settle within the suggested time frame.\n\nHe further added that it is safer to be cautious than to make hasty decisions at the moment. He also stated that the oil industry is particularly weak due to geopolitical tensions despite a massive rise in production. Lee added that increasing production levels does not indicate a booming global economy, because, previously, production increased only because prices were rising which led to more drilling and activity in the sector.\n\nLee recommended that investors will be able to buy long, and therefore it is best to remain cautious. He further added that we already had 7% corrections twice this year, and there is a possibility of another 7% to 10% correction in the market. He did agree that the market is currently testing investors' patience and he predicts something close to a 5% pullback.\n\nHow Must Investors Navigate Moving Forward?\n\nOn September 6, Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss how investors should navigate the market right now. Sonders held a particularly bullish view of the market. She further added that while there has been significant weakness and churn on the surface, it is concealed by cap-weighted index returns.\n\nSonders suggested that the market level declines were most likely a set-up for the broadening out we have witnessed. She shared her point of view on the market, which is rather bullish, and emphasized that stocks in the consumer discretionary, technology, and communication services sectors are doing particularly well. Sonders, however, did point out that the market may see an exhaustion in the mega-cap tech trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe then suggests that investors must let go of the perception that to succeed they must invest in mega-cap tech stocks. She states that there are a myriad of opportunities outside of the mega-cap tech that are high quality. Finally, Sonders believes that a recession is not on the cards and that the current situation is nothing more than a growth scare.\n\nNow that we have assessed the market, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts. You can also take a look at the best defensive stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts we sifted over multiple similar rankings and ETFs to come up with safe and blue chip stocks. The rationale behind this was that investors with little money don't afford to lose a lot and are more likely to invest in stocks that are safer or risk-free. We then sorted our stocks based on their upside potential. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAnalyst Upside as of September 10: 42%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Folders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most popular stocks at the moment, also referred to as the AI star. The GPU maker is known for its cloud solutions, chip systems, and growing role in producing artificial intelligence solutions.\n\nThe company's Advanced AI platform for Enterprise improves productivity, streamlines AI workflows, and ensures faster deployment and processing of AI. Its networking platform for AI, Spectrum X, is projected to become a multi-billion dollar entity in a year. Moreover, earlier this year, the company introduced its Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU), backed by six different technologies. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects to ramp production of Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter and ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Currently, the demand for its GPUs exceeds the supply.\n\nOverall, the company logged $ 26.3 billion in data center revenue, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% year-over-year. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for Nvidia's GPU Computing platform. Compute revenue grew by 2.5x and networking revenue expanded by 2x compared to the previous year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) logged $30 billion in revenue during the FQ2 of 2025, up by 122% year-over-year, well above its outlook of only $28 billion.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on NVDA and their 12-month median price target of $150 points to a 42% upside from current levels. At the close of Q2 2024, 179 investors were bullish on NVDA, with total stakes amounting to $53.7 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $18.35 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanleyand Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Nvidia's Bubble About to Burst? 3 Numbers That Have Me Thinking It Just Might Be.",
        "content": "One of the most important dates in modern history is Nov. 30, 2022 -- the day that OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public. It didn't take long for people all over the world to become totally enamored by the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nPerhaps no company has benefited as much from the AI revolution as semiconductor and data center specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the commercial launch of ChatGPT about two years ago, shares of Nvidia are up by more than 700%.\n\nNvidia has completely dominated the high-performance computing market, largely through its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPU). However, three trends visible in the company's latest earnings report have me concerned that the euphoric bubble surrounding Nvidia might be about to burst.\n\n1. Revenue and profit growth are slowing down\n\nNvidia reports its revenue in five different categories, but the vast majority of its sales now come from its data center business. Within the data center category, Nvidia bifurcates its revenue into two further sub-categories: compute and networking.\n\nFor the last two years, sales from compute and networking have been off the charts, consistently clocking triple-digit percentage growth as demand for Nvidia's GPUs remained robust. A couple of weeks ago, Nvidia reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter, which ended July 28. The company's total quarterly revenue of $30 billion set a new record, as did its data center total of $26.3 billion.\n\nWhile these figures might make Nvidia look unstoppable, the underlying trends suggest otherwise. The table below breaks down Nvidia's annual and sequential growth rates for total revenue and data center revenue over the last five quarters.\n\nMetric Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Q2 2025 Total revenue growth (YoY) 101% 206% 265% 262% 122% Total revenue growth (QoQ) 88% 34% 22% 18% 15% Data center revenue growth (YoY) 171% 279% 409% 427% 154% Data center revenue growth (QoQ) 141% 41% 27% 23% 16%\n\nData source: Nvidia. YOY = year over year. QoQ = quarter over quarter.\n\nIt's hard to criticize a company that is growing as fast as Nvidia is. What I'm concerned about isn't its ability to create demand, but the pace at which this demand occurs. Sales in the data center business -- and by extension, Nvidia's entire sales base -- are starting to show signs of deceleration. Some of this can be chalked up to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry broadly, while some of the sales trends can be attributed to ongoing bottlenecks in Nvidia's supply chain.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, I am a bit wary of a slowing sales pace. Moreover, further analysis suggests that where Nvidia's growth comes from could be an even larger issue.\n\n2. Customer concentration is becoming more apparent\n\nLooking at top-line figures alone doesn't help much in determining the health of a business. A more useful stat to analyze is customer concentration. This reflects how diversified a company's sales base is.\n\nAlthough Nvidia sells its GPUs around the globe, analysis of the company's financial reports suggests that the business has become heavily concentrated. In fiscal 2025's second quarter, almost half of Nvidia's $30 billion in revenues came from just four customers. This level of concentration isn't really anything new, and I see rising competition as a big reason Nvidia's sales deceleration could be further exacerbated.\n\nWhile Nvidia faces direct competition from Advanced Micro Devices, the company is also beginning to witness a surge in competition from tangential sources such as Microsoft, Tesla, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.\n\nMany of these \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are large buyers of Nvidia's tech. However, based on remarks from executives at these various megacaps, many of these companies are looking to reduce their dependence on Nvidia and actually design their own chips that compete directly with its tech.\n\nEven when that competition begins to take shape, I think Nvidia will have little problem finding new buyers. But with rising competition comes another issue: a loss of pricing power. As more AI-capable GPUs become widely available -- possibly to the point of becoming commoditized hardware -- it's likely that Nvidia will not be able to command such high prices for its chips.\n\nThese dynamics lead me to my final, and most significant, concern about Nvidia's outlook. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. The most important metric: gross margin\n\nWith its existing pricing power, Nvidia has steadily commanded strong margins. However, the company's latest earnings report revealed a notable drop in gross margin. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nI wouldn't fret too much about a single quarter's decelerating margin profile, but the larger implications here are tough to ignore.\n\nIf margins continue to deteriorate amid a backdrop of rising competition, Nvidia's bottom line could be significantly impacted. Its free cash flow and profitability would begin to shrink, leaving it with less capacity to invest in research and development, marketing, and other innovation areas or growth tactics.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The CEO of Nvidia Just Sold $78 Million Worth of His Company's Stock. Here's What Investors Need to Know.",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock sent investors on a wild ride so far in 2024. It was trading at a stock split-adjusted price of around $48 at the start of the year. The price got as high as $140.76 at one point in mid-June, then plunged to $99 by early August before recovering enough to trade around $130 a share by mid-August. It then fell 21% over a few weeks to trade around $103 in early September before recovering somewhat this past week, and it now trades around $118.\n\nWhew. A wild ride indeed.\n\nIt's somewhat understandable, of course. As the focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Nvidia carries a lot on its shoulders, and expectations are sky-high for this tech stock. Even after beating consensus estimates in its last earnings report, the stock price still slipped. Apparently, Wall Street felt it didn't beat their estimates by enough. While the stock's price trajectory is currently on the upswing, investors are hyper-tuned to its performance and any indication of where it may be headed.\n\nIt might interest investors, then, that Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has been selling some of his Nvidia holdings. In the last month alone, Huang sold 720,000 shares totaling about $78 million.\n\nWhat does it mean that Nvidia's chief is offloading shares?\n\nThis latest sale isn't his first cashing in on shares. Since just the start of July, Huang has sold over 4 million shares worth roughly $500 million. At first glance, this might be seen as a sign that the person who knows the business the most intimately thinks the stock price is going to drop (or that there's trouble ahead). But a more thorough analysis shows it's not. Although I can't know Huang's exact thinking, there's no reason to take these sales as a cause for worry.\n\nThe simpler explanation comes down to the cost of living. The vast majority of Huang's net worth is tied up in Nvidia stock. Unfortunately, you can't buy a hamburger (or a super yacht) with stock -- at least not easily. Cash is king, as they say. It is far more likely that Huang is simply liquifying a tiny portion of his massive net worth -- valued at around $100 billion today -- to have some cash on hand.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rules around executives buying and selling their own company's stock. To avoid any suspicion of insider trading (as well as tamp down potential transaction-related public panic), SEC rule 10b5-1 allows executives to release public plans that outline predetermined, automated stock transactions handled by a neutral entity. While it may look like Huang just sold this stock, he actually decided to do so months ago and did it in a way that suggests he had very little influence on the price.\n\nStory continues\n\nTracking insider trading can be interesting, but most of the time it means a lot less than it might first seem to.\n\nNvidia is steaming ahead\n\nAs far as Nvidia's future stock performance, the path ahead has gotten far more complicated, but I still think it's in a strong position. The company's latest quarterly earnings report showed continued growth -- it more than doubled its revenue year over year. The thing investors have to remember is that the major inflection point for Nvidia was the second quarter of last year, so it's natural that the year-over-year growth has cooled a bit from the 200%-plus growth we saw in the last three quarters. Just look at the revenue explode in 2023 in this chart below. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhile there was some concern that Nvidia could keep the growth going, many of the fears people had didn't materialize. Concern over a delay in Nvidia shipping its latest generation of superchips was overblown, and demand for its current generation remains extremely strong. Rising concerns around a lack of real-world value for AI potentially hurting Nvidia's clients and reducing their spending has also not yet happened. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are still locked in an AI arms race, and most are expecting to increase their spending, not reduce it.\n\nMore customers may be around the corner, too. Though Nvidia's data center revenue is highly concentrated in big tech, we could soon see a broader set of commercial clients and even governments begin to invest in earnest. This would be a boon for Nvidia. Government-related contracts can be an extremely lucrative source of revenue and one that is slow to change once the relationship is formalized, providing an additional level of stability.\n\nFinally, the company's push into the automotive industry is only just ramping up. In the short term, AI-powered infotainment and safety features will drive revenue, but further on the horizon lies the real prize: Self-driving cars.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Incredibly Cheap but Fast-Growing Semiconductor Stock Could Outperform Nvidia",
        "content": "There is no denying that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top semiconductor stocks on the market in 2024, with stunning gains of 118% as of this writing. However, the recent stock price action indicates that investor confidence in this high-flying company is now wavering.\n\nThe past two-and-a-half months have been quite volatile for Nvidia investors, with the stock pulling back significantly. Moreover, it was surprising to see that the chip specialist's latest quarterly report couldn't turn investors' sentiment in its favor despite better-than-expected numbers and healthy guidance for the current quarter.\n\nOne reason that may be the case is that Nvidia's stunning surge since the beginning of 2023 has made it very expensive from a valuation perspective. The semiconductor stock has jumped a whopping 639% since the beginning of last year. Though it has justified this red-hot rally with outstanding growth quarter after quarter, it still trades at 27 times sales and 50 times trailing earnings.\n\nOf course, Nvidia can justify its valuation with impressive growth in the coming quarters. However, valuation-led concerns could weigh on the stock. That's why investors would do well to take a closer look at another semiconductor company that's not only substantially cheaper than Nvidia but is also witnessing a nice acceleration in growth.\n\nThis semiconductor company is growing at a healthy clip\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), generally known as TSMC, has enjoyed healthy gains of 56% on the stock market this year. Of course, while TSMC's gains are nowhere near Nvidia's, there is a good chance that the Taiwan-based foundry giant may upstage its more illustrious peer in the future.\n\nThat's because TSMC's growth has picked up nicely of late. The company recently reported its August sales figures and delivered a 33% year-over-year increase in revenue. It is also worth noting that TSMC's revenue in the first eight months of 2024 increased by almost 31% from the same period last year. At this pace, TSMC is well on track to exceed the 26% revenue growth to $87.5 billion analysts are expecting it to deliver in 2024.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is expected to deliver a 125% increase in revenue in the current fiscal year. But if we look at their revenue estimates a couple of fiscal years ahead, Nvidia and TSMC are expected to clock a similar growth rate of 17%. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe good thing about TSMC is that even if it hits almost $130 billion in revenue after a couple of years, it will still be in a nice position to keep delivering an impressive revenue growth rate. That's because TSMC now sees a larger addressable market ahead instead of just the foundry business, which it says was worth around $115 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder its Foundry 2.0 plan, TSMC is now targeting a much larger market that includes chip packaging, testing, and integrated device manufacturing (IDM). TSMC believes its overall addressable market now stands at $250 billion. TSMC's 2023 revenue now stood at just over $69 billion, which means it enjoyed a 60% share of the foundry market last year.\n\nAssuming it can corner a similar share of the additional revenue opportunity, its annual revenue has the potential to hit $150 billion in the future (based on the $250 billion market size discussed above). The good part is that TSMC is taking steps to ensure it can capture a bigger share of the end-market opportunity by way of capacity expansion.\n\nFor instance, TSMC's foundry market share increased by 150 basis points year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to 61.7%. The company is expected to increase its capital expenditure (capex) by 12% to 14% in 2025 to $32 billion to $36 billion. Moreover, TSMC's advanced packaging capacity is estimated to increase by 60% per year through 2026 so that it can manufacture more AI chips.\n\nSo, there is a strong possibility of TSMC's market share improving further in the future, which could allow it to capture a bigger share of the $250 billion addressable market and lead to robust long-term growth.\n\nWhy TSMC could outperform Nvidia\n\nAnalysts are expecting TSMC's earnings to increase at an annual pace of 21.5% for the next five years, which is lower than Nvidia's estimated annual earnings growth of 52% over the same period. Assuming TSMC indeed manages to clock such growth over the next five years, its bottom line could jump to almost $17 per share after five years (using 2024's estimated earnings of $6.55 per share as the base).\n\nTSMC has a forward earnings multiple of just 20. A similar multiple after five years would translate into a stock price of $340, assuming it indeed hits $17 per share in earnings. That would represent a 114% increase from current levels in five years. But it is worth noting that TSMC's earnings multiple is much lower than the Nasdaq-100 index's average of 29. So, if the market decides to reward the stock with a richer valuation, it could deliver even more upside over the next five years.\n\nOn the other hand, if Nvidia indeed clocks 52% earnings growth, its bottom line could hit $9.65 per share after five years (using fiscal 2025's projected earnings of $2.84 per share as the base). Nvidia trades at a relatively expensive 37 times forward earnings when compared to TSMC. That rich valuation is the reason Wall Street has been skeptical about the company's ability to deliver more upside.\n\nAssuming even Nvidia trades at a discounted 20 times forward earnings after five years, its stock price could hit $193, based on the projected earnings calculated above. That would be a 79% increase from current levels, indicating that TSMC indeed has the potential to deliver stronger gains than Nvidia in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 3 Phenomenal Stocks Are Set to Soar",
        "content": "No one knows for sure how any stock will perform over the next 12 months. There are simply too many variables that can come into play.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that analysts and investors can't have pretty good hunches about what certain stocks will do over the near term. And they can certainly have a reasonable idea about how some stocks will perform over the long term. With these two premises in mind, I'll make a prediction: These three phenomenal stocks are set to soar.\n\n1. D.R. Horton\n\nD.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) stock is already a big winner in 2024. I think the homebuilder's shares will jump even more for three key reasons.\n\nMost importantly, the U.S. still faces a major housing shortage. Zillow recently estimated that the country has a deficit of 4.5 million homes. As the largest homebuilder by volume in the U.S. for more than two decades, D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to benefit as this shortage is addressed.\n\nWhile the housing shortage should provide a long-term tailwind for D.R. Horton, the stock could move higher over the short term if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. Many observers expect the Fed to cut rates by at least 0.25% later this month and potentially follow up with further cuts. Lower interest rates usually lead to lower mortgage rates, which should boost home sales.\n\nMy third reason for being bullish about D.R. Horton is its valuation. Shares currently trade below 12 times forward earnings with a five-year price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.62. Simply put, D.R. Horton is dirt cheap considering its strong growth prospects.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIf you see a glass of water as half-full, you'll probably focus on the fact that Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) share price has skyrocketed this year. If you see a glass of water as half-empty, you might correctly point out that the stock has pulled back quite a bit from its peak. My view, though, is that more water will soon be poured into Nvidia's glass.\n\nI'm referring to the upcoming commercial launch of Nvidia's graphics  processing units (GPUs) based on its Blackwell architecture. This GPU platform supports up to 25 times lower costs and energy consumption than the company's market-leading chips that use its Hopper architecture.\n\nSure, Nvidia has delayed shipping its Blackwell chips. However, CEO Jensen Huang expects the new GPUs will rake in \"billions of dollars\" in 2024. He also thinks that Blackwell could be the \"most successful\" product in Nvidia's history and possibly in the entire computer industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaybe Huang is overly optimistic; maybe he's not. Either way, I suspect the launch of Blackwell will enable Nvidia to set new all-time highs in the not-too-distant future. And with the company now on a one-year cycle of new product roll-outs, Blackwell should be only the beginning.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) has racked up the smallest gains of these three phenomenal stocks so far this year, but it's still up by a double-digit percentage. I believe the biotech stock will soon shift into a higher gear.\n\nThe commercial launch of Casgevy, the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy to win regulatory approval, is only in the early stages of ramping up. William Blair analyst Myles Minter projects Casgevy will achieve peak-annual sales of at least $3 billion.\n\nThere's even better news for Vertex, though. The company expects regulatory approvals of suzetrigine in treating acute pain and its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo in treating cystic fibrosis by early 2025. Suzetrigine should have tremendous market potential as a non-opioid that's safe and effective at alleviating pain. I predict that the vanzacaftor triple will become Vertex's best-selling CF therapy yet.\n\nVertex's pipeline features two other promising drugs in late-stage development. Inaxaplin targets APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which affects more patients worldwide than CF. Povetacicept is in phase 3 testing for treating IgA nephropathy, an inflammatory kidney disease. I think both could become blockbuster drugs for Vertex if approved.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SMCI, NVDA, or AMD: Which Chip Stock Is the Best Investment?",
        "content": "Advanced computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are arguably the most hyped technologies at the moment, making investment decisions in this area challenging. This article compares three major players—Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA)—using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool. I’ll explain why Nvidia, which I currently rate a Buy, is the best option for investors, while I maintain a Hold stance on both Super Micro Computer and AMD.\n\nBefore comparing these stocks, it’s important to understand each company’s role. NVIDIA and AMD provide graphics processing units (GPUs) used in servers and data centers, many of which are built by Super Micro Computer. While NVIDIA and AMD focus on accelerating computations, Super Micro supplies the needed infrastructure.\n\nLet’s dive into the details.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nFrom a growth perspective, Super Micro Computer is a strong investment, although I currently rate the stock a Hold. The company’s revenues surged 109.7% over the last 12 months, and its earnings increased 63.9% during the same period, driven by strong AI demand.\n\nAnalysts expect Super Micro’s revenue to grow by 88.3% this year, potentially reaching $28.14 billion. However, the company is facing challenges due to a recent report by Hindenburg Research, a notorious short seller, that has leveled claims of accounting manipulation at the company. This has led to a sharp decline in the share price and raised concerns about the company’s management team. Shortly after the Hindenburg report was made public, Super Micro Computer delayed releasing its annual report.\n\nIs SMCI A Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nThe current situation at Super Micro Computer makes it a risky investment, which is largely why I rate the stock a Hold. On the other hand, the stock, currently trading at $465, down from a peak of $1,229 reached in March of this year, could present a buy-the-dip opportunity if the allegations against the company are proven to be unfounded.\n\nLooking at momentum indicators, the stock is currently below its 10, 50, and 100-day moving averages, signaling short- and medium-term bearish momentum. However, trading below the 200-day average may signal an oversold condition, potentially offering a chance for contrarian investors.\n\nDespite recent downgrades from four analysts, Wall Street remains optimistic about SMCI, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average SMCI price target from 11 analysts is $978.50, implying a potential upside of 119.69%.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia is a standout technology concern and dominant in the AI field, which is why I rate the stock a Buy. The company’s powerful chips are critical for advanced AI systems and data centers, and it controls about 98% of the data-center GPU market. This impressive market dominance, and positive earnings growth, reinforce my bullish stance on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the past 12 months, Nvidia’s revenues have surged 194.7%, with earnings soaring 394.2%. Analysts expect the company to grow its revenue by 106.1% this year, reaching $125.58 billion, and anticipate a 119.2% increase in earnings per share (EPS). While Nvidia’s recent second-quarter financial results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations with 122% year-over-year sales growth and positive guidance, it fell short of the exceptionally high growth seen in previous quarters when sales rose more than 200% year-over-year.\n\nIs NVDA A Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nNVDA stock is definitely a Buy. It seems foolish to bet against this leading chipmaker, given the 140% gain in its share price this year. While recent results have raised concerns about slowing growth, I believe the long-term outlook for Nvidia remains strong.\n\nHowever, investors should expect some short-term volatility in Nvidia’s stock due to its big run. Technical indicators show bearish trends in the short and medium term, though long-term indicators remain bullish. This suggests that, despite potential short-term weaknesses, long-term investors in Nvidia are likely to profit.\n\nWall Street remains extremely bullish on Nvidia. Among 42 analysts, 39 hold a Buy rating on the stock, with an average NVDA price target of $153.24, implying 31.08% upside from current levels.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nMy Hold rating on AMD is due to the company’s unimpressive financial growth. While the company posted a 6.4% increase in revenue and a 30.5% rise in earnings over the last 12 months, this growth pales in comparison to that of its main rival, Nvidia. This relative underperformance is driven by AMD’s continued focus on hardware efficiency.\n\nAnalysts forecast a nearly 13% increase in revenue for AMD this year, reaching $25.62 billion, along with a 27.6% rise in EPS. While the outlook is strong, AMD’s recent results have been disappointing. Despite a 115% year-over-year revenue increase in the company’s Data Center segment during Q2, AMD’s revenue from chips and processors used in video game consoles fell by 59% to $648 million. In contrast, Nvidia’s gaming revenues increased by 16% year-over-year. This performance gap suggests that AMD might not be the most attractive microchip designer to invest in right now.\n\nIs AMD a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nAnother reason I rate AMD stock a Hold is the company’s recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems. This deal, financed with 75% cash and 25% stock, has raised concerns about potential share dilution, which could impact annual earnings. So far this year, AMD stock has risen less than 10%, trailing most of its peers and the technology-laden Nasdaq index, which has gained 20% year-to-date.\n\nIn terms of momentum indicators, short-term signals are currently a Buy, while medium- and long-term indicators suggest a Sell. This implies that, while there may be short-term gains, long-term investors should exercise caution due to bearish sentiment.\n\nOn a positive note, Wall Street’s consensus remains a Strong Buy for AMD stock. Of the 32 analysts covering AMD, 26 recommend a Buy, and the average price target of $190.25 indicates potential upside of 26.95%.\n\nConclusion – NVDA Is the Best Investment\n\nWhile each company—Super Micro Computer, Nvidia, and AMD—has individual strengths, Nvidia currently offers the most compelling investment opportunity due to its dominance in AI and impressive growth. Super Micro Computer and AMD should be viewed with caution, given some underlying issues at each company. Assessing all three chip stocks, Nvidia holds a clear advantage in both performance and market outlook.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Nvidia's huge stock rally is still exerting an outsized influence over the S&P 500 index , reinforcing concerns that broader markets could be hurt if the chipmaking giant's fortunes turn.\n\nThis year's 140% surge in shares of Nvidia, whose chips are seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence applications, has accounted for about a quarter of the S&P 500's 17% gain.\n\nNvidia showed its powerful hold over Wall Street on Wednesday, when the stock's 8.2% rally helped drive the S&P 500 to its biggest intraday upswing in nearly two years. The index reversed a 1.6% loss to end the day up 1.1%.\n\nNvidia jumped after CEO Jensen Huang flagged strong demand for the company's chips, boosting its market value by more than $200 billion and accounting for 44% of the S&P 500's surge that day, data from Nomura showed.\n\nNvidia's rally \"got the whole market moving,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.\n\nThe S&P 500 has struggled to make headway this year on Nvidia's down days, eking out gains only 13% of the time when the chipmaker's shares have closed weaker, a Reuters analysis showed.\n\nThis year, the index has failed to rise more than 1% on any day when Nvidia's shares ended lower. In 2020, there were 13 such instances.\n\nFor many investors, the recent moves revived worries over a small cohort of stocks dictating the market's direction.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple and Nvidia have a combined weighting of nearly 20% in the S&P 500, though shares of the first two have gained far less this year than Nvidia's.\n\nWhile recent strength in non-tech sectors has stirred hopes of a broadening rally, a sustained sell-off in any of the tech megacaps could still badly hurt broader markets, analysts said.\n\n\"If Nvidia is weak because demand for their product goes down then that's going to tank the whole market,\" said Susquehanna's Murphy.\n\nOPTIONS BOOST\n\nTraders are keeping a close eye on Nvidia's options, which have played a major role in boosting recent moves.\n\nNvidia recently accounted for about 22% of the overall volume of individual stock options traded daily, up from around 5% at the start of the year, making it the most actively traded stock in the options market on most days, Trade Alert data showed.\n\nNvidia's gains are amplified when traders rush into upside call options. When buying of these options surges, market makers who sell these contracts are on the hook to buy and deliver more Nvidia shares at the agreed price, leaving them \"short gamma,\" in options parlance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe additional purchases to cover risk lift the stock even higher.\n\n\"You do see the market keen to buy upside calls when it's working,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at online broker Pepperstone. \"When it's hot, these flows absolutely make a difference.\"\n\nNvidia is not the first stock to have such a powerful sway over the rest of the market.\n\nTesla, another favorite of nonprofessional traders, displayed similar characteristics a few years ago when the options market amplified the electric vehicle maker's stock swings, Nomura strategist Charlie McElligott said.\n\nBut AI seems to have stirred the imagination of investors even more than EVs.\n\n\"The mania that is the actual paradigm shift which AI represents across the corporate landscape, is just making it a magnitudes-larger theme,\" he said. \"Tesla was never close to that.\"\n\n\"AI is just its own animal,\" McElligott said.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)",

        "title": "What AI Bubble? NVIDIA &amp; 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside",
        "content": "Of late, the stock market has wavered, with tech stocks underperforming in July and August. The euphoria about the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution faded following the post-earnings decline in shares of prominent chipmakers, leaving Wall Street without a major driver.\n\nChip stocks tanked from a mid-July high as their stretched valuations raised doubts about their capability to sustain real revenue growth, which resembles the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nHowever, the AI boom is here to stay and will drive the prices of chip stocks northward. In reality, chip stocks have now begun to gain ground by banking on the strength of AI. Thus, it’s prudent for investors to keep an eye on chip stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, which display a strong price upside and increase shareholders’ wealth.\n\nAI is Not in a Bubble Like Dot Com\n\nThe foundation of AI is based on practical applications whereas the dot-com companies had business models based on speculative ideas. Moreover, several sectors, including technology, healthcare, transportation, agriculture and finance, are adopting AI, curtailing sector-related bubbles’ risks.\n\nCompanies from these sectors utilize AI for product innovation, efficiency and cost savings. Thus, AI has more tangible economic benefits in contrast to the abstract nature of the dot-com period. Mature infrastructure like cloud computing platforms supports the deployment of AI technologies. However, these established infrastructures were not there for dot-com ventures.\n\nBooming AI to Boost the Stock Price of NVDA, AVGO, TSM\n\nThe global AI industry expanded beyond $184 billion in 2024, a jump of nearly $50 billion from 2023. The astounding growth is estimated to continue till 2030, with AI market size surpassing $826 billion, according to Statista.\n\nAI market size worldwide from 2020 to 2030\n\n(in billions of dollars) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nNVIDIA will benefit from this growth since the chip giant provides hardware and technologies vital for AI applications. NVIDIA’s graphic processing unit (GPU) is a core part of the computer server infrastructure required to train large language models and function AI interfaces.\n\nBroadcom also plays a crucial role in the AI ecosystem. Its products used in data centers are important for AI applications. Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan expects the company’s AI revenues to climb to $12 billion in fiscal 2024 and increase further in fiscal 2025 due to an uptick in demand for custom accelerators for AI data centers. Broadcom’s AI revenues increased 10% sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter to about $3.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC, manufactures chips for companies that make AI hardware and are therefore well-poised to gain from the flourishing AI industry. TSMC’s manufacturing capability is required for GPUs to be functioning. These GPUs are essential for data centers where huge amounts of data are stored. These data are needed for AI applications, whose demand has shot up and, in turn, is expected to boost TSMC’s business.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 71.1%\n\nA possible green light from the U.S. government to export chips to Saudi Arabia, the launch of the much anticipated next-generation Blackwell chip and a wide competitive moat in the GPU market space will surely help the NVIDIA stock to scale northward (read more: 2 Reasons NVIDIA Stock Popped Yesterday With More Room to Run).\n\nBrokers, thus, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 27.7% from the stock’s last closing price of $116.91. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 71.1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBroadcom Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 51.6%\n\nBroadcom’s capability to pay off debts banking on strong cash flow should propel its stock price. Broadcom’s free cash flow (FCF) was $4.791 billion in the fiscal third quarter, while revenues came in at $13.07 billion. Thus, the FCF margin was 36.65% (i.e., $4.791 billion/$13.07 billion in revenues), slightly more than last quarter’s 36% (read more: Broadcom Selloff Explained! Should You Buy the Dip in AVGO Stock?).\n\nHence, brokers have increased the average short-term price target of AVGO by 20.3% from the stock’s last closing price of $158.27. The highest price target is $240, an upside of 51.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTSMC Stock – Offers Price Upside of Up to 46.9%\n\nTSMC’s significant pricing power due to its supremacy in the high-end chip market, and being the exclusive manufacturer of Apple Inc’s AAPL AI chips should help its share prices scale upward (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\n\nTherefore, brokers have raised the average short-term price target of TSM by 20.3% from the stock’s last closing price of $170.23. The highest price target is $250, an upside of 46.9%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and TSMC have soared 140.6%, 47.4% and 64.8%, respectively, so far this year.

        "title": "Rate Cuts to Boost Crypto Market: 4 Bitcoin-Centric Stocks With Upside",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has been going through a rough patch over the past few weeks. Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, has particularly suffered the most in the past two months after hitting an all-time high earlier this year. Several factors have been responsible for Bitcoin’s recent decline, including a broader market selloff in early August.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential, and thinking from the long-term perspective, with the Federal Reserve nearing the end of its monetary tightening campaign, it would be ideal to adopt the buy-the-dip approach. Four Bitcoin-centric stocks with upside potential are Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, Block Inc. SQ, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD.\n\nMultiple Factors Hurting Bitcoin Stocks\n\nBitcoin has been in the bear market for the past two months. The cryptocurrency presently is trading at around $58,091.90, down more than 21% from its all-time high of $73,750 on March 14.\n\nBitcoin has been rangebound since April, briefly crossing the $65,000 mark in June. Even the halving event in April failed to boost Bitcoin's price. The halving event—which typically reduces the reward for mining new blocks by 50% to cap the total Bitcoin supply at 21 million—tends to drive up demand and prices. However, this time, Bitcoin's value fell significantly after the halving.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market took a further blow during the broader market bloodbath in early August that was triggered by fears of a slowing economy. Bitcoin price fell below $55,000 after that. However, Bitcoin has since been trying to stage a comeback but has been rangebound.\n\nBitcoin Stocks to Benefit From Rate Cuts\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve is unlikely to go for a big rate cut following the release of soft inflation data, investors are confident that the central bank will cut interest by at least 25 basis points.\n\nPresently, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 100% probability of a 25-basis point interest rate cut in the Fed’s September FOMC meeting. For November, market experts predict a 100% chance that the total (year-to-date) rate cut will be 50 basis points and a 94.4% possibility that it will reach 75 basis points.\n\nAny size of rate cut bodes well for growth assets like cryptocurrencies as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t provide yields. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors are more inclined to seek assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve greater risk.\n\n4 Crypto-Centric Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nInteractive Brokers Group\n\nInteractive Brokers Group is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR’s commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 60 days. IBKR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlock\n\nBlock is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of the Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ’s decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\n\nBlock has an expected earnings growth rate of 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.8% over the past 60 days. SQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.5% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nRobinhood Markets operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Best High Risk High Reward Growth Stock To Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 High Risk High Reward Growth Stocks Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other high risk high reward growth stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to making money on the stock market, most investors are typically attracted to growth stocks. Growth stocks are primarily identified by the price to earnings ratio (P/E) for those firms that are profitable. A higher P/E ratio compared to the industry multiple means that investors have already priced in future growth into the share price to an extent and any surpassing of investor expectations sees the share price appreciate. Since some firms, particularly those in the software as a service (SaaS) industry, reinvest their revenue into growth, their earnings are often negative. Subsequently, the growth potential of these stocks is evaluated by their EV/Sales ratio, and you can find more details by reading 11 Best Cloud Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nHowever, while these metrics are important for evaluating stocks, they often do not cover the riskiest stocks that promise the highest returns. In theory, stocks with the lowest prices often carry a higher potential of 10x or even 100x gains. This is because their low prices and small market size both have a substantially larger potential for growth when compared to bigger firms. These returns typically materialize over the course of several decades.\n\nFor instance, after accounting for their stock splits, the three most valuable firms in the world were trading at $0.10, $0.11, and $0.04, respectively. In today’s post inflationary terms, this means that their shares started to trade at $0.19, $0.21, and $0.08 in the same order. As a result, these bottom barrel stocks at the time of their IPOs, have delivered 183,916%, 401,600%, and 256,975% in returns through price appreciation after their stock market debut.\n\nIn short, these 1,500x+ returns through price appreciations are what drive countless investors to flock to the stock market daily. Yet, these returns also mean that investors, particularly inexperienced ones or those on the retail side, fall victim to scams. In fact, along with offering the highest potential for returns, micro cap stocks are also the ones with the greatest number of scams. For instance, one common way in which stock brokerages target unsuspecting retail investors is through a chop stock. This practice isn’t illegal, but it involves the seller withholding key information from the buyer. A chop stock is a stock that a brokerage buys from a large shareholder at a deep discount and then sells to unwary buyers at market price which creates a conflict of interest for the selling party as it stands to significantly profit from any sale.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there are no surefire ways to spot a chop stock, an investor should be on the lookout for stocks that their brokerages (or others) are selling at slight or medium discounts to the market price, and in case of the brokerages, not disclosing the commission made from the sale. The mantra is simple: If it’s too good to be true, it generally is. While all this sounds nefarious, it isn’t the only legal way that gullible investors are exploited on the stock market.\n\nIn fact, one of the more common and legal ways through which investors, particularly in smaller companies, are harmed is additional share issues by firms who are struggling to raise capital through profits or debt financing. Share sales, even though they provide investors an opportunity to profit via price appreciations, are less riskier than debt issues since in case a company becomes a gone concern, debt holders are required to be paid back first. Naturally, firms prefer them for these reasons, but the more shares are issued, the lower the value of existing equity becomes. Consequently, you are likely to see micro cap stocks in particular drop in prices after management announces additional equity raises.\n\nAdditionally, firms that are struggling operationally try to shore up their corresponding stock devaluation through reverse stock splits. These reduce the number of shares outstanding but also end up providing unwary investors with a false sense of comfort in seeing the value of their investments increase. Since the share price appreciation is unrelated to business fundamentals, it carries the risk of depreciation in the future if the firm fails to reverse poor performance. This fact is also backed by research from the University of Texas and Lamar University. After analyzing 1,206 reverse stock splits between 1995 and 2011, the research demonstrates that less than half, 500 or 41%, of the firms, were able to continue operations for five years or longer after the reverse split. Out of the other 59%, a whopping 80% were de listed from exchanges less than five years after the reverse split, for reasons that include bankruptcy. The remaining 20% were acquired, and for this subset, the median survival time post split was just 20.9 months.\n\nThere are some tips that an investor can use to avoid stock scams. For instance, one should never fall for a sense of urgency created by the seller, believe only in verifiable and raw numbers as opposed to ‘testimonials’ that promise quick riches, ensure that anyone selling an investment is a licensed finance professional, be on the lookout for effort free ways to quickly make massive amounts of money, and follow the principle of ‘if it’s too good to be true, it generally isn’t.’ Other warning signs of micro cap stock fraud include stocks of shell companies with little to no operations, heavy promotion of the stock as opposed to the actual business, sudden and rapid jumps in share prices and trading volume, and trading suspensions by the SEC.\n\nInvestment research websites, newsletters, emails, and even newspapers can all pitch micro cap stock scams. So just because the source appears credible doesn’t mean the underlying stock is as well. Finally, research is a non negotiable for any investment decision, and the SEC has listed several ways to conduct research. Yet, just because a firm regularly releases information doesn’t mean that it’s ripe for investment solely because of this fact.\n\nWith these details in mind, let’s take a look at some high risk high reward growth stocks to buy.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The High Risk High Reward Growth Stock To Buy?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s largest and most valuable GPU designer which also has exposure to the tangential data center networking, autonomous driving, and consumer and professional graphics industries. Its high performing GPUs have allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third most valuable company in the world in terms of market capitalization. Its GPUs are one of the hottest commodities in the world, which provides the firm with a wide moat. However, their short supply and the rush in the industry to implement AI software have also forced companies to look for alternatives to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s products. This has seen firms like OpenAI work with Broadcom to design NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU alternatives. Additionally, the firm can see stricter action by the US government for purported abuse of market power as well as an AI slowdown or a GPU glut to create further headwinds for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares that have lost 23% since mid June. However, the firm’s key competitive advantages because of its strong product performance and established demand for its products make NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) less risky than most of the stocks on our list.\n\nArtisan Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“NVIDIA’s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That’s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA’s market cap is now $3 trillion. So is the GDP of France.\n\nDoes this make any sense? We wish that we could definitively say that it doesn’t, given that we don’t own NVIDIA. But the answer is more complicated. The growth in revenue and profits at NVIDIA has been stunning. In the calendar year 2020, its revenue was about $17 billion. Estimates for 2024 are around $120 billion. Operating profit is projected to reach about $80 billion in 2024 versus $4.5 billion in 2020. NVIDIA’s revenue essentially represents the capital spending of a small number of very profitable, very cash-rich technology companies buying up the processors necessary to power artificial intelligence (AI) software programs. It’s an AI landgrab. In order for NVIDIA to sustain these levels of revenue or grow them from here, these AI investments must start to generate an ROI for those splashing out $120 billion a year. And if not generating an ROI in the near term, those companies must at least see the prospect of an ROI, a clear sustainable competitive advantage or a moat of some kind.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of high risk and high reward stocks. But our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Terms haven’t been finalized and could still change, one of the people said.\n\nThe move comes as the company mulls an initial public offering that may come as soon as next year.\n\nA CoreWeave representative declined to comment.\n\nA $23 billion valuation would mark another sharp rise for CoreWeave, a premium to the $19.1 billion valuation it received in May, when it finalized a roughly $1.1 billion preferred equity investment from investors including Coatue Management and Magnetar Capital. The company was valued at $7 billion in an earlier round in December.\n\nIn May, the company also secured a new $7.5 billion credit facility from lenders including Magnetar, Blackstone Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc.\n\nCoreWeave, which counts Nvidia Corp. as an investor, was an early adopter of Nvidia’s graphics chips for data centers, getting ahead of a wave of demand for powerful processors to run artificial intelligence applications. It’s building out data centers based on Nvidia’s chips to offer AI-related computing.\n\nCoreWeave’s investors also include the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario, Jane Street and JPMorgan Asset Management, among others.\n\nIn March, CoreWeave named Nitin Agrawal, a former Google executive, as chief financial officer.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar Over the Next 5 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.",
        "content": "Undoubtedly, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has already seen its stock soar. As the chipmaker became the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, its share price rose, and it's now up by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023. Yet that wasn't the first time the company's market cap multiplied in a relatively short period. Between early 2020 and late 2021, Nvidia's stock gained more than 400%.\n\nI think it may be some time before we see the company make another run on par with either of those. To be sure, Nvidia is in a strong position to continue growing its market-leading data center segment for some time. Major customers such as MetaPlatforms and Alphabet are showing no signs of slowing their massive spending on data center infrastructure. That being said, its growth will likely be slower than what fueled its most recent run.\n\nWe're already seeing this play out. As the graph below shows, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth is decelerating. Don't get me wrong -- its 122% growth in Q2 was still incredible, but it was less than half what the previous two quarters delivered, and the company is projecting roughly 80% year-over-year growth for the current quarter. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAutonomous driving will be the catalyst for Nvidia's next big inflection point\n\nIn Q2, Nvidia's automotive arm produced $346 million in revenue. That's not bad, but it's a far cry from where it could be in the future. In fact, CEO Jensen Huang believes it to be a $300 billion market. This would include the software and hardware that will be embedded both in the cars themselves and in data centers that will be integral to powering an autonomous vehicle network. Huang says he believes this will be \"one of the largest AI industries in the world.\"\n\nOf course, we should take a CEO's words with a grain of salt when they're talking about their company's future opportunities, but Huang's estimation is in line with analysis from respected research firms. How long it will be before the technology matures to a point where it can really take off is the bigger question. It may be some time before we have truly autonomous cars on the road, but there has been a lot of progress toward that goal of late. I think it's more than possible that this market will begin to explode before the end of the decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 8.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of +82.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 points to a change of +115.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.69 indicates a change of +31.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $32.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +79.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $123.57 billion and $168.55 billion estimates indicate +102.8% and +36.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Loading Up on Stocks Again; Here Are the 6 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "While election season is keeping politicians occupied along with their regular legislative duties, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, hasn't lost focus on adding to her stock portfolio. The representative from the Peach State steadfastly picked up new positions throughout the past few months, demonstrating interest in everything from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to Vanguard funds.\n\nIn the latest go-round, Greene, increased her AI exposure in a variety of ways, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). While Greene didn't disclose the exact amount that she invested in each of the stocks, her regulatory filing reveals that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nMore of the same magnificent (and other) names\n\nReviewing her stock purchases over the past few months, investors will find that Greene clearly has a penchant for artificial intelligence stocks -- in particular, \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. In fact, in her latest round of buying activity, Greene was building larger positions in stocks she had already purchased. Greene scooped up shares of Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia on Sept. 3, having bought the same stocks on Aug. 21. Greene didn't disclose her motivation for the move, but it's possible that she sensed a buying opportunity. Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia fell 5%, 2%, and 16%, respectively, between Aug. 21 and Sept. 3.\n\nWhile there's no clear explanation for the sell-off in Alphabet stock at that time, it may simply be an extension of the market's skepticism regarding Alphabet's future after it lost an important antitrust case over the summer. With regard to Amazon, investors may have been bearish in reaction to Reuters reporting on Aug. 29 that some Amazon workers would join a Teamsters strike against unfair labor practices that had extended into several states. And investors were likely clicking the sell button on Nvidia stock after the company failed to meet the market's sky-high expectations for its second-quarter 2025 financial results.\n\nApple represents another Magnificent Seven stock that found its way to Greene's buy list again. Previously, Greene had bought the tech superstar's stock in May, and it's possible that she chose to increase her position in September after a slight sell-off following news that Warren Buffett pared the BerkshireHathaway position in Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough it's not a Magnificent Seven stock, CrowdStrike is another repeat-buy stock that Greene had bought previously -- this one in in June. Perhaps sensing another bargain, Greene may have seen value in the cybersecurity specialist, whose stock took a nosedive, after it was found to be largely responsible for causing global internet outages in July.\n\nDriving in a new direction\n\nHitching a ride with an electric vehicle (EV) stalwart for the first time, Greene added shares of Tesla to her portfolio -- a stock that provides even more exposure the burgeoning field of AI. In addition to providing Tesla drivers with the option for autonomous driving capability with its AI-powered full self-driving mode, Tesla has committed to developing humanoid robots that are embedded with AI.\n\nDespite its stock falling in late July and into August, Tesla electrified the hopes of some investors in August when they learned that the company's Cybertruck sales were strong in July -- an auspicious sign for a stock that many had maligned after the company reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nWhat's a Main Street investor to do?\n\nSmart as it may be to dig into politicians' stock buys and sales, it's never a wise move to blindly follow their actions. Instead, investors should resolve to use the knowledge of politicians' stock moves as starting points for engaging in further research. Nonetheless, Greene's recent stock picks are all worthwhile considerations at the moment, as all six stocks are industry leaders that provide investors with varying types of exposure to AI.\n\nFor those looking to strengthen their holdings with a leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike is a worthy consideration even after the July incident. Similarly, with bearish sentiment surrounding Alphabet from its lost antitrust case, now may be a good time to pick up shares for those with long-term investing horizons who don't find near-term volatility daunting. And with regard to Amazon, the company continues to report strong financials thanks to its Amazon Web Services business along with its other offerings, even inspiring billionaires to click the buy button.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and Tesla, on the other hand, are three AI powerhouses that continue to dominate their respective fields and are well worth strong consideration from investors with varying types of investing goals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top fund picks for self-invested pensions",
        "content": "Friday marks the end of pension awareness week. Since automatic enrolment become a legal requirement in 2017, millions of workers have joined pension schemes. But what else can they do to prepare for retirement?\n\nThere is a host of information available to make people aware of benefits of pension schemes and while tools like the pensions dashboard are still in the making there are options to explore, such as a self-invested personal pension (SIPP).\n\nA SIPP, as the name suggests, is something you can do yourself provided you have the required expertise and knowledge of investing in stock markets. However, it is recommended that you use a regulated financial adviser to help choose and manage SIPP investments if not.\n\nHelen Morrissey, Yahoo Finance UK's pensions columnist and head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the flexibility to manage your investments was a \"huge benefit\" of SIPPs.\n\n\"You will have access to a wider range of investments than with a standard pension provider,\" she adds. That includes shares, funds, investment trusts and even property.\n\nRead more: How to make sure you'll get the full state pension\n\n\"This range of choice gives you the opportunity to invest in line with your values while building your financial resilience in retirement,” Morrissey says.\n\nAnyone under the age of 75 in the UK can open a SIPP and you can also hold one in addition to a workplace pension. In fact, you can ask an employer if they would contribute to SIPP instead of a workplace pension.\n\nAs with other types of pension, SIPP investments can grow free from income and capital gains taxes. In addition, contributions are also eligible for tax relief, meaning the government effectively tops up money you pay into a SIPP or other pensions, by 20%.\n\nHigher-rate tax payers can also claim back an additional 20% through a self-assessment tax return, going up to 25% for additional-rate taxpayers.\n\nThe maximum most people can contribute tax-free to their SIPP a year is £60,000.\n\nRead more: Pension savings needed to retire jumps amid cost of living crisis\n\nEmma Wall, head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that both workplace pensions and SIPPs can be set to a \"default option\", where investments are based around a set level of risk depending on life stage.\n\nFor those still working and far away from retirement, also known as the \"accumulation phase\", she explains that the pension pot is typically invested more in \"growth assets\" like stocks. Meanwhile, the importance of capital preservation for those approaching retirement age means their pot tends to be invested in lower-risk assets, such as bonds.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"For most people, this default will be ideal to take care of your retirement savings,\" Wall says. \"But for some, this may be an opportunity to express values, avoid certain sectors or supplement other investments.\"\n\nIf that is the case, here are some funds which experts say are worth considering to include among your SIPP investments.\n\nFund picks for SIPPs\n\nThe first Wall suggests taking a look at is the Legal & General Future World ESG Developed Index (0P0001F4XX.L), which is a passive fund invested in about 1,400 global companies that are listed in developed markets – predominantly the US, UK and Europe.\n\nThe fund is focused toward sectors such as technology, pharmaceuticals and financials and weights more money in companies that score well on different environmental, social and governance factors.\n\n\"Global equity funds provide a good foundation to an investment portfolio focused on long-term growth,\" says Wall. \"Investing in companies across the globe provides a good level of diversification in a single fund.\"\n\nTop holdings in the fund, as of June, included tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nThe fund has generated a return of 20% on a one-year basis and 73% over five years, according to data provided by Hargreaves Lansdown. That is only slightly behind the performance of its benchmark, the Solactive L&G Enhanced ESG Developed Index, which is up nearly 22% over one-year and 77% over five-years.\n\nNext up is the Schroder Asian Alpha Plus (0P0000T360.L) fund, which is an active fund that invests in larger companies in the likes of Hong Kong, India and Taiwan. Samsung (005930.KS), Tencent (0700.HK) and Infosys (INFY) are technology stocks included in the fund's top 10 holdings.\n\nRead more: Moneybox, NatWest Cushon, and Smart Pension join pensions dashboard scheme\n\nRichard Sennitt, who has been at Schroders since 1993, is the lead manager on the fund, which is up 10% over the last year, versus a 12% rise in the benchmark MSCI AC Asia ex Japan index. Over five years, the fund has comfortably beaten the 21% return generated by the benchmark, up 31%.\n\n\"Asian funds are a great way to add diversification to a portfolio that is focused on long-term investing, which makes them ideal for a SIPP,\" says Wall.\n\nJonathan Moyes, head of investment research at the Wealth Club, says that another portfolio diversifier could be the HgCapital Trust (HGT.L), as it provides investors access to the private equity firm's funds through a single listed investment.\n\n\"Individual investors tend to have limited access to leading private equity firms, and so the likes of the HgCapital Trust enable investors to gain exposure to one of the world’s best performing private equity managers,\" Moyes explains.\n\nThe Hg private equity firm specialises in investments in European and North American B2B software and service businesses and has more than $70bn under management. That makes it one of the largest private software investors in the world.\n\nMoyes also points out that it has posted an annual return of nearly 16% over the 25 years to June.\n\nIncome and capital growth funds\n\nMeanwhile, Dzmitry Lipski, head of fund research at Interactive Investor, highlights the Artemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L) fund, which \"aims to provide investors with a steady and growing income along with capital growth over the longer term.\"\n\nThe fund typically holds 50 to 70 investments, which he says \"tend to be stable, well-established businesses with the financial strength to pay solid dividends to shareholders.\"\n\nStocks in the portfolio include supermarket Tesco (TSCO.L), clothing retailer Next (NXT.L) and pharmaceuticals firm GSK (GSK.L). A self-invested personal pension (SIPP) is one way people can prepare for retirement.  (Xavier Lorenzo via Getty Images)\n\nOver one-year the fund has returned 20%, against a 14% rise in the FTSE All-Share tracker, with Lipski pointing out that it currently has a yield of nearly 4%.\n\nAnother fund that he said can deliver both income and capital growth is the Fidelity Global Dividend (0P00017LRC.L) fund.\n\nThe focus is on high-quality mega-cap companies in developed markets, with stocks held in fund including consumer goods giant Unilever (ULVR.L), analytics company RELX (REL.L) and UK energy network the National Grid (NG.L).\n\nRead more: The top FTSE 100 winners and losers of 2024 so far\n\n\"The manager adopts a conservative strategy, focusing on companies with clear business models, healthy cash flows and have minimal debt,\" says Lipski.\n\nThe fund has delivered a one-year return of 19%, higher than the 12% generated across its global equity income fund sector. It currently has a yield of nearly 3%, according to Lipski.\n\nThe Man GLG High Yield Opportunities (0P0001I6OQ.L) fund is another option for SIPP investors seeking additional income, says the Wealth Club's Moyes. He points out that it is currently providing an inflation-busting yield of 7.5%.\n\nThe fund invests in high yielding bonds of companies that have a lower “credit rating” than those dubbed investment grade, which refers to quality of a company's credit.\n\n\"Whilst there are additional risks with high-yield bonds, the current environment is seeing investors being well compensated versus history,\" Moyes says.\n\nHe says that Man GLG's team of credit analysts aim to \"uncover bonds that might be offering particularly good value\".\n\nThe fund has generated a one-year return of 18%, ahead of the IA Sterling High Yield fund sector's 12% performance, according to Trustnet.\n\nCapital preservation funds\n\nFor those approaching retirement, Wall said that total return funds could be a good option for their SIPP, as they are more conservatively positioned than those that invest fully in company shares.\n\nThis type of fund normally invests in a mix of investments, including shares, bonds, commodities and currencies.\n\nRead more: How Keir Starmer's 'painful' autumn budget may impact your pension\n\n\"They could help provide modest growth for your investment portfolio over the long-term, and help shelter your money when stock markets fall, but are unlikely to keep up with stock markets when they rise quickly,\" Wall explains.\n\nOne fund pick Wall highlights is Troy Trojan (0P00002AVE.L), which has generated a return of 6% over the last year. That's ahead of its target to beat inflation based on the UK retail price index, which had grown nearly 3% as of the end of August.\n\n\"Manager Sebastian Lyon has managed this fund since its launch in 2001, through a variety of market conditions, testing this fund’s process and philosophy,\" Wall says.\n\nInvestments include short-dated UK and US government bonds, known as gilts and Treasuries respectively, as well as exposure to physical gold through exchange-traded commodities.\n\nThe gold price reached a record high in August, with the spot price hitting $2,532 per ounce and has since eased back but remains near highs. Troy Trojan's investment team said the fund's 12% allocation to gold, which acts as a safe haven investment amid uncertainty, had contributed to its year-to-date performance.\n\nRead more: Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\n\nStocks held in the fund include household-names such as Unilever and Nestle (NESN.SW).\n\nAnd capital preservation isn't just for investors nearing retirement, as Interactive Investor's Lipski said that trying to limit volatility in your pension portfolio makes sense as we move into a more period of more market uncertainty with upcoming central bank interest rate decisions and the US election in November.\n\nTo that end, Lipski suggests investors consider including Capital Gearing Trust (CGT.L) in their pension pot, as it aims to preserve capital over any 12-month period and deliver returns ahead of inflation in the long term.\n\nThe investment trust, which has been managed by Peter Spiller since 1982, had produced a share price total return of nearly 7% over one-year as of an August update. The UK's consumer price index, a core measure of inflation, was up 2.2% for the year to July.\n\nLipski says that the trust's strategy involves a \"highly diversified portfolio of assets with some to be negatively correlated to risk assets.\" This includes index-linked government bonds, which adjust interest and final payments for inflation, which account for around half of the trust's portfolio.\n\n\"Such bonds offer protection when stock markets fall, as well as providing a shield against inflation,\" he says.\n\n\"This trust as a good fit as a core holding due to its defensive stance and high levels of diversification,\" Lipski adds.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n2 Reasons NVIDIA Stock Popped, as Has More Room to Run\n\nNVIDIA Corporation’s meteoric rise in the last few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) came to a screeching halt last week after the company was plagued with antitrust issues.\n\nHowever, the possibility of a new U.S.-Saudi Arabia deal related to NVIDIA’s chips and encouraging comments on Blackwell chip production by CEO Jensen Huang lifted the semiconductor giant’s stock on Wednesday’s trading session by 8.2%.\n\nBut can NVIDIA’s share price scale upward for the rest of the year and beyond? Let’s have a look –\n\nUS Mulls Over Allowing NVIDIA Chips for Saudi Arabia\n\nOn Wednesday, Semafor, citing credible sources, stated that the U.S. government is considering allowing NVIDIA to export its advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, which would help the Middle Eastern nation run sophisticated AI models. At Saudi Arabia’s global AI summit, attendees discussed accessing NVIDIA’s H200 chips, initially used in OpenAI's GPT-4o, a multimodal transformer.\n\nIf the restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors are lifted, NVIDIA’s revenues will surge due to the heightened demand in Saudi Arabia. NVIDIA is making the most of the rise in global semiconductor sales, which hit $51.3 billion in July, up 18.7% year over year, per the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nHuang Issues Promising Guidance for Blackwell\n\nAt a technology conference hosted by Goldman Sachs on Wednesday, Huang said that NVIDIA has ramped up manufacturing of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips. Shipping of these high-end chips will begin in significant numbers in the fourth quarter to cater to high demand.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., and others have ordered the Blackwell chips in large numbers worth billions of dollars, while Amazon.com, Inc. is contemplating moving from Hopper to Blackwell as it has more AI throughput.\n\nThe new Blackwell’s NVLink will offer high-speed communication, while its graphic processing unit (GPU) will have more power. The NVIDIA CEO also confirmed they will move to other fabrications if required and reduce dependency on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited to develop the chip designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore NVIDIA Tailwinds: Supremacy in the GPU Space\n\nHuang recently said that a huge chunk of data would be transferred from the central processing units to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA since the chip giant has more than 80% share in the GPU market, which is estimated to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\n\nNVIDIA’s dominance in the GPU market propelled the company’s revenues from the data center GPU business to $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. In comparison, NVIDIA’s arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s revenues from the data center business grew 115% to only $2.8 billion.\n\nNVIDIA’s GPUs enjoy a wide competitive moat because of the dependency that developers have on the CUDA software platform. Unlike CUDA, AMD’s software platform, ROCm isn’t considered to be very efficient.\n\nNVIDIA is also benefiting from the growing interest in AI, as GPUs are an integral part of the computer server infrastructure needed to train large language models and operate AI interfaces. NVIDIA’s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after in the AI chip market. The AI industry is projected to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030, according to Markets and Markets.\n\nNVIDIA Stock: Strong Price Upside\n\nThe likely ease in restrictions on the sale of chips to Saudi Arabia, Blackwell production heating up, and the clear lead in the GPU space would boost NVIDIA’s shares in the near future.\n\nNotable brokers, hence, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 38.1% from the stock’s last closing price of $108.10. The highest price target set by the analysts is $200, signifying an upside of 85%.\n\nAdditionally, so far this year, NVIDIA’s shares have traded above the 200-day moving average, which is indicative of a prolonged uptrend.\n\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Step Aside, Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It in Favor of 2 Other High-Growth Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been all the rage on Wall Street since 2023 began, excitement surrounding stock splits has given AI a run for its money this year.\n\nA stock split gives publicly traded companies the ability to superficially alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. Splits are surface-scratching in the sense that they don't change a company's market cap or in any way affect underlying operating performance.\n\nAlthough there are two types of stock splits -- forward and reverse -- investors usually gravitate to companies conducting forward splits. This type of split is designed to lower a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who are unable to purchase fractional shares through their broker. Companies enacting forward splits are usually outpacing their competition from an execution and innovation standpoint. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince 2024 began, a little over a dozen leading businesses have announced or completed a stock split -- all but one of which was of the forward-split variety.\n\nHowever, the outlook for some of these premier stock-split stocks is mixed among Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. Based on the latest round of form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaires were decisive sellers of cutting-edge AI stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in the second quarter, but were avid buyers of two other high-growth stock-split stocks.\n\nBillionaires continue to reduce their stakes in Wall Street's AI darling\n\nFor three consecutive quarters, dating back to the start of October 2023, no fewer than seven billionaire money managers have reduced their respective stakes in Nvidia. The June-ended quarter featured seven billionaire sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nWith Nvidia completing its largest-ever forward split (10 for 1) in June, these billionaires might have chosen to ring the register and diversify their respective portfolios. But there looks to be more to this story than simple profit taking.\n\nAlthough Nvidia has undeniably benefited from its first-mover advantages as the standout supplier of AI graphics processing units (GPUs), competition is now coming at it from all angles.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the debut of Nvidia's Blackwell chip delayed by at least three months due to reported design flaws and supply chain issues, and the company's prized H100 GPU backlogged, it should be relatively easy for external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices to find strong demand for their AI GPUs.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's top customers are signaling an eventual reduced reliance on the AI kingpin. Its four largest clients by net sales are all developing AI GPUs that they plan to use in their data centers. Even with Nvidia's chips maintaining their computing advantage, the writing is on the wall that these customers intend to use their cheaper internally developed hardware.\n\nBillionaires might also be spooked by the persistent insider selling at Nvidia. While not all insider selling is necessarily nefarious (e.g., insiders sometimes sell stock to pay their tax bill), it is noteworthy that not one executive or board member has purchased shares on the open market since December 2020.\n\nLastly, billionaire asset managers might be concerned about what history tells us. Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, every next-big-thing trend has worked its way through an early-stage bubble. It's unlikely that AI is going to be the exception.\n\nBut while billionaires were showing Nvidia to the door, they were busy scooping up shares of two other high-growth stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nThe first stock-split stock that struck the fancy of six billionaire money managers during the second quarter is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a specialist in customizable rack server and storage solutions. These billionaire buyers were:\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (553,323 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group (508,814 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel (98,752 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (45,066 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (15,777 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,040 shares)\n\nWith the stock catapulting to north of $1,200 during the first quarter, it's not in the least bit surprising to see Supermicro's board approving a 10-for-1 forward split, to take effect after trading ends on Sept. 30.\n\nHowever, the prospect of a stock split isn't the primary draw for billionaires to Supermicro. The lure is the seemingly insatiable demand from businesses wanting to be among the first to capitalize on the AI revolution by training large language models and running generative Ai solutions. To do so, they'll need the necessary infrastructure in place, which Supermicro can provide.\n\nThe company's operating results have also given billionaires reason to be excited. Net sales jumped 110% to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ends on June 30), and the midpoint of its guidance calls for $28 billion in net revenue for the current year. This forecast screams that demand is exceptional at the moment.\n\nBut it won't be an easy ride. With its use of Nvidia's H100 GPUs in its customizable data-center rack servers, and the H100 backlogged, Supermicro finds itself at the mercy of its suppliers.\n\nFurthermore, the company is the target of a short-seller report from Hindenburg Research, which has alleged accounting manipulation. Despite denying these allegations, management did delay the annual filing of its operating results, which did little to soothe investor concerns.\n\nDespite its relatively inexpensive valuation, Super Micro Computer has a lot to prove to Wall Street and investors.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe other stock-split stock that billionaires very clearly favored over Nvidia in the June-ended quarter is AI networking solutions and services providers Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Seven billionaire investors took the plunge in the second quarter, including:\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Group (2,347,500 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,096,440 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel (1,880,740 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments (865,090 shares)\n\nKeeping with the theme of this list, Broadcom also announced a 10-for-1 forward split (the first in the company's history), which was completed in mid-July.\n\nBroadcom's AI ties have certainly been the fuel behind its recent uptick in growth. In particular, the company's networking solutions are responsible for connecting large numbers of AI GPUs in order to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing potential of AI-accelerating hardware. Presumably, demand for its AI networking solutions will remain robust as long as businesses keep gobbling up AI GPUs.\n\nHowever, billionaires might be equally excited about Broadcom having a solid foundation that extends well beyond artificial intelligence. It generates a significant amount of revenue and profits from the wireless chips and accessories it provides for next-generation smartphones. And it's a key provider of optical components used in automated industrial equipment, as well as networking solutions for next-gen vehicles.\n\nLastly, billionaires might be impressed with the company's track record of earnings-accretive acquisitions. For example, the $69 billion purchase of cloud-based virtualization software company VMware in November 2023 perfectly positions Broadcom to be an important player in helping businesses with their private- and hybrid-cloud needs.\n\nWith a more diverse revenue stream than Nvidia or Super Micro Computer, Broadcom would be best-positioned to navigate an AI bubble-bursting event, should one occur.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia 3 Months After Its Stock Split? Here's What History Says.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher over the past five years, even soaring past $1,000 early in 2024. This occurred as the company built its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, generating triple-digit revenue and profit growth, quarter after quarter.\n\nA stock price around or past the $1,000 mark isn't always accessible for every investor. Recognizing this, Nividia launched a stock split in early June.\n\nStock splits lower the per-share price of a company's stock through the issuance of additional shares to current holders. These moves don't change anything fundamental about a company, though, so they don't actually make the stock cheaper. However, the lower price still may attract investors who weren't ready to shell out hundreds of dollars or more prior to the split.\n\nNow, as we head into the third month after the split, it's fair to take a look at Nvidia's performance so far and consider whether this stock-market darling can keep on soaring. Let's look to history for some help. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's stock split\n\nThe company announced the plan to split its stock back in May, when shares were trading for more than $900. After the announcement, they quickly climbed past $1,000. The stock went on to gain nearly 30% from the announcement date through the split on June 7. The 10-for-1 split ratio meant the stock opened at about $120 on June 10.\n\nSince that time, Nvidia's shares have experienced a few ups and downs, but overall, they've lost about 4%. So we're far from the typical Nvidia performance we saw earlier in the year and throughout 2023.\n\nWhere are Nvidia shares heading next? History shows us that in 2 of the 3 previous Nvidia stock splits, after the first three months post-split, the stock went on to climb in the double digits over the next two months. But in the case of the other split, the shares fell in the double digits during that period.\n\nJust using that historical example, Nvidia's performance months after a stock split has been mixed, but leaning toward positive.\n\nNow let's consider broader data regarding stock splits. Overall, in a study from 1980 through today, companies that have split their stock have outperformed the S&P 500, according to a Statista report using Bank of America's Research Investment Committee data. Stocks that split posted an average total return of more than 25% in the 12 months following the announcement, twice the average return for the S&P 500 during that time, data shows.\n\nA potential boost for the stock\n\nWhy is that the case? The idea is that by lowering a stock price, more investors will flock to a stock, offering a boost. While this may be partly true, this isn't the only element investors look at. They won't buy a stock just because it completed a split.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, investors have started to worry about growing competition in the AI chip market, and concerns about the broader economy have taken root, too. Economic uncertainty generally weighs on high-growth companies like Nvidia because they rely on solid economic conditions to support their businesses. These factors, along with some profit-taking, have held Nvidia back in recent times.\n\nAs for what's ahead, history tells us Nvidia has a good chance of advancing in the coming months if the stock follows historical patterns. But history doesn't always repeat itself, so I wouldn't buy Nvidia today to make a quick gain. The good news, though, is Nvidia still has plenty of gas in the tank to deliver gains over the long term.\n\nThe company is about to launch its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever, and Nvidia promises to update its chips on an annual basis. This should keep revenue roaring higher. Of course, some customers will opt for a rival's lower-priced chip or use some of Nvidia's along with some of the rival's. But I don't expect this to significantly cut into Nvidia's market share, as the biggest AI players generally want the best and fastest chip around to power their projects.\n\nAll of this means that whether history is right about Nvidia's upcoming performance or not, you still could win by buying shares of the chip giant today and holding on for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in Asian trade on Friday, as investors held on to expectations of lower interest rates ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting that could potentially herald a larger easing cycle.\n\nWall Street indexes largely shrugged off some strong readings on consumer and producer inflation this week, with a rally in technology stocks, on renewed optimism over artificial intelligence, also factoring into gains.\n\nU.S. stocks also rose past some political uncertainty after a heated presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, where analysts saw Harris gaining an edge over the Republican candidate.\n\nS&P 500 Futures were flat at 5,603.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at19,444.00 points by 21:58 ET (01:58 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.1% to 41,177.0 points.\n\nFed set to cut rates, markets split between 25 or 50 bps decision\n\nThe central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates when it meets next week, although investors are split over whether it will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points.\n\nWhile sticky inflation data released this week saw expectations shift towards a 25 bps cut, some soft labor market data saw bets on a 50 bps cut come back into play.\n\nTraders were seen pricing in a 58% chance for a 25 bps, and a 42% chance of a 50 bps cut, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nNext week’s decision is likely to mark the beginning of an easing cycle for the Fed, with the central bank expected to cut rates by at least 100 bps this year. But investors were now seeking more concrete cues on this front, given that while Fed officials have signaled potential rate reductions, they have not provided any clear cues on the scale of any planned cuts.\n\nWall St buoyed by tech gains\n\nStill, the prospect of lower rates kept some risk appetite in play, while the dollar and Treasury yields retreated.\n\nWall Street indexes were also buoyed by gains in technology stocks, as strong earnings and guidance from Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), along with positive signals on demand from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), saw optimism over artificial intelligence come back into play.\n\nAn element of bargain buying also aided tech, after the sector was heavily sold off over the past month.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 5,595.8 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 17,59.68 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% to 41,096.77 points.\n\nWall Street indexes recovered from heavy losses logged last week, although they were still trading well below record highs hit earlier in the year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady with rate cuts in focus\n\nStory continues\n\nFTSE 100 hits one-week high as US rate cut expectations boost sentiment\n\nWall Street indexes close up; data keeps smaller Fed rate cut in view\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons the Historic Rise of AI Stocks Will Continue",
        "content": "Wednesday, stocks soared and have recovered most of last week’s losses. As has been the case several times during the current bull market, tech stocks and the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) led the way higher.\n\nWhile there has been some rotation recently, tech stocks again flexed their muscles, as evidenced by the QQQ doubling the gains of the other major U.S indices with its more than 2% gains on massive volume. What caused the market’s dramatic gains on Wednesday, and is the current correction over, or is the current rally nothing more than an oversold technical bounce?\n\nThe AI Buildout isn’t Slowing\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) CEO Charles Wilson once said in a congressional hearing, “As goes GM, so goes the market.” The quote went viral and is still cited today because it illustrates how, during bull market cycles, leading stocks in top industry groups can be a leading indicator. The artificial intelligence (AI) market ballooned from about $50 billion in 2023 to $184 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $826 billion by 2030 (according to Statista).\n\nNvidia is the Market Leader\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is the leader of the current bull market because its high-performance chips are perfect for the accelerated computing needed for AI. Rarely has a company of Nvidia’s size been able to produce such impressive earnings growth. From 2023 to 2024, NVDA’s annual earnings per share (EPS) will more than quadruple, and in 2025, Wall Street expects it to double again. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile Nvidia and fellow AI juggernauts like Arm Holdings (ARM) continue to produce robust earnings, there have been rumblings on Wall Street that AI-related purchases have gone too far, and that growth is not sustainable and will slow. However, this week, three significant happenings in the AI industry suggest that the AI buildout has much more meat on the bone.\n\n1. Jensen Huang Comments Spark Nvidia Rally\n\nYesterday at the Goldman Sachs (GS) tech conference NVDA CEO Jensen Huang said, “Demand for chips is great.” This seemingly simple statement reconfirmed to investors the massive demand for chips, sparked about a $250 million gain in NVDA’s market cap, and sent the Nasdaq flying higher. No one on Wall Street has their finger on the pulse of AI demand like Huang.\n\n2. OpenAI Valuation Soars\n\nOpenAI, which runs the most successful large language model (LLM) ChatGPT and counts Microsoft (MSFT) as its most prominent investor, is said to be seeking a more than $6 billion investment which would value the company at about $150 billion. OpenAI was valued at less than $100 billion earlier this year. Though the company’s revenues are minuscule compared to its valuation, the rise in value shows that investors are still anxious to get their hands on a piece of one of the most sought-after companies within the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Klarna Shaves Costs with AI\n\nSebastian Siemiatowski, the CEO of Swedish fintech giant Klarna, said this week that the company would sunset its software purchases from Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY) and replace them with AI-built internal tools. Earlier in the year Klarna announced that it was able to dramatically cut costs and increase customer satisfaction with AI. Klarna’s success in cutting costs with AI is likely to have a snowballing effect on tech companies looking to cut costs.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJensen Huang’s comments, OpenAI’s valuation hike, and Klarna’s success with AI are three signs that the AI revolution is far from over and the buildout will continue. Expect AI to lead the tech sector and buoy the market into next year.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a “fundamental shift” in the industry.\n\n“I know it’s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.”\n\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a “digestion” period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\n\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\n\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new “all-time record highs.”\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) The Top 10 Trending AI Stock Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said while talking to CNBC that the “poster child” of AI Nvidia’s declines represents a fundamental shift in tech stocks where investors expect ROI.\n\n“During 2021, revenue growth for Nvidia was up 62% year over year.. 2022, revenues were up 6% and the stock went down from peak to trough 66%. If you look at CapEX spending over the last two years and you see Nvidia’s revenues, Nvidia’s revenues last year grew over a 100%, this year they are gonna grow over a 100%,  I think what you are gonna see next year is a dramatic slowdown not only from the spending from hyperscalers but also in Nvidia’s revenues as those hyperscalers grow into all of this money that they have spent that’s not actually generating an increase in their revenue.”\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Niles is saying is not new. After Nvidia’s latest quarterly report, here is what InsiderMonkey’s Research Director Inan Dogan wrote in a report:\n\nNvidia’s market cap before today’s earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation’s quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA’s quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL’s quarterly profit is growing?\n\nInvestors were surprised to see that NVDA projected only an 8% quarterly revenue growth rate for its next quarterly report (vs. 15% for the last quarter). The decline in quarterly revenue growth rate is really concerning and if the decline continues, it will be awfully clear to investors that NVDA will never get to the $140 billion annual profit figure that its current stock price is demanding.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.\n\nDavid Tepper’s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\n“I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.”\n\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school — 100 shares of a $2 stock, “but then the whole thing went bankrupt,” he said.\n\n“It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.”\n\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper’s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he’d joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\n\nAccording to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World’s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nTepper’s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it’s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire’s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper’s Stake: $222,227,700\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush in a fresh note said the latest results from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and some other top tech companies should soothe market concerns about AI monetization.\n\nStory continues\n\n“On the semi front, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is now on the cusp of getting a piece of the growing AI $1 trillion of Cap Ex we expect to see over the next few years with the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia leading the charge,” Ives said.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Let’s have a look –\n\nUS Mulls Over Allowing NVIDIA Chips for Saudi Arabia\n\nOn Wednesday, Semafor, citing credible sources, stated that the U.S. government is considering allowing NVIDIA to export its advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, which would help the Middle Eastern nation run sophisticated AI models. At Saudi Arabia’s global AI summit, attendees discussed accessing NVIDIA’s H200 chips, initially used in OpenAI's GPT-4o, a multimodal transformer.\n\nIf the restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors are lifted, NVIDIA’s revenues will surge due to the heightened demand in Saudi Arabia. NVIDIA is making the most of the rise in global semiconductor sales, which hit $51.3 billion in July, up 18.7% year over year, per the Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nHuang Issues Promising Guidance for Blackwell\n\nAt a technology conference hosted by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, on Wednesday, Huang said that NVIDIA has ramped up manufacturing of the much-awaited next-generation Blackwell chips. Shipping of these high-end chips will begin in significant numbers in the fourth quarter to cater to high demand.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Meta Platforms, Inc. META have ordered the Blackwell chips in large numbers worth billions of dollars, while Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is contemplating moving from Hopper to Blackwell as it has more AI throughput.\n\nThe new Blackwell’s NVLink will offer high-speed communication, while its graphic processing unit (GPU) will have more power. The NVIDIA CEO also confirmed they will move to other fabrications if required and reduce dependency on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM to develop the chip designs (read more: Which Chip Stock to Buy in a Murky September? NVDA or TSM).\n\nMore NVIDIA Tailwinds: Supremacy in the GPU Space\n\nHuang recently said that a huge chunk of data would be transferred from the central processing units to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA since the chip giant has more than 80% share in the GPU market, which is estimated to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion in 2024, at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Bloomberg Intelligence - 2024 Data as of June\n\nNVIDIA’s dominance in the GPU market propelled the company’s revenues from the data center GPU business to $26.2 billion in the second quarter, up 154% year over year. In comparison, NVIDIA’s arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD revenues from the data center business grew 115% to only $2.8 billion.\n\nNVIDIA’s GPUs enjoy a wide competitive moat because of the dependency that developers have on the CUDA software platform. Unlike CUDA, AMD’s software platform, ROCm isn’t considered to be very efficient (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD or INTC?).\n\nNVIDIA is also benefitting from the growing interest in AI, as GPUs are an integral part of the computer server infrastructure needed to train large language models and operate AI interfaces. NVIDIA’s H100 graphic cards are the most sought-after in the AI chip market. The AI industry is projected to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030, according to Markets and Markets.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Has a Strong Price Upside\n\nThe likely ease in restrictions on the sale of chips to Saudi Arabia, Blackwell production heating up, and the clear lead in the GPU space would boost NVIDIA’s shares in the near future.\n\nNotable brokers, hence, have jacked up the average short-term price target of NVDA by 38.1% from the stock’s last closing price of $108.10. The highest price target set by the analysts is $200, signifying an upside of 85%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAdditionally, so far this year, NVIDIA’s shares have traded above the 200-day moving average, which is indicative of a prolonged uptrend.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and Nvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang met with senior Biden administration officials and other industry leaders at the White House on Thursday to discuss how to fill the massive infrastructure needs for artificial intelligence projects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race How Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\n\nOn the tech side, attendees also included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google President Ruth Porat and Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, according to people familiar with the meeting, which also had representatives from the energy sector. Government officials included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, according to the people.\n\nThe goal, according to a White House official, was to boost public-private partnerships around the development of AI data centers in the US. Topics included permitting, workforce, power demands and economic impacts of the facilities, people familiar with the meeting said.\n\nOpenAI, for example, plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on a domestic AI infrastructure push that spans data centers, energy capacity and transmission and semiconductor manufacturing — with investment from around the globe. Company executives have been meeting with government officials for months about a range of issues related to the initiative, including national security concerns that could be associated with foreign capital.\n\n“OpenAI believes infrastructure is destiny and that building additional infrastructure in the US is critical to the country’s industrial policy and economic future,” OpenAI said in a statement Thursday. The company highlighted the economic benefits of investing in US data center projects, including a possible 40,000 jobs across a number of US states. OpenAI pointed to similar investments by China, which aims to be a global AI leader by the end of the decade.\n\nPorat called robust US energy infrastructure crucial to ensuring US leadership in the emerging field of AI. “Today’s White House convening was an important opportunity to advance the work required to modernize and expand the capacity of America’s energy grid,” she said in a statement.\n\nAnthropic and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\nThe AI-fueled surge in US data center construction coincides with a broader manufacturing boost spurred by the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — the signature subsidy programs for semiconductors and clean energy enacted in 2022 under President Joe Biden.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose investments, along with data center expansion and other factors, are expected to drive electricity demand up by 15% to 20% over the next decade, according to the Energy Department. Data centers could consume as much as 9% of US electricity generation annually by 2030, up from 4% of total load in 2023, according to a report in May by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.\n\nThe Biden administration has said renewables such as wind and solar, as well as battery storage and energy efficiency gains, are some of the best ways to meet growing data center energy demand because they are rapidly scalable and cost competitive.\n\n“Near-term data center driven electricity demand growth is an opportunity to accelerate the build out of clean energy solutions, improve demand flexibility, and modernize the grid while maintaining affordability,” the Energy Department said in a blog post last month.\n\nHowever, the agency, which is set to release an assessment of energy consumption by data centers by years’ end, cautioned that projections of growth in electricity demand “continue to evolve due to developing use cases” and other factors.\n\n--With assistance from Courtney Rozen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single US Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Micron Gets a Rare Bear Call as BNP Paribas Warns on Oversupply",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Micron Technology Inc. shares tumbled on Thursday, with the maker of computer memory chips extending a recent selloff as BNP Paribas Exane warned that the stock would continue to underperform others connected to artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 NYC Transit Capital Upgrades Face $27 Billion Gap, DiNapoli Says\n\nKarl Ackerman downgraded the stock by two notches, to underperform from outperform, becoming the only analyst tracked by Bloomberg to recommend selling the shares. He also cut his price target to a Street-low view of $67, down from $140. In contrast, more than 90% of analysts have the equivalent of buy ratings, and the average price target is $156, more than 80% above its current price.\n\n“While some investors correctly anticipate downside risk to near-term results, we think Micron will underperform AI peers through ’25,” he wrote. He added that capacity oversupply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips will lead to “a faster than anticipated market correction of conventional DRAM ASPs,” referring to average selling prices for DRAM memory chips.\n\nShares fell 6% to $85.21. The stock is on track for its lowest close since February, having dropped more than 40% off a June peak. Even with that slump, Ackerman wrote, the “risk-to-reward at current level remains unfavorable.” Micron is essentially flat on the year, compared with a 16% gain for the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia Corp. is up nearly 140%.\n\nMicron’s high-bandwidth memory chips are expected to see a demand tailwind from AI, although some have argued the move is overdone. The company’s most recent results, from late June, featured a forecast that disappointed investors looking for a bigger AI-related boost. It will report fourth-quarter results later this month.\n\nOne point in favor of bulls is that the stock’s selloff has made it attractively valued by some metrics. It trades at less than 9 times estimated earnings, one of the lowest such multiples in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Nvidia, in contrast, trades around 33 times forward earnings.\n\nRaymond James is among the firms staying positive, writing that near-term weakness is already priced into the shares.\n\n“Micron appears firmly on track to achieve its HBM targets, and we expect ongoing yield improvement to remain a tailwind to margins,” wrote analyst Srini Pajjuri.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe affirmed an outperform rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $125 from $160, citing a recent multiple contraction in the sector. Despite that, he added, “a higher peak multiple is justified given the secular growth from HBM.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single US Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA): A Strong Buy According to Oppenheimer",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that’d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the “iPhone moment” for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the “App Store moment.”\n\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\n\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\n“Annual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.”\n\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Analysts Recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Stock?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nOppenheimer Asset Management recently gave a Buy rating to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n“Key positives for NVDA remain the stock’s bullish trend, high-momentum score, and portfolio tailwinds from a relatively strong Technology sector. In terms of trading, NVDA has inflected positively above the bullish slope of its 200-day average indicating a resumption of the stock’s uptrend, in our view,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business Professor of Finance, reiterated his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) thesis on a latest program on CNBC, calling the stock overvalued.\n\n“NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an amazing company, great growth, amazing cash flow, superb margins, but you are paying a premium price even given all of those pluses,” Damodaran said.\n\nAsked what’d be a better buy than NVDA, Damodaran said AMZN is a better stock.\n\n“Given the earnings and their cash flows if I had to buy a stock now and you forced me to a buy a big tech, I’d rather own Amazon I’d buy Amazon than buy Nvidia right now,” Damodaran added.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\n\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company is positioned well for mid-teens returns in the coming months due to a variety of factors, including strong AI chip demand, reasonable valuation, and robust earnings growth. The stock price has dropped amid a broader sell off in the tech sector, offering a buying opportunity for shrewd investors who have noticed that the P/E ratio of the firm is now in line with peers in the tech world, even as NVIDIA offers better growth prospects. An important catalyst that might spur the shares is the launch of Blackwell chips, possibly in the fourth quarter, driving strong demand from companies looking towards AI advancements.\n\nWall Street analysts are also overwhelmingly bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Bank of America has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of 165. In a recent investor note, the advisory named NVIDIA as the top sector pick, highlighting that near-term headwinds for the company could potentially create an enhanced buying opportunity with the stock trading within the lowest quartile of valuation in the past five years, even as it offers compelling growth at a compelling valuation.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "46% of Nvidia's $30 Billion in Q2 Revenue Came From 4 Mystery Customers",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\n\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's AI chips are the hottest product in Silicon Valley\n\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\n\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\n\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\n\nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period.\n\nCustomer concentration is concerning\n\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total.\n\nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\n\nCustomer Proportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue Customer A 14% Customer B 11% Customer C 11% Customer D 10%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\n\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\n\nWho are Nvidia's mystery customers?\n\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI. Meta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. Alphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half. Tesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software.\n\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\n\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\n\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Biren Technology, one of China's best hopes for challenging Nvidia, has hired an investment bank to commence the required \"tutoring\" process, a precursor to an initial public offering (IPO) in the country.\n\nThe Shanghai-based unicorn - valued at US$2.19 billion last November, according to venture deal tracker Pitchbook - has hired the city's largest brokerage, Guotai Junan Securities, to coach company executives on IPO-related issues, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Wednesday.\n\nThe tutoring process, which is mandatory for all IPO applicants in China before filing a listing plan, usually takes between three to 12 months. Neither Biren nor the CSRC has disclosed the planned location or fundraising target for the IPO.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nBiren's move comes two weeks after crosstown rival Enflame kicked off its tutoring process, as more Chinese chip designers look to raise capital in the public markets.\n\nZhang Wen, founder of Biren Technology. Photo: Handout alt=Zhang Wen, founder of Biren Technology. Photo: Handout>\n\nIn China, the integrated-circuit industry has bred more unicorns than any other sector in the past three years, according to a report earlier this week by Great Wall Strategy Consultants. However, the country's tech sector has been too heavily reliant on state-backed investments, which could lead to a \"big problem\", said Fang Fenglei, widely known as China's \"first investment banker\", at a forum on Wednesday.\n\nBiren counts venture capital firm HongShan, formerly Sequoia China, as one of its investors. The start-up had raised more than US$780 million from eight funding rounds as of April, Pitchbook data showed.\n\nStill, Biren has tried to obtain more support from the Chinese government after the US Commerce Department added the company and its Beijing-based rival Moore Threads onto a trade blacklist a year ago, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named because the information is private.\n\nUS sanctions have prevented Biren from engaging the service of world-leading foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, hobbling the start-up's chip production.\n\nFounded by Wall Street veteran Zhang Wen in 2019, Biren is among a group of Chinese graphics processing unit (GPU) developers hoping to take advantage of the absence of advanced chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices on the mainland. Under US export controls, the two California-based companies are barred from selling their best GPUs to customers in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiren launched its BR100 GPU in August 2022, claiming it had broken world records for computing power. The chip received substantial media coverage globally and raised eyebrows in the US. The BR100 is no longer listed on the company's website.\n\nThe start-up's current offerings include the Bili GPU series, which has entered mass production, according to the company.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Nvidia's Stock Is Down 27%, and an Eventual 75% Retracement May Be in the Cards",
        "content": "For the better part of the last three decades, investors have had a next-big-thing technology, innovation, or trend to captivate their attention.\n\nSince the internet completely changed the growth trajectory for businesses in the mid-1990s, we've witnessed massive addressable markets be assigned to genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, China stocks, U.S. housing, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, cannabis, augmented/virtual reality, and the metaverse. However, it's artificial intelligence (AI) that might be the cream of the crop among next-big-thing trends.\n\nAccording to Sizing the Prize, which is an in-depth report released by the analysts at PwC, AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the end of the decade. These gains are expected to come in the form of increased productivity and various consumption-side benefits.\n\nA $15.7 trillion opportunity leaves plenty of wiggle room for multiple businesses to come out as winners -- perhaps none more so than semiconductor colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI revolution has driven Nvidia's historic ascent\n\nWhen 2022 came to a close, Nvidia was a $360 billion company that had fringe importance within the tech sector. Less than 18 months later, shortly after completing a historic 10-for-1 stock split, its valuation would tip the scales at a peak of $3.46 trillion, making it (briefly) the world's most-valuable publicly traded company.\n\nAt no point in history have we witnessed a market-leading business add more than $3 trillion in value in less than 18 months. The catalyst behind this never-before-seen move has undeniably been the AI revolution.\n\nIt took almost no time for Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) to become the top choice for businesses running generative AI solutions and wanting to build/train large language models (LLMs). Orders for the company's H100 GPU and next-generation Blackwell chip, which is slated for its debut in the first quarter of 2025, are backlogged.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's CUDA platform is playing a key role in keeping enterprise clients loyal to its ecosystem. CUDA is the toolkit developers are using to build LLMs and get the most out of their Nvidia GPUs.\n\nControlling an estimated 98% of the GPU market for AI-accelerated data centers in each of the previous two years has afforded Nvidia a stunning degree of pricing power. Whereas businesses are paying between $10,000 and $15,000 for the MI300X AI-GPU from Advanced Micro Devices, they're forking over $30,000 to $40,000 for Nvidia's H100. A 100% to 300% premium to competing chips has translated into a better than 10-percentage-point increase in the company's gross margin over the last six quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this seemingly ideal execution, Nvidia's share price has fallen by 27% from its all-time high set in June, and may be primed for an even steeper decline.\n\nNvidia may eventually shed three-quarters of its value\n\nConsidering the lofty growth and profit projections Wall Street is forecasting Nvidia will hit in the years to come, an eventual 75% decline from its $140.76 all-time high probably sounds absurd. However, history has yet to be defeated when it comes to next-big-thing innovations.\n\nThough quite a few game-changing technologies and trends went on to become quite successful for patient investors (e.g., the internet and businesses-to-business commerce), one thing all new technologies, innovations, and trends share is early stage bubbles.\n\nWhile it's impossible to pinpoint when the euphoria surrounding a potentially game-changing innovation will fade, one consistency with the \"next big thing\" on Wall Street is that investors always overestimate how quickly a technology or trend will become mainstream.\n\nBased on the amount of money businesses are spending on their AI data centers, you'd probably think artificial intelligence is on a path for rapid adoption. But dig deeper and you'll find that most businesses lack a clear game plan for how they're going to deploy AI or monetize the technology for their benefit. It's a telltale sign that we're witnessing the next bubble take shape. Market leaders of next-big-thing bubbles have a history of losing 75% to 99% of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\n\nThe one saving grace for Nvidia is that it had other foundational operating segments in place prior to AI euphoria taking shape. Even if the technology needs multiple years to mature and sales slow dramatically, Nvidia will be able to lean on GPU sales for gaming and cryptocurrency mining, as well as revenue from its virtualization software segment, to somewhat cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is set to face fundamental pressures, too\n\nBeyond historic precedent, there are also fundamental reasons to believe Nvidia's sheen is going to wear off as external and internal competitive pressures build.\n\nAs I alluded earlier, AMD's MI300X is priced at a notable discount of 50% to 75% below the selling price of the H100. Between Nvidia's extensive backlog and the lure of considerably less-expensive AI-GPUs, AMD and other Nvidia rivals should have no trouble locating demand for their data-center hardware.\n\nWhat seems to be flying under the radar for most investors is the potential for internal competition.\n\nFour members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" account for in the neighborhood of 40% of Nvidia's net sales. While, on one hand, it's fantastic that Nvidia is the go-to hardware supplier for America's most-influential businesses, investors should also understand that all four of these companies are internally developing AI-GPUs to deploy in their data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell chips retain their computing advantage, these Magnificent Seven companies are incented to use these cheaper and more available internally developed chips in a complementary fashion in their data centers.\n\nThe real issue with an uptick in internal competition is that it reduces the AI-GPU scarcity that's driven Nvidia's exceptional pricing power. With less pricing power over time, the expectation would be for the company's gross margin to decline.\n\nMoreover, internal competition is going to reduce opportunities for Nvidia to secure valuable data center real estate from America's leading businesses. This suggests we've likely witnessed a peak in orders from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nNvidia is historically pricey, too. There have only been a handful of instances in the last 30 years where a business on the cutting edge of a next-big-thing innovation had a trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio near 40. Prior instances have resulted in these stocks shedding around 90% of their value on a peak-to-trough basis.\n\nWhether it's historic precedent or its fundamental roadmap. Nvidia appears likely to eventually shed much of its gains since the start of 2023.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Two of China’s most prominent designers of AI chips are targeting initial public offerings in Shanghai as soon as this year, taking advantage of growing appetite for domestic players seeking to challenge Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus\n\nShanghai Enflame Technology Co. aims to raise as much as 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in an IPO on Shanghai’s STAR board, choosing a venue friendly to loss-making but fast-growth startups, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans. Rival Shanghai Biren Intelligent Technology Co. plans to file for its own IPO on the same bourse, people familiar with the matter said. Both now aim to formally file documents this year, eyeing a 2024 or early 2025 debut.\n\nThe pair of Shanghai-based chipmakers will join peer Cambricon Technologies Corp. on their home city’s bourse, which is trying to mold the STAR exchange into the country’s premier tech listings destination. Biren and Enflame, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., expect to draw investor interest because of a scarcity of listed chipmakers, despite that industry’s importance to Beijing’s geopolitical goals.\n\nChina is accelerating a campaign to develop a world-class semiconductor industry, an effort that the US is trying to curtail with sanctions and blacklists of companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. That conflict in recent years has expanded into the field of AI: Biren is one of several Chinese semiconductor firms on US blacklists that restrict their access to American technology.\n\nBiren and Enflame have kicked off their IPO process by going into the usual “education period” for would-be debutantes, according to Chinese regulatory notices. While it’s targeting the relatively niche STAR board, Biren’s management hasn’t yet ruled out Hong Kong as a destination should the Shanghai process bog down, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for Enflame and Biren didn’t respond to emails and calls to their main lines seeking comment.\n\nLike Nvidia, the pair make chips that developers use to train and support AI services, though they’re generally considered inferior in power and performance. Still, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies to develop, support and adopt local alternatives, fearful that Washington will ramp up efforts to choke off the flow of Western technology needed to power everything from AI to the military. Other notable AI chip designers include Moore Threads Intelligent Beijing Co. and T-Head, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnflame was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices Inc. employees in 2018. It was valued at about 18 billion yuan — or 62 times its 2022 sales — after completing a 2.5 billion yuan pre-IPO fundraising this year, according to an investor deck viewed by Bloomberg News.\n\nTencent controls more than a fifth of the company, alongside other backers including the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund — known as the Big Fund and the main financing vehicle for the country’s most important chip projects.\n\nFounded in 2019, Biren focuses on areas such as graphics processing units and cloud computing, and is considered one of the most promising domestic contenders to Nvidia.\n\nBacked by IDG Capital, Ping An Insurance Group Co. and China Merchants Capital, it sought in 2022 to raise funds at a valuation of 17 billion yuan, Bloomberg News reported at that time. That year, it declared it was “setting a new record in global computing power” with its first general-purpose GPU.\n\nHow China Aims to Counter US Efforts at ‘Containment’: QuickTake\n\n--With assistance from Zheping Huang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 12, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCEO Jensen Huang Sells Chunk of NVIDIA Stock, But Why You Shouldn’t\n\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock’s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA’s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let’s have a look –\n\nNVIDIA Stock – CEO Sells Shares, Volatility Intensifies\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker’s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\n\nOn Friday, NVIDIA’s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world’s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\n\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons –\n\nNVIDIA’s Blackwell Chip to Be a Game Changer\n\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock’s 2025 results.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell’s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\n\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA’s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures — Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\n\nNeither NVIDIA Stock Nor AI is in a Bubble\n\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies’ shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\n\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company’s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company’s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\n\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry’s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company’s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\n\nNVIDIA’s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry’s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\n\nWhat’s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\n\n2 More Reasons to be Bullish on the NVIDIA Stock\n\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA’s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\n\nNVIDIA’s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVDA Shares\n\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA’s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\n\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock’s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts’ highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\n\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\n\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "The FTSE 100 and European European stocks joined the global rally on Thursday, jumping in early trade ahead of an interest rate announcement by the European Central Bank.\n\nThe FTSE 100 (^FTSE), DAX (^GDAXI) and CAC (^FCHI) all jumped more than 1% after the opening bell in Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) also rose 1.1%. The European central bank is expected to cut its baseline interest rate from 4.25% to 4% later this morning. At the end of August, data showed that inflation had fallen to 2.2% in the bloc, the lowest reading since 2021. The moves also follow bullish sentiment around chipmakers and companies fuelling the AI boom. Nvidia (NVDA)'s stock moved more than 8% higher as its CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for the company’s products as “so great” that it “is really emotional\". Speaking at Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, he added: “We have a lot of people [on] our shoulders, and everybody’s counting on us.\"\n\nLive4 updates\n\nThu 12 September 2024 at 12:18 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nThursday in Asia\n\nAsian stocks tipped higher on Thursday, buoyed by inflation data and a broader tech rally.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)'s more than 8% gain on Wednesday in the US set the tone, while Japanese stocks gained on data that showed the heat has come out of inflation.\n\nThe corporate goods price index (CGPI) rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed, slowing from a 3.0% gain in July. It fell short of market forecasts for a 2.8% increase.\n\nThe Nikkei (^N225) gained 3.4% by the end of the session. Thu 12 September 2024 at 12:12 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nWhat's happening in premarket?\n\nHere's what the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are doing in premarket: Thu 12 September 2024 at 12:11 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nOvernight in the US\n\nUS stocks reversed early losses to close higher on Wednesday as investors digested an inflation report that showed consumer price increases ticked lower in August.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose more than 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the charge, rising almost than 2.2%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.2%, or more than 100 points. Nvidia (NVDA) led the rally in tech with shares soaring over 8% as CEO Jensen Huang spoke at a Goldman Sachs conference.\n\nInvestors had been looking to August's consumer price index to lift the uncertainty around the size of the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut in years. The data showed headline inflation slipping to a more than three-year low. But \"core\" prices, which strip out the more volatile costs of food and gas, climbed 0.3% over the prior month, above the 0.2% economists had expected.\n\nAfter a mixed monthly jobs report, the price data was expected to help settle the debate over whether to expect a 0.5% or 0.25% easing in the Fed's policy decision next week. And after the hotter-than-expected month-over-month increase for core inflation, traders are now favoring a smaller cut from the Fed at its meeting next week. Thu 12 September 2024 at 12:08 am GMT-7\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nGood morning!\n\nHello from London. Lucy Harley-McKeown here ready to bring you the markets news of the day. We're seeing green across stock market boards the world over (apart from in Japan, where red means up).\n\nQuarterly earnings are due from Adobe (ADBE) and Fevertree (FEVR.L).\n\nOn the economic calendar is the European Central Bank rate decision, expected at 1.15pm. The bloc is expected to cut rates to 4% from 4.25%. It's also jobs day in the US, with the data informing the Federal Reserve's next moves.\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn August 31, 2024, Federated Hermes, Inc., a prominent investment firm, executed a significant transaction involving the shares of Dynavax Technologies Corp (NASDAQ:DVAX). The firm reduced its holdings by 988,569 shares, resulting in a new total of 6,158,200 shares. This adjustment represents a -0.03% impact on their portfolio, with the shares traded at a price of $11.22 each. Following this transaction, the firm's position in DVAX now accounts for 4.70% of their total holdings, marking a strategic shift in their investment approach.\n\nInsight into Federated Hermes, Inc.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with DVAX.\n\nFederated Hermes, Inc., headquartered at 1001 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, is a key player in the investment sector, managing an equity portfolio worth $42.19 billion. The firm's investment philosophy emphasizes a diversified approach, focusing heavily on technology and healthcare sectors. Among its top holdings are influential companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Federated Hermes, Inc. Reduces Stake in Dynavax Technologies Corp\n\nAbout Dynavax Technologies Corp\n\nDynavax Technologies Corp, based in the USA, is a biopharmaceutical company known for its innovative work in the development of vaccines and therapies that harness the body's immune responses. Since its IPO on February 19, 2004, the company has focused on products like HEPLISAV-B, a hepatitis B vaccine, and its Toll-like Receptor Immune Modulation Platform. Despite being significantly overvalued with a GF Value of $8.13 and a current stock price of $10.91, Dynavax continues to play a crucial role in its industry segment. Federated Hermes, Inc. Reduces Stake in Dynavax Technologies Corp\n\nDynavax's Financial and Market Performance\n\nThe financial health of Dynavax is highlighted by a PE Ratio of 99.18, indicating profitability challenges. The company's Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) stand at 2.80% and 1.75% respectively. Despite a challenging year with a 24.13% decline in its stock price, Dynavax maintains a GF Score of 75, suggesting a potential for average future performance.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) The Most Buzzing Stock To Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nStock Market Volatility\n\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\n\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500’s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\n\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\n\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed’s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\n\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it’s only 1-2%, then that’s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\n\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the 10 most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) The Most Buzzing Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nVolume: 367.867 million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 345.252 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing, and networking solutions, and is majorly known for manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are essential for rendering graphics, but they’re also used in AI, machine learning, and data centers.\n\nRecently, Elon Musk announced that Colossal, an AI training system, had been brought online by his AI startup, xAI. The system is powered by 100,000 H100 GPUs made by NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). For comparison, Google’s AI model uses 90,000 GPUs while Meta’s uses 70,000. H200 and the rumored Blackwell-based GPUs are slowly replacing the H100 GPUs.\n\nMusk has already announced that Colossal would double in size by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months. He claims only 50,000 replacement H200 GPUs would achieve size doubling. The Blackwell chips are even faster and more efficient, the top-end capacity being 36% higher than the H200 and 66% higher in total bandwidth.\n\nIn FQ2 2025, the company recorded a year-over-year improvement of 122.40% in revenue. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45%  of data center revenue.\n\n179 hedge funds held the company’s shares. Fisher Asset Management is the biggest shareholder with shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30. In late August, management also approved a buyback of $50 billion in equity shares.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices impact the demand. The company’s future success depends on effective AI monetization. By the end of fiscal year 2025 and each year after, it aims to achieve and maintain 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia’s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of 10 most buzzing stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.\n\nView comments",

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price closed out the daily session up 8%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia stock gained ground in conjunction with a report from Semafor that the U.S. was considering lifting restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductors to Saudi Arabia. If so, it would open up a new market for the AI company.\n\nNvidia's valuation also got a significant boost thanks to comments made in a presentation by CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at the Communacopia and Technology Conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Huang stated that his company was continuing to see incredible levels of demand.\n\nHe also issued encouraging guidance for Blackwell, the company's next-generation processors. Huang said that Blackwell's manufacturing has already ramped up, the chips are set to begin shipping to customers in significant numbers in Q4, and demand among customers is very high.\n\nThe Nvidia CEO also said that his company was approaching its designs with fabrication versatility in mind. The company currently relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to manufacture its chip designs, but it says it's taking steps to ensure it can move to other fabs if necessary.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\n\nOn the heels of some recent volatility for the stock, Jensen Huang gave Nvidia investors a lot of reassuring news today. The report about Nvidia's chips potentially being greenlit for sale in Saudi Arabia also highlights untapped growth opportunities among government customers.\n\nNvidia has been serving up stellar sales and earnings growth that has powered incredible share price gains, but that's also raised questions among investors about how long the momentum can be sustained. Today's favorable news developments helped allay concerns and power big gains for the stock, and I think Nvidia still offers attractive upside at current prices.\n\nThe company continues to have a clear lead in the advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) space, and the long-term demand outlook for its GPUs and emerging technology and service offerings remains very favorable. Recent volatility for the stock highlights that expectations are very high, but the company looks poised to deliver another big leap forward in processing with its Blackwell chips -- and it could be laying the foundations for long-term dominance in the AI space.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller is one of the few billionaires who have been bullish on the AI megatrends right from the start. But that doesn’t mean he’d buy just anything AI the market is buying. After making huge profits from his bullish bet on Jensen Huang’s AI chips empire, he started cashing out of the company in the first quarter and by the end of the June quarter, his stake in the company was left at just over 200,000 shares.\n\nBack in May, Druckenmiller explained why he’s selling the hottest AI stock, saying he’s had a “hell of a run” and he now “just needs a break.”\n\nHowever, the billionaire said at the time that AI remains underhyped in the long term. Stanley Druckenmiller compared the internet revolution with the current AI boom, saying AI could “rhythm” with the internet and the real payoffs will come 4-5 years from now on. The Duquesne Capital founder, who closed his fund for outside investors and turned it into a family officer in 2011, said that the “incremental payoff” of AI investments is coming by the “day.”\n\nDuring the second quarter, Druckenmiller shook up his portfolio to buy and sell several famous as well as under-the-radar AI stocks. In this article, we will take a look at some of those.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 10 Stocks That Have Grabbed Stanley Druckenmiller’s Attention in 2022\n\nStan Druckenmiller\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Stake Value: $26,445,000 (-88% From the First Quarter)\n\nBillionaire Druckenmiller cut his stake in NVDA by 88% in the second quarter.\n\nOppenheimer Asset Management recently gave a Buy rating to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\n“Key positives for NVDA remain the stock’s bullish trend, high-momentum score, and portfolio tailwinds from a relatively strong Technology sector. In terms of trading, NVDA has inflected positively above the bullish slope of its 200-day average indicating a resumption of the stock’s uptrend, in our view,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, Aswath Damodaran, NYU Stern School of Business Professor of Finance, reiterated his NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) thesis on a latest program on CNBC, calling the stock overvalued.\n\nStory continues\n\n“NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an amazing company, great growth, amazing cash flow, superb margins, but you are paying a premium price even given all of those pluses,” Damodaran said.\n\nAsked what’d be a better buy than NVDA, Damodaran said AMZN is a better stock.\n\n“Given the earnings and their cash flows if I had to buy a stock now and you forced me to a buy a big tech, I’d rather own Amazon I’d buy Amazon than buy Nvidia right now,” Damodaran added.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were moving higher today on several news items, including a cooler-than-expected inflation report this morning, a well-received presentation at a Goldman Sachs conference this morning, and news that the federal government could allow it to export chips to Saudi Arabia. As a result, the stock closed up 8% on the news.\n\nChip stocks largely jumped as well on the inflation report, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF up 4.6% on the news, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.2%. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nFalling interest rates are good for Nvidia\n\nInvestors seemed unsure if the CPI report, which showed inflation rising just 2.5% year over year in August, was good news for stocks, but by the afternoon, the Nasdaq was soaring, paced by Nvidia.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates next week, but investors are unsure if it will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points. Ideally, interest rates will come down while the economy remains strong or even gets stronger. That would be the best scenario for Nvidia, as lower rates make growth stocks more valuable, and it should encourage borrowing for investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, meaning spending on Nvidia components.\n\nSpeaking at Goldman Sachs' Communacopia conference, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang didn't make any major news, but touted the company's technology and the future of generative AI, noting the company's advantages, including its software libraries for applications like autonomous driving and climate tech. He also added, \"Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people because it directly affects their revenue. It directly affects their competitiveness.\"\n\nFinally, according to a report from Semafor, the federal government is considering permitting Nvidia to export advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, which it would use to train advanced AI models. While Saudi Arabia isn't a huge market, the loosening of export rules would benefit Nvidia and could lead to other markets opening up.\n\nWill Nvidia keep gaining?\n\nTailwinds seem to be forming for the company, as falling interest rates will support investment and its valuation. It's also set to release the Blackwell platform in Q4, and its top customers, including tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet, have all said that investing in AI infrastructure is a top priority.\n\nEven after today's gains, Nvidia stock is still down 17% from its high in June, leaving room for more gains.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Best Cryptocurrency Stock To Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks.\n\nA Review of the Crypto World: Latest Updates\n\nCrypto has emerged as a major political issue in the US with the campaigns for election going on. Head of Firmwide research Galaxy Digital Alex Thorn called August a rough and seasonally bad week for Bitcoin. He mentioned how eight out of the eleven prior Augusts witnessed the major coin trading down. However, political events have also played a role in the crypto landscape.\n\nIn Thorn's opinion, most people view Trump’s victory as bullish for the crypto market. Trump who is now running for President brought the hopes of the crypto world higher by promising to deliver a plan to make the United States the ‘crypto capital of the planet’. Crypto became an even hotter topic as Kamala Haris simultaneously supported policies for the expansion of the industry. In the opinion of Thorn, most people view Trump’s victory as bullish for the crypto market. He predicts crypto will run quite higher if Trump ends up winning the election based on an anticipated easing of the regulations. On the other hand, he expects the victory of Harris to be more neutral even for the industry since those advising her belong to the Biden administration on crypto policy.\n\nLooking forward to September which is a seasonally weak month for crypto too, the next months including October, November, and December are crypto's most bullish months based on the seasonality factor. Regardless of the highly awaited Fed interest rate cuts just ahead of us, the crypto market investors still remain concerned as JPMorgan’s Head of Global and European Equity Strategy dismissed the potential of a crypto bull market. While September has been a historically worst month for US stocks, the upcoming rate cut might be an outlier in history.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Anthony Pompliano, Professional Capital Management CEO, talked about the recent price moves in Bitcoin. The German government offloading Bitcoin through as many exchanges and the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox unloading coins onto the market are two important events defining this supply. Pompliano refers to Bitcoin as really illiquid with many Bitcoin holders having a long-term view of it. At the start of 2024, the Bitcoin amount that had not moved in more than a year was over 70%. Some of it started to get distributed as prices rose, as expected in a bull market. Although Pompliano expects this percentage to drop to 50% to 55% but still at least half of the Bitcoin would still be in the hands of people who have an over 10-year time horizon. Thus, the question revolves around whether these hands are strong enough to outlast the aforementioned two events. Pompliano finally states time as the only catalyst for Bitcoin rather than a pro-crypto candidate in the upcoming US elections. While the summer season is a bit slow, prices typically go back up in September and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 20 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a preliminary list of 40 companies involved in the crypto space. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 20 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 20 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders they have, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializes in products and platforms for the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets. The chip maker is known for its GPU technology which is utilized in crypto mining and makes it an important company in the crypto space.\n\nThe recent development from NVIDIA made the firm outshine as it unveiled the Blackwell GPU architecture at NVIDIA GTC 2024. Blackwell is the largest GPU ever built with 208 billion transistors which is more than 2.5 times the amount of transistors in NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, thereby unlocking a new era of accelerated computing and generative AI. While customers are currently gearing up to adopt Blackwell which has been widely sampled, the firm expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in Q4.\n\nFor the second quarter ended July 28, NVIDIA reported a record quarterly revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year-over-year, and well above the firm’s outlook of $28 billion. Data Center revenue was also at a record $26.3 billion, increasing by 154% as compared to the prior year. This increase was attributable to the strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and its networking platforms. Simultaneously, compute revenue increased by more than 2.5 times and networking revenue rose by more than 2 times relative to 2023.\n\nThe company also expects its sovereign AI revenue to hit low-double-digit billions this year, fueled by AI-powered chatbots and generative AI copilots. It is working with many Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across geographies and industries. An example of this is SAP using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. During the recent quarter, the company made a major stride in enterprise AI by introducing a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is held by 179 hedge funds, compared to 186 funds in the prior quarter. Citadel Investment Group is the dominant shareholder in the company with a position worth $18 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 6.8% in the afternoon session after markets rebounded (Nasdaq up 1.8%, S&P 500 up 0.8%) after shaking off the initial negative reaction to the August inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of August 2024 came in line with expectations, growing 0.2% month on month.\n\nA concerning aspect of the report lies in the core CPI (which excludes food and energy prices), which revealed a 0.3% increase from the previous month, slightly exceeding the expected 0.2%. Despite this, annual inflation seemed to be easing, rising by 2.5%, the lowest level since February 2021. The improved market sentiment suggests investors still very strongly believe that the Fed will cut rates later this month.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. The result of lower interest rates, all else equal, is higher stock valuations. This is especially true for higher-growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, where the current value depends more on cash flows many years out in the future.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia’s shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 23 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today’s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company dropped 5.9% as market volatility increased (Nasdaq down 2.5%, S&P 500 down 1.5%) following the underwhelming jobs report, which raised more questions about the health of the economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm Payrolls for the month of August 2024 revealed that the US economy added 142,000 jobs. While the growth represented a significant improvement from the previous month (+89k additions), it fell below the 161,000 consensus forecast.\n\nIn addition, the unemployment rate clocked in at 4.2%, roughly in line with expectations. Following the report, the consensus expectation continued to point to a higher probability of a 25 basis points (0.25%) rate cut during the September 2024 Fed policy meeting.\n\nOverall, the report offered limited clarity on how the new data might influence the Fed's policy decisions in the coming months, as it presented arguments that could support both bullish and bearish perspectives.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is up 143% since the beginning of the year, but at $116.83 per share it is still trading 13.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $25,348.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "CEO Jensen Huang Sells Chunk of NVIDIA Stock, But Why You Shouldn't",
        "content": "Wall Street darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock’s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA’s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let’s have a look –\n\nNVIDIA Stock – CEO Sells Shares, Volatility Intensifies\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker’s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\n\nOn Friday, NVIDIA’s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world’s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\n\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run.  Here are the positive reasons –\n\nNVIDIA’s Blackwell Chip to be a Game Changer\n\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock’s 2025 results.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Meta Platforms, Inc. META have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\n\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell’s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\n\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA’s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures — Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeither NVIDIA Stock Nor AI is in a Bubble\n\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies’ shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\n\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company’s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company’s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\n\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry’s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company’s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA’s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry’s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\n2 More Reasons to be Bullish on the NVIDIA Stock\n\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA’s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\n\nNVIDIA’s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVDA Shares\n\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA’s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\n\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock’s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts’ highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: 'Everybody is counting on us'",
        "content": "The biggest draw at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference this week?\n\nNvidia (NVDA) cofounder Jensen Huang.\n\nInvestors and journalists lined up more than an hour before the session just to catch a glimpse of one of the world's most sought after CEOs. Huang told the audience though generative AI is still in its early days, it’ll expand beyond data centers.\n\n“Now what’s amazing is, so the first trillion dollars of data centers is going to get accelerated and invented this new type of software called generative AI. Generative AI is not just a tool, it’s a skill,\" Huang told Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"For the first time we’re going to create skills that augment people.”\n\nFollowing Nvidia's brutal selloff last week, Huang's keynote was seen as an opportunity to calm investors nerves.\n\n“The infrastructure players, like ourselves, and all the cloud service providers, put the infrastructure in the cloud so that developers can use these machines to train the models and fine tune the models, guardrail the models,” Huang said. “And the return on that is just fantastic.”\n\nAccording to Huang, for every dollar a cloud service provider spend with Nvidia, it translates to $5 worth of rentals.\n\n“I think the days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,” Huang said. “The idea that every one of our software engineers will essentially have companion digital engineers 24/7 - that’s the future.”\n\nFor example Huang shared that Nvidia has 32,000 employees, who will be supplemented by “hopefully 100x more digital engineers” in the near future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking on stage with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference in San Francisco.\n\nNvidia servers \"look expensive, and it could be a couple of million dollars per rack, but it replaces thousands of nodes,\" Huang said. \"The amazing thing is, the cables of connecting old, general purpose computing systems cost more than replacing all of those and densifying into one rack.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and OpenAI use Nvidia’s GPUs. Despite the tech giant reporting $30 billion in Q2 revenue, its stock fell by more than $200 billion on the same day.\n\nLast week, Nvidia shed another $400 billion in market value following a Bloomberg report that the Department of Justice subpoenaed the company as part of an antitrust investigation. Nvidia denied the report.\n\n“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” the company said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang was not asked about the Bloomberg report on Wednesday. And despite the recent selloff, Nvidia shares are up nearly 150% in the last 12 months.\n\nHuang also said while training AI models is resource intensive, it pays off in the long run.\n\n“One of the takeaways there is AI isn’t just about training the model, of course that’s just the first step,” he said. “It’s about using the model. And so when you use the model you save enormous amounts of time — processing time.”\n\nSolomon ended the conversation asking Huang about his biggest worry. Huang discussed how crucial Nvidia's chips are to its clients.\n\n“We have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us,” Huang said. “Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people. Because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.”\n\nHowever, Huang said it’s amazing to watch the AI his company uses to design the chips. “The part of that that is really intense is just the world on our shoulders,” Huang said. “Less sleep is fine. Three solid hours is all we need.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "content": "Stocks Fall As Inflation Data Chills Rate-Cut Excitement, Chipmakers, Solar Sector Soar On Harris-Linked Boost: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nWall Street witnessed a broad sell-off on Wednesday, except for the tech sector, as investor optimism over disinflation progress cooled following a mixed August inflation report.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.5% year-over-year, slightly below the 2.6% estimate and down from July’s 2.9%, marking the slowest pace of inflation since February 2021. The bulk of this decline came from energy-related categories.\n\nHowever, core inflation — excluding the more volatile components like food and energy — rose 0.3% month-over-month, surpassing expectations of 0.2%. The annual core CPI remained at 3.2%, reflecting persistent inflation in service-related sectors.\n\nA key driver of inflation continues to be shelter costs, which rose 0.5% from the previous month—the sharpest increase since January — and account for nearly a third of the total CPI.\n\nThe report dashed hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut in the upcoming meeting. Market expectations for a 50-basis-point cut plummeted to just 13%, down from 34% the day before, as per CME FedWatch.\n\nThe inflation data gave the U.S. dollar a lift and nudged Treasury yields higher across the board. Sectors most sensitive to interest rates, such as real estate, materials and financials, led the sell-off.\n\nIn contrast, tech stocks defied the broader market slump, driven by strong gains in the semiconductor space.\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged 4.5%, buoyed by the market's reaction to the latest U.S. presidential debate between Vice President KamalaHarris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe two candidates engaged in a back-and-forth about tariffs on goods, which would impact inflation and the chipmaking industry.\n\nSolar stocks also rallied, with the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSE:TAN) jumping over 4%, as the prospect of a Harris administration increased optimism for renewable energy policies.First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) was the top performer within the industry, jumping over 12%.\n\nElsewhere, gold remained flat, while oil prices rebounded over 2% after Tuesday’s sell-off. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) dropped more than 2%.\n\nWednesday’s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Nasdaq 100 18,865.96 0.2% S&P 500 5,476.37 -0.3% Russell 2000 2,092.21 -0.5% Dow Jones 40,436.47 -0.7%\n\nUpdated at 12:50 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.3% lower to $547.10. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.7% to $405.59. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) inched 0.2% higher to $459.93. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) fell 0.4% to $207.30. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) outperformed, up 0.9%.

Deservedly so. It’s tense. We’re trying to do the best we can.”\n\nHuang’s company is experiencing strong demand for its latest generation of chips, called Blackwell, he told the audience. The Santa Clara, California-based business outsources the physical production of its hardware, and Nvidia’s suppliers are doing their best to catch up, and are making progress, he said.\n\nNvidia leans heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for production of its most important chips and does so because that company is the best in its field by a large margin, he said. But geopolitical tension has raised risks. China sees TSMC’s home island as a rogue province, stoking concerns that it might try to reclaim the territory. That could potentially cut off Nvidia from the key supplier.\n\nHuang said he develops much of the company’s technology in-house and that should allow Nvidia to switch orders to alternative suppliers. Still, such a change would likely result in a reduction in quality of his chips, he said.\n\nTSMC’s “agility and their capability to respond to our needs is just incredible,” he said. “And so we use them because they’re great, but if necessary, of course, we can always bring up others.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson Says the AI Theme Is ‘Overcooked’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence boom that powered the S&P 500 Index to record highs earlier this year is fizzling out, so the stock market needs a new catalyst if the rally is going to resume, according to Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus\n\nWhile AI could very well transform productivity over time, investors who bid up equities on its potential in the short-term were premature, the bank’s chief US equity strategist said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Now it’s showing up in struggling chip stocks, and not just poster child Nvidia Corp.’s recent swings, he added. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 8.5% this month.\n\nRead: Risk-On Momentum in Stocks Succumbs to Mounting Growth Worries\n\n“The AI dream — a little bit of that luster has come off,” he said. “We just got overcooked on the whole AI theme. It doesn’t mean it’s over.”\n\nInvestors have been reducing their exposure to technology high-flyers after snapping them up for much of the year. With the Federal Reserve prepared to start cutting interest rates as soon as next week, they’re shifting to other pockets of the market as they gauge the health of the US economy.\n\nWilson reiterated his preference for quality defensive stocks, recommending areas such as utilities, consumer staples, and health care as the fervor around chipmakers fades, at least temporarily. Investors are likely to hide out in those sectors until they get the “next thing, whether it is a bad outcome or a positive outcome,” he said.\n\nUS stocks fell Tuesday morning after a key measure of inflation rose more than expected in August, raising concerns that the Fed won’t cut rates as much as traders are hoping. The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% from July and 3.2% from a year ago.\n\nBefore the report was released, Wilson said that the figure needed to “thread the needle,” meaning a higher-than-anticipated number could leave the Fed behind the curve and a substantial drop in inflation would harm corporate pricing power.\n\nThe strategist warned that front-loading interest rate cuts with a 50-basis-point reduction at this meeting “materially” reduces the chances of a soft landing. Some traders had been speculating that policymakers will employ a supersized cut right out of the gate, but following the higher CPI print they’ve backed off and largely cemented odds of a quarter-point reduction.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bigger wild card during the Fed’s meeting next week, according to Wilson, is whether officials speak more aggressively about ending quantitative tightening quickly or offer other provisions to provide liquidity. That could surprise markets and serve as a “bull case” for stocks, he said.\n\nIn early July, Wilson correctly warned that the market is due for a substantial pullback due to heightened uncertainty around Fed policy, corporate earnings and the US election. Less than a month later, the S&P 500 tumbled 8.5% from its peak to its August low. However, the strategist also predicted a stock-market rout last year that failed to materialize.\n\nLooking at the election, Wilson thinks that in a soft landing scenario former president Donald Trump’s growth policies are likely good for stocks and bad for bonds.\n\n“I do think the stock market is pro-Trump,” he said. “The stock market has traded better when his odds go up, and vise versa.”\n\n--With assistance from Matt Turner, Annmarie Hordern, Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's 1 Vanguard ETF I'm Loading Up On and 1 I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "For the most part, if something can make my life easier, I will embrace it. That goes for house chores, traveling, investing, and many other things. One thing that has made investing much simpler and more straightforward is using exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nWhat used to take a large number of investments and lots of time can now essentially be done with a handful of investments. The stock market is full of thousands of ETFs, each with its own focus and value proposition. However, not all ETFs make sense for everyone. The key is finding the ETFs that match your investment style, goals, and risk tolerance.\n\nThe following two ETFs represent both ends of the spectrum for me -- one I regularly invest in, and one I've been avoiding like the plague. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nI'm loading up on this S&P 500 ETF\n\nI consider one ETF the foundation of my stock portfolio: The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). It was one of my first investments and will likely always be my largest holding. The S&P 500 index, which this ETF tracks, is comprised of the 500 largest companies on the U.S. market, acting as a de facto representation of the U.S. economy. The economy and the S&P 500 don't correlate directly, but they tend to move in the same direction long term.\n\nFor perspective, S&P 500 companies account for around 50% of U.S. corporations' total profits. Those companies matter a lot, and that's why I trust putting a sizable portion of my investments in this ETF and relying on the long-term growth of the U.S. economy.\n\nHistory has shown that leaning on an S&P 500 ETF is the right move for most people. Since it was created in September 2010, this ETF has averaged over 14% annual total returns. Every $1,000 invested then would be worth over $6,300 today. VOO Total Return Price Chart\n\nThere are no guarantees in the stock market. However, some investments have stood the test of time. This ETF falls into that category, which is why I'm comfortable using dollar-cost averaging and buying shares every two weeks. It takes a lot of the \"work\" out of investing.\n\nThe one ETF I'm avoiding right now\n\nIt pains me to say it, but the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) is the ETF I'm currently avoiding. It pains me because I love tech stocks, and the information technology (tech) sector has easily been the most rewarding over the last decade.\n\nThis ETF has even considerably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade, returning over 425% compared to the index's 170%. That lets you know underperformance isn't the issue. The issue is how much this 318-stock ETF relies today on just three companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany Percentage of ETF Apple 17.21% Microsoft 15.83% Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) 14.07%\n\nData source: Vanguard. Percentages as of July 31.\n\nTo be fair, these three companies are some of the best in the world. Still, three companies making up over 47% of the ETF is risky. It's especially risky at a time when some experts (I use that term loosely) would agree that the stock market is at an elevated risk of a correction.\n\nFor perspective, let's look at the four-day workweek after Labor Day, when all three companies finished the week down. VGT Chart\n\nYou can't fully blame these three companies for the ETF's drop, but you can definitely put a lot of the blame on them, since they make up almost half of the fund. The spark they give the ETF can also be the downer when things aren't going well. And considering Nvidia lost over $400 billion from its market value in the above week -- the most lost in a week by any company in U.S. history -- things don't always go well for even the best companies.\n\nThe same companies, with much less risk\n\nI'm a fan of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. This isn't a direct knock on them, but more so on the high concentration of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. Many of its top holdings are also in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, but with much less exposure and dependence.\n\nSince the S&P 500 is the foundation of my stock portfolio, I try to be mindful of companies that overlap between ETFs. The tech sector already makes up over 31% of the S&P 500, with Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia being the top three holdings. Adding a tech-specific ETF could make it a little too tech-leaning for my personal preference.\n\nI'd much rather depend on broader economic growth than on sector-specific growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock May Tumble in the Remainder of 2024",
        "content": "Perhaps no stock has risen more so fast than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At one point, it was up by about 1,000% in less than two years, briefly taking its market cap north of $3.2 trillion before it pulled back.\n\nHowever, the run-up in the company's stock was so extreme that even its stellar earnings report for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 31) failed to prevent a significant sell-off in its stock. Between the company's likely overvaluation and a momentum shift, investors should probably avoid the semiconductor stock for the remainder of 2024.\n\nThe state of Nvidia\n\nIn light of the recent pullback, investors need to exercise some perspective. The scorching demand for AI chips and Nvidia's considerable lead in this niche of the chip industry arguably make it the premier semiconductor stock.\n\nThe growth in the AI chip market has been so explosive that Allied Market Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% through 2032. This is far above the 6% CAGR that Allied forecast for the overall chip industry through 2031.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia appears poised to begin shipping its next-generation AI chip Blackwell in the fourth quarter. This should help it maintain its market lead as its competitors struggle to catch up to the chip giant.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's technical lead, current shareholders should probably stay in the stock because it will likely remain a long-term winner. In time, it may even replace the struggling Intel as a Dow 30 stock.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nDespite Nvidia's huge potential, the short-term outlook for its stock looks increasingly bleak. Amid several quarters of triple-digit revenue growth, the company eventually fell short of increasingly elevated expectations. Consequently, the stock is down by about 25% from its 52-week high.\n\nAdmittedly, its gains may have appeared justified from the perspective of its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). At just 48 times earnings, Nvidia may look undervalued when considering the company's triple-digit percentage revenue and earnings growth.\n\nStill, the other metrics may have left investors questioning Nvidia's current price. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio had exceeded 40 as recently as July, and the current sales multiple of about 27 makes it expensive by just about any measure.\n\nAlso, its valuation looks more stratospheric when taking into account its price-to-book value ratio of 43. With AMD and Qualcomm selling at a respective 4 times and 7 times book value, Nvidia may have trouble justifying its huge premium.\n\nMoreover, investors tend to sour on stocks with slowing growth, even when the growth rate is robust. This may not be fair, but the fact is that triple-digit growth numbers are unsustainable over the long term. Also, customers are likely to turn to the company's competitors' slower but available AI chips as Nvidia struggles to meet demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, investors need to keep the history of Nvidia stock in mind. Despite the gains of more than 20,000% during the past 10 years, the stock has also fallen by more than 50% twice during that period. NVDA Chart\n\nSuch sell-offs tend to occur because the chip industry and its stocks move in cycles. While the upward moves in this stock have handsomely rewarded shareholders, they have also had to endure brutal sell-offs. With Nvidia likely in a bear phase now, investors may want to wait until 2025 before they consider adding shares.\n\nNvidia stock's future\n\nGiven Nvidia's momentum and its high valuations, investors should probably refrain from adding the company's shares in the last months of 2024. Admittedly, the bull market in AI chips is likely not over, and current shareholders should benefit in the long term by staying in the stock.\n\nNonetheless, both investor expectations and the stock price appear to have become too detached from the fundamentals. Thus, investors should probably wait a few months before adding to positions in Nvidia stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Reasons to Sell Nvidia Stock (and 1 Reason to Buy)",
        "content": "With shares down roughly 15% since the company's second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 8, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) legendary bull run might be in trouble. While operational results remain as strong as ever, investors may be growing concerned about the sustainability of Nvidia's business model and the artificial intelligence (AI) industry as a whole. Let's discuss two reasons to consider selling the stock and one reason to buy the dip.\n\nNvidia's margins look unsustainable\n\nGross profit margin compares a company's revenue to the direct production costs of selling its goods or services before overhead expenses like office salaries, advertising, or research. Typically, this metric favors software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies that don't sell physical products. But with a gross margin of 75%, Nvidia bucks the trend.\n\nFor context, Microsoft, the biggest SaaS company in the world, has a gross margin of just under 70%, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, stands at 57%. Nvidia is now selling physical hardware at a greater markup than others can sell digital services. And this dynamic doesn't look natural or sustainable over the long term.\n\nGenerally, free markets tend to compete away excess profitability. And if that doesn't work, governments tend to get involved.\n\nThis month, Bloomberg News reported that the Department of Justice subpoenaed Nvidia in an \"escalating antitrust probe\" related to its dominant position in the market for AI processors.The report claims that officials suspect the company may be making it harder for clients to use other suppliers and penalizing them if they do.\n\nNvidia denies the report and claims that its high market share (estimated at 88%) stems from its product's better speed and quality. Either way, Nvidia's business practices (legal or not) may be starting to attract the wrong sort of attention. And investors should take notice.\n\nThe software side of the industry isn't carrying its weight\n\nFor better or worse, Nvidia has managed to keep competition at bay within the market for AI-capable hardware. That said, the company can't control the consumer-facing software side of the industry, where cracks are beginning to show in the long-term thesis.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the AI boom may be ending, with several high-profile start-ups such as Inflection AI, Stability AI, and Anthropic generating massive losses and/or downsizing their operations. Cloud computing giants like Google or Amazon's AWS fare better by targeting the infrastructure side of the opportunity (renting out computing power). But if the start-ups fail, data center demand could also nosedive.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of Nvidia's top customers, such as Meta Platforms, don't even expect to make money from their AI investment anytime soon.\n\nMeta, which is known for its open-sourcelarge language model Llama, is simply trying to stay at the leading edge of the technology. But while this sounds great in theory, it is reminiscent of its failed pivot to the metaverse in 2021 -- a money-burning experiment that was eventually shelved amid shareholder backlash.\n\nShareholders might tolerate companies spending billions on experimental technologies when the economy is buoyant. However, if macroeconomic conditions tighten, managerial teams will be pressured to fall back.\n\nGenerative AI might only be the beginning for Nvidia\n\nDespite all these challenges, Nvidia is not a bad company. The chipmaker produces cutting-edge hardware that could quickly find new use cases, even if generative AI demand fades. The most promising opportunity could be self-driving cars, which analysts at McKinsey think could be worth up to $400 billion in revenue by 2035.\n\nRobotics, augmented reality, and even the metaverse could also support demand for Nvidia's hardware for decades to come.\n\nAt the end of the day, long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out the market's volatility and noise -- allowing time for a company's thesis to play out. Nvidia bulls might be willing to overlook some of the chipmaker's near-term challenges in favor of the bigger picture.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "After Nvidia's $279 Billion Loss in Market Value, Is the Stock a Buy -- or One to Avoid?",
        "content": "We've gotten used to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) reaching \"firsts\" or records -- the company repeatedly has launched the world's fastest artificial intelligence (AI) chip yet and reported its highest quarterly revenue ever. Nvidia's standout moments have been very positive. But in recent days, the situation hasn't been as bright.\n\nAs the general market tumbled, so did Nvidia. The star AI stock has dropped 12% since the start of the month, and last week in just one day it lost $279 billion in market value. That's the biggest-ever one-day loss in market capitalization for a U.S. company. Though this has left Nvidia significantly cheaper than it was earlier this year -- trading at 36x forward earnings estimates instead of 50x -- you still may be wondering what to do about the stock right now. Has it permanently lost momentum, making it one to avoid, or is Nvidia a buy on the dip? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's GPUs\n\nFirst, let's talk about how Nvidia became such a show-stopping stock, one that most investors have been closely watching. The company initially specialized in making its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the video game industry, but when it became clear these chips could be game-changers in other industries, Nvidia introduced a platform to make that possible.\n\nThe company released CUDA, a parallel computing platform that brought the GPU into many areas, including AI. Since, Nvidia's data center growth has taken off, resulting in record quarterly revenue that has surpassed the company's annual revenue just a few years ago. Nvidia also is highly profitable and boasts a gross margin of more than 70%. The company forecasts gross margin in the mid-70s for the full year.\n\nOf course, Nvidia faces competition from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, and these players are producing better and better chips -- and offer them for a lower price. Though these products clearly will gain more and more users, I don't believe this will knock Nvidia out of its top spot. And this is due to Nvidia's innovation strengths.\n\nThe Blackwell launch\n\nThe company offers the best chip around right now -- and it promises to update its chips on an annual basis. This will make it very difficult for another player to get ahead. Nvidia right now is preparing for the launch of a particularly important platform, its new Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip yet. The company plans a ramp of Blackwell in the fourth quarter and is predicting billions of dollars in revenue during that period.\n\nNow, let's return to the idea of Nvidia's chips being more expensive than rival products. As mentioned, some customers will turn to those rivals. But Nvidia says that those using its latest GPUs will gain in efficiency and over time this will lower their total cost of ownership. So, by spending more now, customers can save over the long run. This is a point that could prompt certain customers to continue choosing Nvidia.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that Nvidia doesn't sell only chips, but instead offers customers an entire suite of AI products and services -- and these are all available through every public cloud. So, it's very easy for customers to find Nvidia.\n\nNvidia faces this challenge\n\nThe one challenge Nvidia faces in the coming months is delivering these products to customers in a timely manner. Demand for Blackwell, for example, is exceeding supply, and Nvidia predicts this will continue. Some potential customers who don't want to wait could turn to other companies for their AI projects. This could weigh on growth and eventually on stock performance. On top of this, any disappointment in Nvidia's earnings reports could hurt investor sentiment since investors have gotten used to ongoing outsized performance from this top AI company.\n\nSo, considering all of this, and Nvidia's recent lackluster stock performance, is Nvidia a buy or a stock to avoid? For investors looking for a quick gain, Nvidia may not deliver it these days. Uncertainties about the general economic backdrop are weighing on growth companies such as Nvidia -- and this could continue. Also, as mentioned, investors expect a lot of Nvidia -- and if the company doesn't immediately deliver, the stock could suffer.\n\nBut I consider these near-term problems, and they don't change Nvidia's fantastic long-term story. That's why I see Nvidia's recent dip as a not-to-be-missed opportunity to scoop up shares of this AI giant for a bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's $50 Billion Share Buyback Is the Ultimate Smoke-and-Mirrors Campaign",
        "content": "For the better part of two years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. The prospect of AI-driven software and systems learning without human intervention gives this technology broad-reaching utility in almost every sector and industry.\n\nThough we've seen no shortage of next-big-thing trends come and go on Wall Street since the advent of the internet three decades ago, none have offered as large of an addressable market as artificial intelligence. Based on a report issued by researchers at PwC, AI is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030.\n\nWhile a number of stocks have soared on the heels of the AI revolution, no company has benefited more than semiconductor goliath Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is on the cutting edge of Wall Street's hottest trend\n\nIn the blink of an eye, Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) became the undisputed top choice by businesses looking run generative AI solutions and train large language models. Nvidia's H100 chip has been backlogged due to excess demand, while its successor chip, Blackwell, is estimated to be sold out well into 2025. Blackwell is set to make its debut during the first quarter of next year.\n\nThe beauty of AI-GPU demand overwhelming supply is that it puts the ball completely in Nvidia's court when it comes to pricing power. Nvidia's GPU hardware has consistently been priced at a 100% to 300% premium to competing chips -- and businesses are eagerly lining up to pay this higher price. Over the last six quarters, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin has expanded by more than 10 percentage points, largely thanks to this otherworldly pricing power.\n\nDuring the fiscal second quarter of 2025 (ended July 28), Nvidia delivered sales growth of 122% and reported just a hair over $30 billion in sales. For some context on just how quickly Nvidia has ramped its sales, it generated a little north of $6 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nBut while it's looked every bit like Wall Street's textbook growth stock, Nvidia threw the ultimate smoke-and-mirrors curveball to investors with one aspect of its latest report.\n\nNvidia's $50 billion share buyback is nothing more than a smoke-and-mirrors campaign\n\nWith professional and everyday investors looking for Nvidia to report blowout second-quarter sales growth and hype up its future hardware and software offerings -- the company's CUDA software toolkit has played a key role in keeping enterprise clients loyal to its AI-GPUs -- Nvidia delivered the news that its board had approved a $50 billion share repurchasing program. This comes atop the $7.5 billion remaining from a previously announced buyback allotment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe purpose of buyback programs is to signal to investors that a company's board believes its stock is being undervalued by Wall Street and investors.\n\nFurthermore, buying back stock has the ability to reduce a company's outstanding share count, which can provide an upward lift to earnings per share (EPS). In other words, it can make a stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nHowever, devoting up to $50 billion to a buyback program isn't something you'd expect from a hypergrowth company that's expected to spend a small fortune on researching and developing new products and services tied to the AI revolution.\n\nOne reason this is a complete smoke-and-mirrors move is because the company is dangling the prospect of repurchasing an additional $50 billion worth of its stock at a time when insiders are selling their shares at a historic pace. Since the midpoint of June, CEO Jensen Huang has disposed of around $600 million worth of his company's stock. Net insider selling activity has topped $1.6 billion over the trailing-12-month period.\n\nTo add to the above, no insider has purchased a single share of their company's stock on the open market since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress bought 200 shares in (wait for it...) December 2020! NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nIf this isn't egregious enough, Nvidia is attempting to signal that its stock is undervalued at a time when its shares are historically pricey, relative to its trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.\n\nThroughout history, you can count on one hand how many times we've witnessed market-leading companies approach a TTM P/S ratio of 40. The last time this occurred, both Amazon and Cisco Systems went on to lose around 90% of their respective value following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nDangling the carrot of buybacks at a time when Nvidia's valuation is historically expensive is the ultimate smoke-and-mirrors campaign. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory would like a word, too\n\nLooking beyond Nvidia's head-scratching share repurchase announcement, investors should also note the warning history provides when it comes to next-big-thing innovations, technologies, and trends.\n\nWhile there's no question that big dollar figures tied to large addressable markets can lead to emotion-driven euphoria on Wall Street, history has repeatedly shown that every highly touted innovation, technology, and trend over the last 30 years has, eventually, navigated its way through an early stage bubble.\n\nThe catalyst for this bubble is investors who consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of next-big-thing trends. Although artificial intelligence has a promising future, the simple fact that most businesses lack a well-defined game plan to grow their sales and increase their profits is a glaring warning that investor expectations are outpacing reality.\n\nHistory also tells us that every game-changing technology has needed time to mature. It took more than a half-decade for business-to-business commerce to find its footing following the proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s. It's going to take time for businesses to figure out what they have with AI and how to best utilize the technology to meet the needs of their customers.\n\nLong story short, a $50 billion share repurchase program doesn't hide the fact that Nvidia's insiders are big-time sellers, the stock is historically pricey, and no highly touted innovation has escaped an early innings bubble for three decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 11, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights AT&T T, Altria MO, Nvidia NVDA, Oracle ORCL and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nWill Stocks Finish 2024 Strong? Bull vs. Bear Case\n\nWill Stocks Be Higher into 2025?\n\nWall Street is complex, constantly changing, and challenging to predict. For these reasons, savvy investors understand that striving to lay out the bull and bear cases in a sober, unbiased fashion is important. However, simply laying out the bull and bear case is far from a panacea, and some of the best and brightest investors understand the power of flexibility:\n\n“You adapt, evolve, compete, or die.”~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\n“You always need to be flexible, bending like a tree in the wind.” ~William O’Neil\n\n“I change my mind a lot. I can be in love with something on Friday and short it on Wednesday.”~ Stanley Druckenmiller\n\nToday’s commentary will analyze five critical data points in the current market with an “if, then” mindset.\n\nWhat Rate Cuts Mean for the Market\n\nThe Federal Reserve and monetary policy laid out by Chairman Jerome Powell is an integral market piece to understand. The Fed’s policy drives liquidity, and liquidity drives equities. Powell recently confirmed that the Fed will cut rates this month.\n\nWill the Fed Cut Interest Rates by .25 or .5?\n\nThe first rate cut after a hiking cycle is typically bullish for equities. The Fed has cut interest rates 14 times since 1929. Of the 14 rate cuts, 12 instances resulted in the S&P 500 Index being higher a year after the first rate cut.\n\nHowever, the data says that investors should be concerned if the Fed shows panic and starts a rate cutting cycle with a .50% cut rather than a .25% cut. In both years the market was lower one year after the first cut (2001,2007), the Fed started with a 50bps cut.\n\nThough the jobs market is showing signs of softening, the CME FedWatch Tool gives the odds of a .25% rate cut at 71% and a .5% cut at only 29%.\n\n200-Day Has Contained Tech Rally\n\nThough value stocks like AT&T and Altria have outperformed recently, theNasdaq 100 ETFand big tech stocks like Nvidia, Oracle and Microsoft have led the market.Because of this, market technicians should focus on QQQ.QQQ has held the 200-day moving average or the 40-week MA since March 2023. The analysis is simple: if QQQ continues to tend above the line it is bullish; below the line is bearish.\n\nMarket Cycle Analysis\n\nAccording to InvesTech Research, the average bull market since the early 1930s has lasted nearly four years. Considering that the last bear market ended in late 2022, U.S. equities have ample runway into 2026 based on this metric.\n\nStory continues\n\nVolatility Spikes Coincide with Generational Bottoms\n\nThe Volatility Index (VIX) is a fear gauge that displays Wall Street’s expectations for market turmoil. Spikes above $60 are very extreme and have only occurred three times in the past 30 years: October 2008 during The Global Financial Crisis, March 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the beginning of last month when the “Yen Carry” unwound.\n\nIn each spike above $60, stocks staged generational bottoms and were much higher a year later.\n\nSeptember Pullbacks are Normal\n\nMarkets have retreated for four straight Decembers.\n\nThis September is no different. Nevertheless, September weakness has not led to a major correction in the past few years. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the S&P 500 Index finished the year higher than the start of September.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors should be flexible and keep an open mind about the market. Current metrics favor a continued bull market, but savvy investors prepare for either outcome.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar in Q4",
        "content": "Has Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) finally run out of earnings surprises?\n\nThe high-flying AI chip superstar seemed to run out of gas in the fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report it released on Aug. 28. While the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, the differences were narrower than investors were used to, and guidance was also less impressive than some had hoped.\n\nAdditionally, the company reported its first sequential decline in gross margin since demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) surged following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a sign the chipmaker's profitability has peaked.\n\nSince then, Nvidia has continued to pull back, falling Tuesday on a report it was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice as part of an antitrust investigation. The company later said it had not received a subpoena.\n\nNonetheless, as of its close on Sept. 6, the stock was down 18% from where it was trading before the earnings report came out.\n\nThat sets up a potential buying opportunity for investors as the stock is now about as cheap as it's been (on a valuation basis) since the AI boom began, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 49.\n\nFor investors considering buying the dip on Nvidia, the AI stock is well-positioned to recoup its recent losses in the fourth quarter and move higher. Let's take a look at a few reasons why. Image source: Nvidia.\n\n1. The Blackwell launch could be huge\n\nThe launch of Nvidia's new Blackwell platform has been eagerly awaited since the company announced it in March at its GTC conference.\n\nThe new GPU ecosystem has been delayed about three months due to a design flaw, but it's expected to be ready to go in the fourth quarter. According to Nvidia, Blackwell is able to run generative AI programs and massive large language models at up to 25 times less cost and energy requirements than the earlier Hopper model. That could be a game-changer for the AI industry in the wide range of companies depending on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nCFO Colette Kress told investors on the recent earnings call, \"Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\"\n\nThe launch of the platform should support the company's growth and margins, and a successful rollout is likely to lift the stock as well.\n\nInvestors will be closely watching management's guidance when the company reports its fiscal third-quarter earnings in November for signs of Blackwell's impact.\n\n2. Falling interest rates should be a tailwind\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates at its meeting later this month, and rate cuts are likely to fuel gains for Nvidia and much of the stock market. Lower interest rates will encourage more consumer spending and business investment, and they tend to favor growth stocks like Nvidia as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere has already been evidence of this as Nvidia stock jumped 4.5% on Aug. 23 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the time had come for the central bank to begin to cut rates.\n\nAssuming rates come down as fast or even faster than expected, Nvidia is likely to benefit.\n\n3. Infrastructure spending is set to keep ramping up\n\nMuch of Nvidia's demand comes from cloud infrastructure giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, and those companies look set to continue ramping up their purchases of Nvidia's components as they build out their AI capacity.\n\nTop tech CEOs like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk have stressed the importance of staying ahead in the AI race as the consequences of falling behind could be much greater than overspending on AI hardware.\n\nAdditionally, Q4 tends to be a strong quarter in the tech industry, particularly in cloud software and infrastructure, and solid demand there should support further spending on Nvidia's products.\n\nAfter pulling back following its fiscal second-quarter report, Nvidia benefits from lower expectations and a more attractive stock price. If the company executes well on its Blackwell launch, not to mention any boost from the macroeconomic environment, it could be racing back toward its previous highs in the fourth quarter and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Web Services' competitive advantage in AI is its competitors",
        "content": "Amazon Web Services (AMZN) isn't putting all its chips on one AI model. Instead, it aims to win by keeping friends close and potential rivals closer.\n\nWhile other hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) compete on large language models, AWS hopes to offer customers whatever models they want. The cloud giant is positioning itself not just as an artificial intelligence platform to train models but as a marketplace to sell them.\n\n\"There's not going to be one model that's going rule them all,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"The best model today may not be the best model tomorrow. … If you have a platform that has a bunch of models available, it's actually relatively easy to take advantage of new ones or add new capabilities from other providers as they come along.\" An Amazon Web Services logo is pictured during a trade fair in Hannover Messe, in Hanover, Germany, April 22, 2024. (REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned this strategy on Amazon’s latest earnings call. Jassy noted that Amazon's Bedrock service has the \"broadest selection of LLMs\" and offers a variety of leading foundational models to AWS customers, who can then build their own AI applications using Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, Meta’s Llama 3 models, and Amazon's Titan models.\n\nThe latest example of this strategy emerged on Monday when AWS and Oracle announced a partnership despite 15 years of competition between the two cloud providers.\n\nCooperation, not direct competition, is how AWS plans to diversify its revenue streams and monetize AI. AWS is projecting $105 billion in revenue this year — about 17% of Amazon’s total revenue, according to estimates.\n\nAWS not 'rushing in' to chatbots\n\nWhen asked about the perception that Amazon is falling behind on AI — particularly when compared to Microsoft — Garman was quick to mention that for Microsoft, \"it’s not their own technology. … OpenAI was listed as a competitor of theirs, which is an interesting dynamic for them. ... We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\n\nIn other words, AWS’s perceived sluggishness in AI adoption is a strategic feature, not a bug.\n\n\"We felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology that ... looks cool and allows people to write haikus,\" Garman said. \"That's not really the eventual place that the value is going to come from this technology.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat focus on AI infrastructure has helped buoy the stock amid a tech pullback. Year to date, Amazon stock has gained 18%, outperforming the Nasdaq index and other hyperscalers, such as Microsoft and Google.\n\nAnd AWS is not just offering multiple LLMs to customers — the company is also offering chips from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), as well as their own.\n\n“If you talk to customers out there, still, the large majority of usage is on Nvidia chips,\" Garman said. \"They have a great platform … and they're very popular with customers.”\n\nThat popularity explains why AWS has yet to talk about competing directly with Nvidia on chips. While Garman would not share details about the usage ratio of Nvidia's chips to AWS's on internal workloads, he agreed it would be beneficial to rely more fully on their in-house chips over time to protect margins.\n\n“I don't know that we'll ever be fully reliant on [in-house chips] because I think that the Nvidia team builds some great processors and some great products, and they execute really well.”\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, Garman walked a fine line between promoting AWS chips while reminding the audience that AWS offers Nvidia GPUs as well, again promoting the idea of customer choice as AWS's key differentiator.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the Goldman conference on Wednesday morning. Garman quipped that he would have plenty to say about Nvidia's partnership with AWS.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Magnificent 7 Discounts: Buy These 3 Stocks (META, AAPL, NVDA)",
        "content": "Action over the last three months in the stock market has been marked by a notable shift in leaders from Tech and AI to more defensive sectors like Utilities, Healthcare, Real Estate and Bonds. In the chart below we can see that since June, the Real Estate ETF XLRE, Treasury ETF TLT, Utilities ETF XLU and Healthcare XLV have outperformed both SPY and QQQ by a fairly significant margin.\n\nAs the Federal Reserve signals the start of a rate-cutting regime and broad economic indicators (employment, growth, inflation) point to a slowdown (not a recession), it's not surprising that some investors have shifted to more conservative holdings.\n\nHowever, now that tech stocks have been out of favor for nearly three months, many of the leading names, such as the Magnificent Seven stocks have traded to quite attractive levels. In this article, I’ll highlight my top three picks moving forward—Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA)—along with key tactical trading levels to watch. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nApple: New iPhone and AI Innovations\n\nOn Monday, Apple unveiled a new lineup of products, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Key features of the iPhone 16 series include enhanced camera capabilities, improved battery life, a new Action button for quick shortcuts and its new AI system called Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 boasts upgraded health tracking features and a redesigned case. AirPods 4 offer improved audio quality, active noise cancellation, and enhanced hearing health features.\n\nApple has expanded its foray into health monitoring, with the AirPods now administering hearing tests and functioning as a 'clinical-grade' hearing aid. Additionally, the Apple Watch will now be able to monitor for sleep apnea by tracking breathing disturbances.\n\nAlthough critics often note the seemingly incremental improvements to these new Apple products, I find the health-monitoring functionalities especially compelling, while the new AI features could significantly improve usability.\n\nApple stock has notably outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks since May of this year, which is especially impressive considering the high volatility the market has experienced over the last three months. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAlong with the relative strength of Apple stock, a more granular look at the price action shows a potential bull flag forming. If the broad market can hold up and AAPL breaks out above the $220 level, it should make an attempt at new all-time highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the material integration of AI into the iPhone, the most widely used mobile device in the world sets up Apple to possibly ascend to AI leadership. At the least, if the AI narrative picks up again, Apple should be at the forefront. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMeta Platforms: A Well Rounded and Promising Stock Pick\n\nAlthough Meta Platforms seems to semi-regularly get caught up in frenzied controversy such as political scandals and misguided investments (Metaverse) the business continues to grow like crazy and spew profits. These manic cycles, although sometimes exhausting, have created numerous opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares at a discount.\n\nSales are expected to grow 19.8% this year and 13.9% next year, while earnings are projected to jump 43.6% this year and 12.7% next year. Analysts forecast earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years. Additionally, the stock is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.6x, which is inline with the market average and below its 10-year median valuation of 25x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms isn’t currently mixed up in any scandals and has rather been the second-best performing stock in the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023, bested only by Nvidia. But even with this incredible stock price appreciation, META remains among the cheapest of the group when comparing relative valuations thanks to equally impressive growth in EPS. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action in Meta Platforms’ stock also paints a bullish picture. In addition to relative strength, META is building out a bull flag, nest within a broader consolidation. If the stock can break out above the $515 level, it should move into the upper range and beyond. Alternatively, if the stock loses the lower bound support of ~$465, the broader market is likely selling off, and it may be prudent to wait for another opportunity. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nNvidia: Cheapest Relative Valuation in Years\n\nNvidia, the most exciting stock in the market over the last two years, has been struggling over the last three months. Between mid-June and early-August Nvidia staged a nasty correction, falling 35%. After rallying aggressively from the lows and testing the upper bound of the range, the shares have again sold off.\n\nHovering now just above $100, I think investors have an opportunity to buy the stock near the bottom of the range. And not only has the stock come down to more reasonable levels, so has the Semiconductor manufacturer’s valuation. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 38x, which is below its 10-year media of 42.8x and close to the lowest it has been in the last five years. With EPS forecast to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.9, which is a discount based on the metric.\n\nIf we look a little further into the future, Nvidia is trading at just 28x FY26 earnings. If growth remains as high as projected, Nvidia stock should continue to appreciate strongly.\n\nShould Investors Buy Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Apple Stock?\n\nGiven the current market conditions, a shift towards defensive sectors has created attractive buying opportunities among the tech leaders, particularly the Magnificent Seven. Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all experienced pullbacks in recent months, presenting investors with entry points at more reasonable valuations.\n\nApple, with its latest product releases and AI innovations, continues to show resilience and leadership, while Meta Platforms, despite past controversies, is experiencing tremendous growth and remains undervalued compared to its peers. Nvidia, despite its recent correction, offers high growth potential and is trading at its most attractive valuation in years.\n\nFor long-term investors, these stocks offer a blend of stability, innovation, and growth. Apple’s steady outperformance, Meta’s explosive earnings growth, and Nvidia’s dominance in AI and semiconductor technology make these three companies well-positioned for the next market uptrend. With their recent pullbacks, now may be the time to capitalize on their future potential before the market shifts back in favor of tech.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SIRI moves explained: Why Sirius XM’s share price swung wildly after its reverse stock split",
        "content": "You might have woken up this morning to see Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI) down a whopping 7% on early trading. And now, at time of publishing, it’s back up over 4% in midday trading. What’s going on?\n\nMost Read from Fast Company\n\nThis iconic sneaker brand disappeared for 40 years. Now it’s making a comeback Homebuyers are gaining leverage in these housing markets Sizzler is back from the brink with a shiny new brand and ambitions to match\n\nThe stock volatility is the result of two things: a merger between Sirius and Liberty Sirius XM Group (Liberty Media’s Sirius XM tracking stock), and the resulting much-anticipated reverse stock split.\n\nA reverse stock split combines a company’s shares into a smaller number, so they are each worth more. Sirius XM’s 1-for-10 reverse split means that shareholders of the stock received one share for every 10 shares they owned.\n\nWhile a reverse stock split often signals fewer shares and a short-term problem, it does signal good news for the future. But the reason for the volatility could be that while the company’s guidance remains in line with projections, Sirius also forecasted it will generate $200 million less cash in 2024 than it previously promised.\n\nMeanwhile, the merger means Sirius XM now has a “simplified capital structure and strategy for continued success” following a period of mixed financial results and a low stock price. And now, SiriusXM is now Sirius XM Holdings, trading on the Nasdaq under the “SIRI” stock symbol.\n\nThis “new phase” includes a buyback of nearly $1.2 billion in stock and a promise to continue its dividend plan of about 4.3% a year. Both could help Sirius stock rebound over the short and long term.\n\nIf this all sounds familiar, you may remember the jarring amount of stock splits this year at several high-profile companies. With record-breaking profits, markets saw stock splits at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other AI chip makers. Most recently, Nvidia split 10-for-1 back in June. Before that, Nvidia split five times, with 2-for-1 splits in June 2000, September 2001, and April 2006. It also had a 3-for-2 split in September 2007, and a 4-for-1 split in July 2021.\n\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\r\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating and a price target of $600.\n\nLuria noted Meta Platforms as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most critical future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\n\nThe analyst said Meta Platforms has skillfully positioned itself as the open source leader for major technology platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nUnlike previous revolutionary innovations, Luria noted that a mega-cap could only win these two future platforms.\n\nWhile previous technology innovation was driven by nimble startups, AI and Spatial Computing require unprecedented scale, reach, and capital, the analyst said.\n\nWhile Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are crowding into the closed garden side of these platforms, Meta Platforms has the pole position on the open side, Luria noted.\n\nThe analyst expects the closed-garden side of the AI compute platform to be an expensive fight between the Big Techs, but he noted that Meta is almost entirely alone on the open-source side.\n\nGoogle will need to manage the headwind of transitioning to AI-enhanced Search, Meta is already reporting how the advancements in AI are driving better ad delivery and yields, Luria flagged.\n\nIn spatial computing, the analyst expects the tens of billions Meta Platforms have poured into Reality Labs to become the moat that positions Meta Platforms as the open-source winner alongside Apple’s closed garden.\n\nThe analyst said Meta exemplifies the benefits of being led by its founder more than any other mega-cap, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nLuria’s price target represents 24x 2025 EPS, a premium to Alphabet based on better positioning. The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality Lab’s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\n\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for META\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jul 2020 Desjardins Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests",
        "content": "Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests\n\nBofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $210.\n\nThe re-rating followed Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) and Amazon Web Services’ new partnership, which connects Oracle’s Autonomous Database & Exadata Database and AWS applications.\n\nAWS customers would benefit from more seamless access to their data, simplified database administration, billing, and unified customer support, Post noted.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Targets Walmart’s Grocery Market with Expanded Prime Discounts\n\nPost said that Oracle and Amazon were competitive with database customers. Hence, the new partnership suggests that cloud providers have a sizable opportunity to unlock demand for infrastructure and applications using data housed within Oracle’s databases.\n\nAccording to Oracle, partnerships with leading Cloud providers are already driving growth. AWS CEO Matt Garman also spoke at an investor conference, outlining optimism for artificial intelligence demand and AWS’ differentiated infrastructure.\n\nDespite concerns about AI-related disruption to AWS’ strong Cloud industry position, Post said the CEO commentary suggests optimism on AI-related demand and differentiated AWS AI infrastructure to drive client wins.\n\nAlso, Amazon is walking a fine line between promoting its cost-efficient infrastructure and featuring Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong GPU capabilities. Still, he flagged customer choice as a differentiated and compelling offering.\n\nThe price target reflects Post’s Sum Of The Parts (SOTP) analysis, which values the 1P retail business at 1.2 times 2025E Revenue (including subscription and Prime membership fees), the 3P retail business at 3.0 times 2025E Revenue, AWS at 8.0 times 2025 Sales, and the advertising business at 5.0 times 2025 Sales.\n\nFor 2025E, Post’s 8.0 times AWS multiple is relatively below the analyst’s SaaS comps at 8.5 times, his 1.2 times GMV multiple is a discount to his retail comps at 1.3 times, and his 5.0 times advertising multiple is a discount to his digital advertising comps at 5.2 times, which are warranted given growth rates in excess of peers.\n\nOracle Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Oracle, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Oracle, the 200-day moving average sits at $123.04, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $156.09. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up 2.54% at $179.86 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\nLatest Ratings for AMZN\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage On Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Investing.com -- DA Davidson analysts initiated Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 per share price target in a note Tuesday, saying it is facing challenges in its core Search business, and its future growth may depend on other parts of its portfolio.\n\nHowever, the firm sees Alphabet's positioning in these areas as mixed, leading them to expect the stock to continue trading at a discount compared to other mega-cap companies.\n\nThe analysts highlight that Alphabet is at a critical point in its evolution, stating that it \"will either be 'Xeroxed' or emerge as a leader in the most important new categories of Compute.\"\n\nThey draw a parallel between Google's current situation and Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) in the 1980s, which invented much of the technology behind the PC but watched companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) capitalize on it.\n\nDA Davidson expresses concern over Google's slower response to the introduction of AI services, particularly with Microsoft's rapid commercialization of AI over the past 18 months.\n\nWhile they believe Alphabet has shown some encouraging signs, such as the reacceleration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its potential to achieve AI product parity, DA Davidson points out that Google has made notable missteps.\n\nOne example is the under-commercialization of Google TPUs, a viable alternative to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, which have missed capturing much of the $3 trillion hardware market.\n\nShorter-term, Google faces the challenge of transitioning from a 90% market share in Search to something less, as AI-enhanced search tools gain prominence. Coupled with the Department of Justice charges that may limit its monopoly, Google's path forward looks uncertain, according to the firm.\n\nDA Davidson concludes that without more aggressive strategies, Google's stock will likely continue to trade at a discount.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle shares to continue to trade at a discount to other mega-caps - DA Davidson\n\nSweden stocks lower at close of trade; OMX Stockholm 30 down 0.62%\n\nSpain stocks lower at close of trade; IBEX 35 down 0.61%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street is cutting Q3 earnings estimates — why that's 'not a cause for worry'",
        "content": "The fundamental story for stocks is holding steady more than halfway through the third quarter.\n\nAnalysts slashed their earnings expectations for the current quarter by 2.8% during July and August, per FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. But that's not as bad as it may seem.\n\nAs Butters pointed out in a note on Friday afternoon, analysts typically cut their earnings estimates as the quarter goes on.The current level isn't out of the ordinary. Analysts have slashed expectations by 3% on average for the past 20 years.\n\nDataTrek co-founder Nichola Colas wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday morning that these revisions are \"not a cause for worry and could be a positive catalyst as we get into Q3 financial reporting season.\"\n\nColas notes that last quarter, earnings weren't revised down by as much as they usually are and therefore set a more challenging bar for companies to beat. As a result, companies beat earnings expectations by a lower amount than both the five and 10-year averages during the second quarter.\n\nAnd the high bar carried to over to stock reactions, where even companies that beat Wall Street's estimates saw a more muted reaction than normal.\n\nThis was capped off by Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings report on Aug. 28. The AI juggernaut posted earnings and revenue growth of more than 100%, both topping Wall Street's estimates, but the stock faltered the next day as the market read-through appeared to be that good wasn't good enough for investors.\n\nColas noted that the cutting of earnings estimates the current quarter creates a lower bar for companies to surpass and set the stage for a fourth quarter rally in stocks. FILE - Signs at the intersection of Broad and Wall Streets stand near flags flying from the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 4, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAfter earnings grew 11.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, they are expected to increase 4.9% year-over-year in the third quarter, which will kick off in off in earnest with big banks on Oct. 11. Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance the setup for the current quarter and beyond is one of \"earnings resilience.\"\n\nWhile the growth expected in the current quarter isn't considered stellar, Chronert noted that for the first time in six quarters, earnings from the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 not including the Magnificent 7 are growing.

        "content": "Investing.com -- In a note to clients on Tuesday, HSBC said it is bullish on AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), citing significant upside potential in AI-driven revenue that the market has yet to fully appreciate.\n\nAccording to the bank's analysts, AMD's opportunity to close the gap with industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the AI GPU space by fiscal year 2025 (FY25) presents an attractive risk/reward proposition.\n\nThey maintain a Buy rating on the stock, with a target price of $200, reflecting a potential 43% upside.\n\nAMD is \"still a distant second but [has the] potential to narrow the AI gap with Nvidia given Nvidia's roadmap shift and ZT acquisition in FY25,\" said HSBC.\n\nThe bank believes the market is underestimating AMD's potential in the AI space. The firm forecasts AI revenues of $6 billion for AMD in 2024 and $12.3 billion in 2025, well above consensus estimates of $5.1 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively.\n\nHSBC believes that AMD's upcoming MI325X GPU, expected to launch in the second half of 2024, could be more competitive with Nvidia's H200 GPU, which could lead to further revenue upside for AMD.\n\nA key factor in HSBC's optimism is Nvidia's recent adjustments to its AI GPU roadmap. Nvidia has pushed out some of its AI GPU platforms to late 2025, which HSBC says opens the door for AMD to narrow the competitive gap.\n\nAMD's acquisition of ZT Systems is seen as a strategic move that could help the company develop rack-scale infrastructure earlier than expected, providing a further competitive edge.\n\nThe bank maintains that AMD's AI GPU revenue in 2025 could reach $12.3 billion, with a best-case scenario of $15.1 billion.\n\n\"Our scenario analysis based on higher CoWoS of 70k-80k in 2025 implies AI GPU revenue of USD13.2bn-USD15.1bn vs our base case of USD12.3bn, with AI GPU revenue of USD15.1bn in the most bullish scenario being 58% ahead of consensus estimate of USD9.6bn,\" the analysts stated.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHSBC says buy this major chip stock as AI upside potential is not fully realized\n\nGoogle shares to continue to trade at a discount to other mega-caps - DA Davidson\n\nKey events at Nike under CEO John Donahoe\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors are pouring into leveraged ETFs to double up on Nvidia and Tesla—but risk getting burned",
        "content": "When people think of ETFs, the first words that pop into their heads are likely to be “safe” or “boring.” That’s not the case, though, with so-called leveraged ETFs, which are a more recent innovation offering investors a way to double their returns when they make a bet on a stock index—or, as has been the case in the past two years, on individual stocks like Nvidia or Tesla. These products have been soaring in popularity to the point that leveraged bets on individual stocks have recently jumped 400%.\n\nThe chance to double returns through leverage may be appealing, but it’s also one that most ordinary investors may wish to avoid since, if the market moves in the opposite direction than expected, their losses will be double. Since leveraged ETFs now appear to be a permanent part of the investment landscape, it’s worth taking a closer look at how they work and who is using them.\n\nETFs: From safe to speculative\n\nState Street launched the first exchange-traded fund in the U.S. in 1993. Still around to this day, the ticker known as SPY tracks the S&P 500 and offers retail investors a cheap and easy way to approximate the returns of the overall market. Today, ETFs are widely popular as a way to diversify one’s portfolio while pursuing the classic “buy-and-hold” strategies preached by the likes of Warren Buffett and the late Vanguard founder Jack Bogle.\n\nRecently, however, there has been an uptick in popularity for so-called leveraged ETFs, which provide opportunities for more speculative strategies. Leveraged ETFs offer new opportunities for yield, but also introduce new risks for everyday investors as well as potential headaches for regulators.\n\nThe first leveraged ETFs arrived in 2006, 13 years after the launch of the first U.S.-listed ETFs. The product came by way of Maryland ETF giant ProShares, which issued the first leveraged and inverse versions—meaning they offered two times or negative-two times the daily returns of popular market indexes.\n\n“When they first got launched, there was some uncertainty around the adoption,” Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA, told Fortune, “but very quickly it became apparent that there was interest in these products.”\n\nEventually, leveraged ETFs spread to sectors like technology and particularly volatile industries like semiconductors. Then came so-called single-stock funds, which apply the same concept to amplify the bear or bull case on a single security. While some single-stock offerings are listed as ETFs, others are not subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (which applies to mutual funds and ETFs) and fall under the broader umbrella of exchange-traded products.\n\nDespite pushback within the Securities and Exchange Commission, leveraged ETFs offering two times the returns of popular and volatile stocks like Tesla and Nvidia gained approval in the U.S. two years ago. These leveraged single-stock offerings now represent $13.4 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data, compared with $3.3 billion last year.\n\nThese products are also easy to purchase. First mover ProShares still manages the most heavily traded leveraged and inverse index funds, both of which track the Nasdaq. The next biggest funds in each category track the semiconductor industry and are issued by Direxion.\n\nAs these funds become increasingly popular, however, should investors steer clear?\n\nWhat investors need to know about leveraged ETFs and single-stock funds\n\nThe most crucial thing to keep in mind, Ullal said, is that these products are not designed for the average buy-and-hold investor. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs, as well as single-stock funds, use debt and financial derivatives to track an index’s return daily, rather than over an extended period.\n\nFor example, if the S&P 500 increases by 1% on a specific day, a two-times leveraged ETF will return 2% (with the equivalent inverse fund doing the opposite). If the S&P increases by 10% over the course of a month, however, the leveraged ETF will not necessarily return 20%.\n\nThe reason why leveraged ETFs don’t necessarily double over time is because their returns are a function of their debt-to-equity ratios, meaning these funds must rebalance their portfolios at the end of each day and, therefore, do not provide compounding returns. In other words, if the price of the underlying index or stock increases, the leveraged fund must take on debt or buy stock to reset its leverage. The opposite applies if the value of the underlying asset drops.\n\nSo, while the S&P has gained over 20% this year, Direxion’s three-times leveraged ETF for the index has jumped 50%, not 60%, in that span. The same concept applies to single-stock funds. While Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy is up over 260% in the past 12 months, for example, a triple-leveraged product tracking the stock from GraniteShares is down nearly 50% in the same period.\n\n“It’s more designed for taking a directional view or a high-conviction view on a particular theme, factor, [or] sector,” Ullal said of a leveraged product, “as opposed to holding it for the long term.”\n\nFor both institutional or sophisticated retail investors, he noted, these funds are a quick, easy, and highly liquid way to make bets surrounding earnings calls, jobs reports, or other important events. The products are especially useful for retail traders who don’t want to open a new brokerage account approved for trading options and futures directly.\n\nThese funds, Ullal said, present a tradeoff to regulators like the SEC, which has tried to thread the needle between promoting product availability and mitigating the risk of misuse. When the first single-stock funds in the U.S. debuted in 2022, some SEC commissioners warned the SEC had not done enough to protect investors.\n\n“We haven’t had huge issues,” Ullal said, “but there’s always inherent risk.”\n\nInvestors appear to be largely using the products as intended. Leveraged and inverse funds tracking the Nasdaq or semiconductor sector account for the top four ETFs by trading volume, with single-day funds for Nvidia and Tesla, as well as a three-times leveraged S&P ETF, also in the top 10.\n\n“The ratio of the trading volume to assets is very high,” Ullal said, “so that’s always an indicator there’s more institutional adoption.”\n\nWhile the exact breakdown of hedge funds to retail investors is not known, Ullal said, the data shows investors gravitate to the most leveraged forms of these products.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing, but investors need to know what they’re getting into.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia is a bargain now that AI is going beyond the hyperscalers, says Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "The brutal sell-off in AI chip stock Nvidia offers investors an attractive entry point, Goldman Sachs argued on Monday.\n\nFounder and CEO Jensen Huang has seen his company lose 17% of its market cap since issuing muted third-quarter guidance that sparked concerns its rapid earnings growth may not be sustainable. Only a handful of companies are currently fueling its booming AI chip business, with just four customers comprising nearly half of all Nvidia's revenue.\n\nSpeaking with Yahoo Finance on the sidelines of a tech conference hosted by his bank, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari remained confident sales will pick up as customers outside of the three cloud hyperscalers—Amazon, Microsoft and Google—start to invest in their own AI compute clusters.\n\n“Demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,” he said on Monday, reaffirming his ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock and arguing the stock was oversold. “You are seeing a broadening in the demand portfolio into enterprise, even into sovereign states.”\n\nBased on Hari’s estimates for Nvidia’s 2025 profits, Nvidia's price-to-earnings multiple is in the low 20s thanks to the sharp pull-back over the past couple of weeks. By comparison, Tesla trades at 77 times next year's consensus earnings estimates, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nCustom silicon the latest trend among chip-starved Nvidia customers\n\nNvidia has driven this year’s gains in the S&P 500 index, but lately it has become a victim of its own success.\n\nA combination of production bottlenecks and a lack of meaningful competition means customers are waiting to be allocated supply of Nvidia’s Hopper AI training chips. Those that are able to actually get their hands on this prized resource are paying through the nose, causing profit margins at Nvidia to balloon.\n\nUnhappy with the lack of choice, tech companies—including Amazon and Tesla—are developing their own custom silicon rather than depending entirely on Nvidia. These proprietary chips can be fabricated at specialized foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), bypassing Nvidia entirely.\n\nHari acknowledged barriers are dropping when it came to the make-or-buy question, but argued the threat is overblown.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0BQoiRjf0\n\nFor one, Nvidia H100s command a 90% share of the AI chip market versus rivals like AMD’s MI300 series, so no one comes close to its technology. Those customers that are in the process of developing custom silicon are primarily interested in solving compute tasks unique to their businesses, Hari explained.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile these would represent lost sales that would have otherwise gone to Nvidia, the proprietary chips would not be suited for competing with Nvidia directly on the open market.\n\nHari cited Google as an example, saying the company is working on its own AI chips to help improve Google Search. By comparison, the group’s hyperscaler, Google Cloud Platform, showed no signs of a diminished appetite for Huang’s chips.\n\n“They’re still buying a boatload of Nvidia GPUs, and you can make the same case for Amazon,” the Goldman Sachs analyst said. “Within merchant silicon, Nvidia is the go-to. And even versus custom silicon, they’ve got the edge in terms of pace of innovation.”\n\nGoldman bearish on Intel, urging chipmaker to finally hit its guidance\n\nAt the same time, Hari remained bearish on Intel, arguing CEO Pat Gelsinger has an uphill battle.\n\nNot only is Intel is losing the race with Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm on the product side, but its foundry business has no clear path to surpassing TSMC in terms of production technology.\n\nCompanies looking to outsource fabrication of their chips would not risk swapping out the Taiwanese giant for the inferior technology of Intel, argued Hari.\n\nHe rates Intel a \"sell\"’\", but offered some advice to Gelsinger on how to at least put a floor under the stock in the near term:\n\n“For starters it would help for the company to start hitting what they guide to,” he said “They’ve disappointed the market quite frequently and that’s never good for a stock price.”\n\nNeither Nvidia nor Intel could immediately be reached by Fortune for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia’s Blackwell chip delay is center stage amid stock slump",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nervous Nvidia Corp. investors are eager for an update on its Blackwell chip rollout — hoping for a catalyst to halt the stock’s recent decline.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nThe next-generation processor was unveiled six months ago, but has faced engineering snags that delayed its release. While Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang tried to reassure the market last month that revenue from the chip is coming soon, some investors were left wanting for details. That — along with broader macroeconomic jitters — has contributed to a 15% selloff since the earnings report.\n\nLingering questions about Blackwell will be a key focus when Huang speaks at a Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. He’s scheduled to speak with David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive officer, at 7:20 a.m. local time.\n\n“Nobody likes a delay,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc. “It’s one of those blips that investors are just kind of latching onto.” In the absence of other positive catalysts for the stock — and combined with broader worries hitting the whole tech sector — the Blackwell snags have added to concerns that the artificial intelligence darling has risen too far, too fast.\n\nWhile Nvidia has done a good job of managing expectations, “they probably could communicate better, particularly around the Blackwell issue,” Mulberry added.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Bank of America analysts, who wrote in a research report last week that details about the readiness of Blackwell shipments are the key fundamental catalyst for a recovery in Nvidia shares.\n\nBlackwell is the next generation of the company’s dominant AI processor and has been eagerly awaited by investors to provide the next leg of growth. Nvidia acknowledged in its latest earnings report that there were issues with production and said it has had to revamp part of the chip’s manufacturing process.\n\nStill, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue from Blackwell in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends January 31. The production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026, according to comments on the earnings call.\n\nIf everything goes smoothly and Nvidia is able to deliver its Blackwell chips on this schedule, then the stock may become less volatile than in recent months, Mulberry said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey’ve said they’ll be able to bring things up to speed by early 2025, and “if they can communicate clearly that they are still on track to do that and there won’t be any further delays in production, they can quell some of these short-term fears,” he said.\n\nStill, if Blackwell faces more delays or snags, that could add to downside pressure on the shares — especially with few other catalysts on the horizon and potential risks related to a US Justice Department antitrust probe.\n\nRandy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington National Bank, agrees that near-term pressure on Nvidia shares is likely to the downside. Still, for investors who believe in the potential of AI in the long-term, it could be a good time to add to positions.\n\n“We’re maybe part-way through the mid-cycle correction,” said Hare. “And then I think you’ll get a good opportunity where people will realize that this is the best growth area in the market and they’ll start putting money to work again.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc. lost its court fight over a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) Irish tax bill, in a boost to the European Union’s crackdown on special deals doled out by nations to big companies. Google lost its bid to topple a once-record €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) European Union fine for abusing its monopoly power to crush rival shopping services. Apple introduced the latest version of its flagship device, the iPhone 16, betting it can entice consumers with modest hardware upgrades and AI technology that’s still on the horizon.

        "content": "Investing Your First $10,000 In ETFs, Redditors Share Their Tips For Beginning Investors\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFor young investors, getting started can be exciting but also nerve-wracking. One 25-year-old investor posted in the r/dividends subreddit to get advice on investing $10,000. The investor was looking for ideas for low to medium-risk high-yield exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and plans to add $250 to $500 monthly.\n\nRedditors chimed in with various ETFs and guidance for the beginning investor, including ensuring they have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before starting. Many cautioned the young investor not to dive in with all $10,000 into one option but to slowly begin building up positions. Dollar-cost averaging is a way to build up positions over time, thereby reducing the risk of buying all at once at an unfavorable price.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nSome suggested using limit orders to help narrow down buying prices. High-yield ETFs do not always have high returns, and some cautioned the young investor to consider both. Others said that one potential strategy is to max out a Roth IRA before investing through a taxable account.\n\nSPLG: A Low-Cost Index Option\n\nThe SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPLG) seeks to match the total return performance of the S&P 500 Index. Redditors praised the fund’s lower expense ratio. SPLG is a low-cost ETF that seeks to offer comprehensive exposure to the large-cap part of the market. It has met the benchmark of the index it tracks for ten years. Major holdings include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nDGRO: Tracking Consistently Growing Dividends\n\nStarted in 2014, the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSE:DGRO) is designed to offer exposure to companies that provide consistent dividend growth with a low expense ratio. It tracks the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, and since its inception, it has delivered an 11.27% total return, roughly in line with its benchmark. Top holdings are blue-chip companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Apple Inc.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast — No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade. The total net worth of these five entrepreneurs is $223 billion – they all believe in one company where you can lend money to companies at 7-9% APY.\n\n$100K In VOO?\n\nOne Redditor shared the experience of achieving the enviable goal of $100,000 by first investing in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO). This fund invests in stocks in the S&P 500 Index and tracks the index's return. This fund offers the potential for high investment growth but may have downturns along with the market it tracks. It is often suitable for long-term investors seeking growth rather than dividends. “After that first 100K, I started thinking about building an income portfolio and did a lot of research from there. I still have that 100K in VOO, never sold, and it’s worth a lot more than 100K now. I’m just focusing on dividend funds at this time,\" said the Redditor.\n\nSPYI: An Active Approach\n\nThe NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is an actively managed fund created in 2022. It distributes high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy. Because the fund is actively managed, it has a higher expense ratio and seeks to exploit tax loss harvesting opportunities. It has generated 25.9% in total returns since inception.\n\nThe young investor has the most essential asset available for anyone hoping to make big returns in the stock market: time. As Warren Buffett famously said, \"The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.\"\n\nA 9% Return In Just 3 Months\n\nEquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets. This short-term note investment offers investors a 9% rate of return (APY) with just a 3 month term and $5K minimum. The Basecamp rate is at a significant spread to t-bills. This healthy rate of return won't last long. With the Fed poised to cut interest rates in the near future, now could be the time to lock in a favorable rate of return with a flexible, relatively liquid investment option.\n\nWhat's more, Alpine Note — Basecamp can be rolled into another Alpine Note for compounding returns, or into another of EquityMultiple's rigorously vetted real estate investments, which also carry a minimum investment of just $5K. Basecamp is exclusively open to new investors on the EquityMultiple platform.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Some market prognosticators would argue that, as Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock goes, so goes the artificial intelligence (AI) bull market. Wall Street rallied around Nvidia, thanks to its dominance in the AI chip market. It's the flagship company representing the emergence of large language models and other AI technology, which is arguably the largest technological leap forward since the internet started developing in the late 1990s.\n\nAfter soaring for most of the past two years, Nvidia's stock price has reversed course. The stock is down about 22% from its June 2024 high. Buying the dip on winning stocks has been a successful investing strategy for years. And to be honest, it's hard to imagine an AI future without Nvidia playing a significant role.\n\nHowever, you may want to consider these risks before buying the stock today.\n\nNvidia looks cheap, but perhaps it's for a reason\n\nNvidia's AI-friendly GPU chips have become the go-to choice for technology companies building large data centers to run powerful AI models. Approximately $26.3 billion of Nvidia's overall $30 billion in Q2 revenue was from its data center segment, so Nvidia has effectively become a pure play on AI chips. The good news is that data center revenue grew 154% year over year in Q2 and 16% from the prior quarter, a sign that chip demand remains strong.\n\nAnalysts now estimate Nvidia will earn $2.84 per share this year and $4 per share next year. Using next year's estimates, that prices Nvidia at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26. If Nvidia grows earnings by 40% annually over the long term, as analysts believe it will, it's arguably a bargain now.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that Nvidia's revenue, as impressive as it could wind up being, is risky enough that investors may want a tremendous margin of safety to buy the stock. A small handful of companies are propping up Nvidia's sales. Specifically, four companies make up 40% of Nvidia's total revenue. To make matters worse, all four of them -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon -- have worked on developing their own custom AI chips.\n\nMargins could become a problem\n\nThese companies will not necessarily discontinue using Nvidia's chips entirely (though anything is possible). But Nvidia has enjoyed remarkable pricing power since the AI rush began early last year. AI became a race where speed to market became the priority.\n\nThere are signs that the AI market is slowly evolving. Investors have openly questioned whether big technology companies see the returns needed to justify all this data center spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket research has indicated that traffic to ChatGPT, once the fastest-growing app in history, has dropped in recent months. Amazon's management noted in the company's Q2 earnings call that its AI customers want better value.\n\nPrice didn't matter when AI was new, but it's starting to become a conversation. That could spell pricing pressure for Nvidia moving forward. The company may have to choose between sacrificing market share to competition or accepting lower margins to retain share.\n\nThis year, Nvidia is guiding to gross margins in the mid-70s, so this is something to watch in 2025 and beyond. You can see that margins this high are well beyond anything before the pandemic: NVDA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nIt's tempting to ignore such a long-term concern, but remember that Nvidia only looks cheap because everyone expects stellar sales and profits years into the future. Margins reverting to long-term averages would be disastrous for investors.\n\nShould investors buy Nvidia stock today?\n\nThese concerns aren't to dissuade you from owning Nvidia. They are raised to keep you aware of the risks. As impressive as Nvidia's financials are today, they've been propped up by a few deep-pocketed customers throwing money at being the early AI winner. Nvidia could be the leading AI chip company 20 years from now, but sales and/or profit margins could also fizzle out and collapse the stock.\n\nThe tricky part is that both things could be true.\n\nLong-term investors who would like to buy the stock on this dip should do so responsibly. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to accumulate shares slowly. That way, volatility is more of an opportunity than a reason to stress. Nvidia could be a bumpy ride for the foreseeable future, even if it makes investors money in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nFor the better part of 18 months, the stock market rally has been defined by the rise of artificial intelligence and its impact on a few large tech stocks.\n\nBut an increasing number of Wall Street strategists don't believe that thesis is what will drive the S&P 500's (^GSPC) next leg higher.\n\n\"Our sense is that NVDA is becoming just another Large Cap Growth stock,\" Citi's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nNvidia's (NVDA) recent earnings release did little to impress investors. The stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release. But that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release.\n\nAnd, as Chronert's team highlights, after a more than 2,000% gain in the past five years, including gaining more than 110% this year alone, Nvidia stock appears to be coming back down to earth.\n\nWith that cooling off, the current moment may come to mark the end of the first AI-based chapter in this bull market.\n\n\"A simple look at the deceleration in rate of forward guidance increases suggests that [Nvidia's] most profound performance and fundamental impacts on index price action may be behind,\" Chronert's team wrote.\n\nAs top holding in the index, what Nvidia does on any given day will remain in focus as it can hold back or bolster the broader market's returns. But recent market action has shown a clear shift in what's driving investors to buy stocks. Instead of wondering how many generative AI chips one company is selling to a few others, developments in the macroeconomy are back to being top of mind for investors, especially the severity of the labor market's cooling.\n\nTake what's driving the market. Since the start of the quarter on July 1, the S&P 500 is nearly flat. Nvidia, down nearly 15%, and the Magnificent Seven as a whole, off more than 5%, have both lagged the benchmark index.\n\nMeanwhile, non-tech areas like Utilities, up about 12%, and Financials, up nearly 10%, have been leading the market rally, benefitting from investors positioning for interest rate cuts.\n\nFor now, it's a macro-driven market and every economic data release seems to matter more than an Nvidia earnings release or a headline about AI chip shipment delays.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the best illustration came last week. The worst weekly performance for both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for all of 2024 came when the August jobs report failed to provide clarity on the health of the labor market and what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates on Sept. 18.\n\nOn the one hand, of course Nvidia's health and trajectory are still critical to the current bull market. On the other, big as Nvidia is, it's not more important than the US economy. And, perhaps, that's the way it should be. It is after all \"just another Large Cap Growth stock.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Has Plunged 22%. Here's Why 1 Top Wall Street Analyst Thinks It's Time to Load Up on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock.",
        "content": "For years, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a superstar prospect in the investing world. However, the stock isn't as highly sought after at the moment as it was earlier in 2024. Nvidia's share prices are down over 22% from the peak it set in June. The stock was down even more a month ago before mounting a temporary comeback that quickly faded.\n\nIs it time to sell Nvidia? Some might believe so. But one top Wall Street analyst thinks it's instead time to load up on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock.\n\nBehind Nvidia's decline\n\nThere are multiple factors behind Nvidia's recent decline. The delay in shipping GPUs based on the company's new Blackwell architecture is a top one. Investors had hoped the revenue from these powerful new chips would begin hitting Nvidia's top line sooner rather than later.\n\nNvidia's second-quarter earnings results also arrived with a thud. The company beat Wall Street's revenue and earnings estimates. However, sometimes the official estimates aren't really what analysts want. Nvidia failed to achieve the so-called \"whisper numbers\" in Q2.\n\nSome investors have also been concerned that the AI boom has run its course. They worry that Nvidia's customers could reduce spending on the GPUs they need to power AI models.\n\nFinally, Bloomberg News reported last week that the U.S. Department of Justice issued a subpoena to Nvidia as part of an investigation into potential violations by the company of federal antitrust laws. Nvidia denied receiving a subpoena, but the story caused its shares to sink further.\n\nA \"compelling\" valuation\n\nThese issues could cause some investors to choose to stay on the sidelines. However, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya thinks now is a great time to buy Nvidia stock. Arya acknowledged in a note to investors last week that \"market forces could enhance near-term stock volatility.\" But he added that Nvidia's valuation is \"compelling\" with shares trading at roughly 27 times consensus earnings for fiscal year 2026 -- the cheapest valuation for Nvidia over the last five years.\n\nBank of America's 12-month price target for the stock is $165. That reflects an upside potential in the ballpark of 55%.\n\nWhat about the Blackwell delay? BofA expects Nvidia to confirm that shipments are underway over the next several weeks. This view seems to align with comments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the company's Q2 earnings conference call. Huang said that shipments will begin in Q4. Even without Blackwell, Arya projects that the demand for Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper chips will remain strong.\n\nStory continues\n\nBofA doesn't believe the AI boom is anywhere close to being over. Arya wrote, \"The tech industry will give itself at least another 1-2 years of intense buildout\" of Nvidia's Blackwell chips. He added, \"Efforts thus far with the first wave of large language models (LLM), using NVDA Hopper was just the teaser.\"\n\nAs for the reported Department of Justice probe, Bank of America doesn't expect any impact on Nvidia at this point. The Wall Street firm stated that federal investigations aren't unusual with big U.S. technology companies.\n\nIs this Wall Street analyst right about Nvidia?\n\nI can't find much to quibble about with anything Bank of America said about Nvidia. The stock's valuation is arguably the most compelling it's been in quite a while. I suspect Nvidia will confirm Blackwell shipments in the near future. The demand for the company's Hopper GPUs will almost certainly remain robust until Blackwell GPUs are available in high quantities.\n\nBofA is almost certainly correct that the AI boom will continue for at least another year or two. Comments made by executives at cloud services giants Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet in their recent quarterly calls support this view.\n\nI also agree that it's way too early to assume that any DOJ investigation will impact Nvidia. Such probes can lead nowhere.\n\nMy only qualm with Bank of America's take on Nvidia is that I'm not sure if the stock will soar 55% over the next 12 months. However, I wouldn't bet against it happening. Even if Nvidia doesn't hit BofA's price target, the beaten-down AI stock looks like a good pick to load up on during the current pullback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Seemingly Infatuated With These 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Between a steady stream of economic data releases and thousands of companies lifting the hood on their operating results every three months, it can be easy for investors to miss an important announcement. Last month, one of the most-critical announcements of the quarter likely went under the radar for some investors.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F gives investors a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's brightest investment minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEven though this information can be up to 45 days old when filed, 13Fs still offer valuable clues about which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of top money managers -- including billionaire investors.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the June-ended quarter is that, while artificial intelligence (AI) is still a popular trend, billionaires weren't shy about parting ways with shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But while Nvidia was shown to the door, 13Fs make clear that billionaire investors were seemingly infatuated with two other hypergrowth stocks.\n\nSeven billionaire money managers were sellers of Nvidia stock\n\nThe June-ended quarter marked the third consecutive quarter that at least seven prominent billionaire asset managers were sellers of Nvidia stock. The latest round of sellers included (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nConsidering that Nvidia's shares have gained 603% since 2023 began, through the closing bell on Sept. 6, profit-taking is a valid reason that likely explains some of this selling activity. But there's more to this story than just billionaires cashing in their chips for tax or diversification purposes.\n\nTo start with, investor expectations for the AI revolution are probably too lofty. For 30 years, every highly touted innovation and technology has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. This has been a reflection of investors consistently overestimating the uptake of new technologies/innovations by consumers and businesses. Since most companies lack a clearly defined plan for how they'll monetize AI, it's looking likely that artificial intelligence is simply the next in a long line of hyped bubbles.\n\nStory continues\n\nRapidly growing external and internal competition represents another reason for billionaire investors to fade Nvidia.\n\nDespite Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) having clear computing advantages over external competitors, the company's extensive chip backlog, coupled with the considerably cheaper price point for non-Nvidia AI-GPUs, is liable to coerce at least some businesses to turn to its competitors.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are internally developing AI-GPUs that'll be used in their data centers. The writing is on the wall that Nvidia's chips are going to miss out on valuable data center real estate moving forward.\n\nBut while billionaire money managers were busy dumping shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, they were actively piling into the following two supercharged growth stocks. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first high-octane growth stock that billionaire investors were drawn to in the June-ended quarter is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Form 13F filings show that five top-tier billionaire investors were buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,391,262 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,597,676 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,214,055 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,114,948 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (702,235 shares)\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace, this operating segment isn't why these five billionaires purchased shares of Amazon during the second quarter.\n\nThe primary lure for Amazon as an investment is its globally leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Tech analysis firm Canalys pegged Amazon Web Services (AWS) worldwide market share at 33%, as of June 2024. AWS has a sustained double-digit growth rate, is pacing more than $105 billion in annual run-rate sales, and is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAWS is also Amazon's vessel to take advantage of the rise of AI. The company plans to deploy generative AI solutions to help AWS clients improve their business and better reach consumers. The enterprise cloud and AI revolution are still in their early innings, which bodes exceptionally well for AWS' future.\n\nBut there's more to Amazon than just AWS and its e-commerce platform. Amazon is drawing more than 3 billion visits each month, which makes it a magnet for businesses wanting to advertise. Advertising services revenue has grown by at least 20% on a year-over-year basis for two years.\n\nFurthermore, its growing content library and exclusive sports partnerships -- an 11-year streaming rights deal with the NBA and the streaming rights for Thursday Night Football -- should afford the company exceptional pricing power with its Prime subscription.\n\nNio\n\nThe second hypergrowth stock that billionaires appear to be infatuated with in lieu of Nvidia is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio(NYSE: NIO). In spite of its diminutive nominal share price, which hovered around $5 for much of the second quarter, a half-dozen billionaires piled in, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (4,018,659 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,484,185 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (626,300 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (395,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (30,868 shares)\n\nOn one hand, we've certainly witnessed a cooling in EV demand throughout 2024. Competition has picked up in the EV arena, and consumers have been a bit leery to take the plunge given the lack of available EV charging infrastructure. But in spite of these challenges, we've witnessed meaningful sales growth and a sizable production ramp from Nio.\n\nSince China lifted its cumbersome COVID-19 mitigation measures in December 2022, Nio has enjoyed a fairly steady production expansion. The absence of supply chain constraints has allowed the company to produce around 20,000 EVs per month. Through August, deliveries were up nearly 36% from the comparable period in 2023.\n\nNio also wins with its innovation. It's been introducing at least one new EV annually for years, and has taken advantage of an increase in demand since rolling out its NT 2.0 platform, which incorporates an assortment of new driver assistance features.\n\nTo add, Nio introduced its ONVO brand to the world in May. Whereas Nio has traditionally focused on premium EVs, the ONVO brand is more family oriented and will provide a potentially more palatable price point for Chinese consumers.\n\nLastly, the efforts of management to keep costs under control while improving margins are beginning to pay off. Vehicle margin jumped six percentage points in the June-ended quarter to 12.2% from the prior-year period, while adjusted net loss shrank close to 17%. Though Nio still has a lot of work to do to reach profitability, it's taking steps in the right direction.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Taiwan Semiconductor, Micron Technology, NetApp, NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 10, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, Micron Technology Inc. MU, NetApp Inc. NTAP, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nGolden Opportunity to Buy AI-Focused Stocks on the Recent Dip\n\nSeptember syndrome is already visible in U.S. stock markets. Historically, September is the worst-performing month for Wall Street. This year, too, the situation remains challenging. In the first four trading days of this month, the three major indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — tumbled 2.9%, 4.2% and 5.8%, respectively.\n\nThe extremely overvalued artificial intelligence (AI) stocks suffered the maximum brunt of a recent stock market meltdown. Despite the recent mayhem, the AI frenzy remains intact. So far, no negative news appears for the generative AI ecosystem. Therefore, this meltdown provides a lucrative opportunity to enter AI-centric stocks on the dip for near-term gains.\n\nThree such stocks are: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Micron Technology Inc. and NetApp Inc. All three stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIs Recession Nearby or a Knee-Jerk Expression?\n\nTheoretically a recession means contraction of GDP (negative GDP growth rate) for two consecutive quarters. The U.S. GDP grew at 1.4% in first-quarter 2024. The second reading of second-quarter GDP was 3%. On Sept 4, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow projected a 2.1% GDP growth rate for the third quarter.\n\nSome soft key economic data over a period of time never indicate a nearby recession. In fact, the Fed was eagerly waiting for these weak economic data, especially labor market data, along with a gradually declining inflation rate, in order to initiate a rate-cut regime.\n\nFinally, the recent AI turmoil is nothing but profit-taking, especially on the part of institutional investors. Stock markets consist of bull and bear operators. As bulls fly high, bears wait quietly for a suitable time and some reasons to be good enough for profit-booking so that they can reenter the market at a reasonably low level.\n\nSo far, this year, buy-on-the-dip remains the best investment strategy. Every dip in stocks, especially in AI-giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This time too, the same outcome will appear.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree AI-Focused Stocks With Significant Price Upside\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has become a new poster boy on the global artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy. TSM is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world’s best AI chipset developers. The company is experiencing solid demand for its advanced technologies, such as 3-nanometer (nm) and 5nm. TSM’s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus.\n\nTSM is the largest manufacturer of NVIDIA Corp.’s chipsets. NVIDIA is globally the largest developers of generative AI-based chips. TSM also caters to Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and others.\n\nSolid Earnings Estimate Revisions for TSM Stock\n\nTSM has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 23.6% and 24.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 30 days.\n\nHuge Price Upside Potential for TSM Shares\n\nThe stock price of Taiwan Semiconductor has jumped 50.8% year to date. In the past month shares have fallen 4.7%. Despite this, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 25.1% from the last closing price of $156.82. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$250.\n\nMicron Technology Inc.\n\nMicron Technology has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA’s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supplies. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nStrong Earnings Estimate Revisions for MU Stock\n\nMU has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 57% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 60 days.\n\nTremendous Price Upside Potential for MU Shares\n\nThe stock price of Micron Technology has advanced a meager 1.3% year to date. In the past month shares have fallen 6.2%. Despite this, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents a jump of 80% from the last closing price of $86.38. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100-$225.\n\nNetApp Inc.\n\nNetApp’s performance is being driven by demand across the all-flash and cloud storage portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2024, all-Flash Array Business’ annualized revenue run rate was $3.6 billion, up 17% year over year.\n\nNetApp expects its expertise in tackling critical customer priorities, such as AI, business analytics, cloud transitions, data security and application modernization, to drive expansion. The enterprise storage products of NTAP will allow users to boost their workload including traditional enterprise applications and generative AI.\n\nRobust Earnings Estimate Revisions for NTAP Stock\n\nNTAP has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.9% and 8.8%, respectively, for the current year (ending April 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter, next-quarter, current-year and next-year earnings has improved over the last 30 days.\n\nAttractive Price Upside Potential for NTAP Shares\n\nThe stock price of NetApp has climbed 29.6% year to date. In the past month shares have fallen 4.2%. Despite this, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 13.3% from the last closing price of $114.18. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $108-$155.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got a Grim Warning From Apple and Amazon",
        "content": "Semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\n\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\n\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\nApple's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\n\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\n\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\n\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 33% last month, in a positive signal to investors betting on a smartphone market recovery and sustained demand for Nvidia Corp.’s AI chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation\n\nSales reached NT$250.9 billion ($7.8 billion) in August, slowing from the previous month’s 45% growth pace. For the third quarter, analysts expect TSMC’s revenue to grow 37%, extending a recovery from the post-Covid depths of 2023.\n\nWhile just a month’s snapshot, the results could assuage concerns about whether the market has over-estimated the durability of AI infrastructure spending. Nvidia’s shares shed some $279 billion on Sept. 3 in their biggest single-day loss of value, after reporting earnings that failed to live up to the loftiest expectations.\n\nTaiwan’s largest company now makes more than half of its revenue from high-performance computing, the segment of its business driven by AI demand.\n\nNvidia’s go-to chipmaker is also the main manufacturer for the iPhone’s main processor. Apple Inc. on Monday unveiled the iPhone 16, built for AI “from the ground up” but with capabilities that will be gradually added to the device via software updates. Wall Street is betting on a bounce-back in demand for mobile devices.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nApple’s adoption of Wi-Fi 7 on the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro should accelerate technology penetration and boost demand for TSMC’s N6 (7-nanometer) and N4 (5-nanometer) nodes already used by Broadcom and MediaTek and others for Wi-Fi 7 chip production. A18 and A18 Pro processor performance gains align with our expectations, reinforcing a positive outlook for TSMC’s N3E node sales growth.\n\n- Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nTSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings. In July, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.\n\nAs the market improves, Chief Executive Officer C.C.

        "title": "Could Nvidia Stock Double in the Next Year?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on an unprecedented run for a company its size. In 2023, the stock rose nearly 240%. While 2024 hasn't been nearly as good, it has still been impressive, with Nvidia's stock rising around 108% so far.\n\nInvestors have gotten a bit spoiled by Nvidia's performance over the past two years, and the status quo may lead some to think Nvidia could double again in the next year. Is this possible?\n\nAI is driving the demand for Nvidia's GPUs\n\nNvidia's rise has been directly tied to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) computing. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are instrumental in training AI models, as they can process multiple calculations in parallel. Nvidia's products are pretty much undisputed as the best choice in the space, so it naturally became the top pick for any company looking to build out its AI computing infrastructure. The key here is that these companies don't buy one or two GPUs; they connect thousands of these devices to create a machine that can quickly process incredible amounts of information.\n\nAs a result of this demand, Nvidia's sales have gone through the roof. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ending July 28), its revenue rose 122% year over year to $30 billion. Its data center business had the best quarter, with revenue rising 154% year over year to $26.3 billion. One thing to note here is that it also rose 16% quarter over quarter, which shows demand is still ramping up.\n\nThe performance isn't going away, either. In Q3, management expects $32.5 billion in revenue.\n\nClearly, Nvidia's business is crushing it, and demand is still increasing. But is this enough to cause the stock to double?\n\nNvidia has a lot of success already priced into the stock\n\nFor Nvidia's stock to double, the company would need to be worth $5.2 trillion. For context, the world's largest company is Apple, which is worth under $3.4 trillion.\n\nThat's a tall task in just a year, and it's unlikely that it could be accomplished in this time.\n\nWhy? Because all of Nvidia's growth is already baked into the stock. If you take a look at Nvidia's valuation metrics, you can calculate that Wall Street has already baked in around 33% earnings growth from now until the end of its fiscal year. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhile Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS) rose 168% in Q2, this figure is about to face tough comparisons now that it's overlapping some of fiscal 2024's strong quarters. Furthermore, a price tag of 50 times trailing earnings and 37 times forward earnings is quite expensive.\n\nIt's more common for a company with a strong pedigree, like Nvidia, to trade for around 30 times forward earnings. So, not only does Nvidia's stock have a bit to go before returning to that point, it would also need to double its earnings for the stock to double.\n\nWhen could that be?\n\nAt Nvidia's current stock price, it would need its forward EPS projections to be $7.08 to be worth 15 times forward earnings. Because we set the base valuation at 30 times forward earnings, this would result in the stock price doubling.\n\nFinding far-out earnings projections isn't easy, and only one Wall Street analyst provides fiscal 2028 (ending January 2028) EPS projections. This analyst sees EPS of $5.45, which is still a ways away from the required $7.08.\n\nIf it continues that growth trajectory, Nvidia will reach the mark around fiscal 2029, which is about four and a half years away. While that's not a double in a year, that performance would still beat the broader market, which tends to double about every seven years.\n\nNvidia isn't doubling anytime soon, but that doesn't mean it can't be a solid investment now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's the 'magical' moment Goldman Sachs sees for tech stocks",
        "content": "To get big tech stocks powering higher again, it will take the convergence of two factors, says Goldman Sachs' veteran tech analyst Kash Rangan.\n\nThe magic formula is a steady dose of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve combined with a burst of innovation that jumpstarts earnings growth in excess of 20%.\n\n\"We have to get the industry back from an 11% growth rate to 20%-30% and to do that, new innovation has to happen,\" Rangan told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Monday.\n\nRangan — a bull on Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) — says the tech sector must deliver on the AI front in areas like upselling customers and monetization.\n\n\"When you compound that innovation with lower rates, magic happens,\" Rangan said.\n\nInvestor attention is squarely on the Fed as it nears its next monetary policy decision on Sept. 18.\n\nThe Fed has widely telegraphed its first rate cut in several years as it looks to stabilize an economy that's beginning to slow.\n\n\"I wouldn't rule out 50 basis points, but 25 basis points strikes me as more likely,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\n\"I think there is a solid rationale for doing [a 50 basis point cut]. And the rationale is that five and three-eighths, five and a quarter to 5.5% is a really high fed funds rate. It's the highest policy rate in the G10. It is despite the fact that the US has actually seen more progress on inflation than most G10 economies,\" Hatzius added.\n\nAs for the other component, that may take a little more time — although signs of fresh innovation inside the AI growth story is beginning to surface.\n\nSalesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me in late August the company is on the cusp of releasing AI powered digital agents that can help businesses automate customer service. Salesforce will charge the usage by conversation, Benioff says.\n\nMeantime, AMD (AMD) chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su took the veil off a series of new AI chips through 2026 in an interview at the conference today.\n\n\"AI is a much larger cycle than I would have expected five years ago,\" Su said.\n\nTo be sure, tech stocks could use a little magic right now.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has shed about 5% in September as investors take profits in hot AI trades amid fears of slowing economic growth. Investors have also been concerned about an AI spending slowdown, triggered in part by mixed second quarter earnings from chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia is off by a whopping 11% month to date, with AMD down 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The recent performance [of Nvidia's stock] hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance at the conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons (AMZN), the Googles (GOOGL), the Microsofts (MSFT) of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

He thinks the company will need some time to get its technology —notably AI chips — on par with its better-performing rivals, if they can do it at all.\n\nGoldman's bearish take on Intel — while having Nvidia on its closely watched conviction buy list — comes at a precarious time for the company.\n\nIntel widely missed second quarter analyst estimates on sales, gross profit margin, and earnings as it encountered more challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to ramp AI chip production.\n\nThe company took the drastic action of suspending its dividend, which will go into effect in the fourth quarter. Intel has paid a dividend for 125 straight quarters previously, including $3.1 billion in 2023.\n\nIntel said it would slash 15% of its workforce to get costs under wraps.\n\n\"This is the biggest restructuring of Intel I'd say since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance following the results in early August.\n\nGelsinger says he's in it for the long haul despite being disappointed in the quarter and outlook.\n\n\"This is what I signed up for [when I came in as CEO],\" Gelsinger added.\n\nGelsinger is reportedly exploring an IPO of Intel's chipmaking business Altera and a possible sale of its foundry business to shore up investor confidence.\n\nIntel's stock is down by about 50% in the past year.

        "content": "AMD (AMD) chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su says her company is just getting started with the high-powered AI chip drops.\n\n\"We have accelerated our AI roadmap and are on a one year cadence of new products,\" Su told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Monday. \"It is an AI supercycle.\"\n\nLater this year, AMD will show off its MI325 AI chip followed by the MI350 next year and the MI400 in 2026 — taking aim at rival Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance.\n\nAdded Su, \"We believe we can have a very significant piece of the training and inference of these large language models.\"\n\nThe new MI chips teased by Su come hot on the heels of a successful debut of the MI300x release about a year ago. It can use up to 192GB of memory, and boasts an astounding 153 billion transistors.\n\nThe beefy memory capabilities mean AMD's AI chip could be used to train large language models — such as OpenAI's ChatGPT — commonly known as \"LLMs.\" This is a segment that has been dominated by Nvidia, but AMD is keen on carving out its own position in a rapidly growing marketplace.\n\nSu tells us AMD may notch $4.5 billion in sales from this chip alone in 2024, up from about $100 million in AI related chip revenue last year. The company's previous guidance for the MI300 was around $4 billion in sales this year.\n\nIt's the fastest-growing product in AMD's history, Su says.\n\n\"The MI300 guidance raise [in the second quarter] is a positive vs. falling expectations (including ours). AMD noted that supply/technical concerns are overstated and stated that they have not seen any cuts this year from their top customers (we believe Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META) and Oracle (ORCL) are top 3). We assume the street will stay around $5 billion this year, which still supports the potential for $8-9 billion next year,\" Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis said in a client note.\n\nThe momentum behind AI chips continues to power AMD's top and bottom lines.\n\nSecond quarter sales and earnings rose 9% and 19% year over year.\n\nAt the mid-point of its third quarter revenue outlook, AMD sees year over year growth of about 16% and sequential growth of approximately 15%.\n\n\"AI is a much larger cycle than I would have expected five years ago,\" Su says. \"We are making big bets now for the next five years.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "Nvidia stock sell-off is overdone, Goldman Sachs analyst says",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs isn't scared off by the latest Nvidia (NVDA) sell-off.\n\nNvidia shed roughly $400 billion in market value last week after the stock fell nearly 10% on Tuesday. The tech stock was one of the biggest drivers of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) worst start to September since 1953, according to Bespoke Investment Group, though it recovered some of its losses on Monday.\n\nDespite the selling, Toshiya Hari, a lead analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintained a Buy rating on the chip giant. When asked if the sell-off in Nvidia stock was overdone, Hari said, \"Yes, we do.\"\n\n\"The recent performance hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Hari told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons, the Googles, the Microsofts of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nNvidia's sell-off began when the company's better-than-expected earnings print on Aug. 28 just wasn't good enough for Wall Street. While Nvidia’s revenue beat Wall Street expectations by 4.1%, that was the smallest margin for the company since its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe big debate around Nvidia is whether its earnings momentum is sustainable. Hari said that investors are questioning whether that will be the case not only for 2025 but for 2026 too.\n\nInvestor sentiment on artificial intelligence has \"swung nearly 180 [degrees]\" since early 2023, Goldman's equity research team wrote in a recent note. Investors' patience is wearing thin, and they want to be shown — not told about — AI-driven revenue streams and profit margin improvements.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nStill, the Goldman team wrote, with a profound generational technology shift such as AI, \"it would be futile to pass judgment based on near-term cost and return economics.\"\n\nThe focus is on the long game: Goldman estimates that generative AI will begin materially contributing to sector growth by the second half of 2025.\n\n\"I think their competitive position continues to be really strong,\" Hari said of Nvidia. \"We do think within merchant silicon, Nvidia is the go-to, and even versus custom silicon, they've got the edge in terms of the pace of innovation.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the conference on Wednesday morning.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Hedge Funds Are Bullish On This Big Company Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other big company stocks.\n\nMega-cap stocks—major technology companies to be precise—continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500’s 40%+ gain.\n\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies’ stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\n\n3Q 2024 Earnings Season – A Preview\n\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\n\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks.  Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\n\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\n\nAmidst Worries, Investors Should Stick to Big Company Stocks\n\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\n\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\n\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\n\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the big and well-established companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Its chips are used in several end markets, such as high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been making investments for over a decade in its software capabilities in a unique way which has enabled its hardware to outperform regular silicon. This outperformance was seen because of software optimizations and acceleration libraries as these are regularly updated. GenAI continues to drive data center growth. The next-gen models require 10x-20x more compute and data, and this is where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s extremely powerful chips come to the rescue.\n\nUndoubtedly, the company’s strong position related to graphics processing units, and switching costs associated with its proprietary software, CUDA platform, for AI tools should act as critical growth enablers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs and software platforms should capitalize on the elevated demand for its AI applications, mainly in data centers where high-performance computing remains important. Spectrum-X, which is a high-performance Ethernet platform, has been gaining traction. Also, sovereign AI opportunities are expanding, with more and more countries prioritizing AI development.\n\nFor 3Q 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. During 1H 2025, the company returned $15.4 billion to shareholders via shares repurchases and cash dividends.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased their target price on shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $115.00 to $155.00, giving an “Overweight” rating on 29th August. Ithaka Group, an investment advisory firm, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best big company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Intel Corporation (INTC) Has Been ‘Rocked By Key Defections’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Hottest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against Jim Cramer’s other hot stock picks.\n\nIn a recent post of Jim Cramer’s Morning Thoughts, he highlighted the impact of recent economic data on market sentiment. The S&P 500 is poised to fall for the fourth day in a row, following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. The report revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs last month, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000.\n\n“The S&P 500 is tracking for a fourth straight day of declines after the highly anticipated August jobs report came up short. Bond yields also moved lower on the report. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% as expected.” Cramer said.\n\nDespite this shortfall, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%, aligning with predictions. Additionally, the job gains for June and July were revised downwards. As a result, traders are now split between anticipating a standard 25 basis point interest rate cut and a more substantial 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting on September 18.\n\n“Job gains in the June and July reports were also revised down Friday. Traders were split roughly evenly between a traditional 25 basis point interest rate cut and a larger 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Sept. 18.”\n\n“We Got What We Wanted, But the Market Crashed”\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how September 6 turned out to be a disappointing trading day. Despite hopes from bullish investors for a weak non-farm payrolls report that would encourage the Federal Reserve to cut rates, the actual report met these expectations.\n\n“What an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we’d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that’s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.” Said Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer pointed out that September is historically a weak month for the market due to significant profit-taking. Although it might seem circular to link September’s weakness to profit-taking, it’s more reasonable than attributing it solely to fears of a severe economic slowdown. Cramer emphasized that, despite the market’s dips, big tech companies, especially those involved in key trends like data centers and accelerated computing—should be considered as buying opportunities during these times.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This market has a September problem. Come September, we’re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it’s the weakest month of the year. I know that’s somewhat circular reasoning—we sell because we’ve always sold—but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you’re worried about a more severe slowdown.\n\nWhy? Well, because big tech is all about powerful secular themes that can keep going even during a recession—and we’re not getting one. I’m talking about the data center, accelerated computing—they’re not going anywhere. Nevertheless, when anything jars the big tech themes of the moment, the market’s reaction is swift, harsh, and horrible.”\n\nJim Cramer Urges Investors: “Do Not Abandon Ship”\n\nJim Cramer discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will offer new insights into inflation. He noted that if inflation stays steady or falls, the Federal Reserve will have more room to cut interest rates, which could help prevent a recession and address concerns from many sellers. Cramer encouraged investors to remain confident and avoid abandoning their positions due to these uncertainties.\n\n“Wednesday, we get another read on inflation—this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession—the thing so many sellers are worried about. That’s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Intel Corporation (INTC) Jim Cramer’s Hottest Stock Pick?\n\nA technician soldering components for a semiconductor board.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has been hit by major departures, including Stuart Pann, who was appointed head of the foundry business in 2023, and Shlomit Weiss, a key designer who left in April. Combined with the recent decline in stock prices, Jim Cramer noted that these challenges are making it harder for CEO Pat Gelsinger to execute his turnaround strategy at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\n“The Financial Times reports that Intel has been rocked by key defections, including Stuart Pann who was named head of the foundry business in 2023. Shlomit Weiss, a key designer, departed in April. Coupled with stock price declines, the deck looks increasingly stacked against CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plans.”\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a strong investment for 2024 due to its strategic transformation, strong market presence, and growth potential in key areas. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has restructured by focusing on core semiconductor and foundry services, which has boosted investor confidence and solidified its leadership in U.S. chip manufacturing. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) holds a significant market share in data centers and PCs and is making strides in the AI chip market, which NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently dominates.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s expansion in foundry services, supported by partnerships with Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the development of the Intel 18A process node, enhances its growth potential. Additionally, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s $10 billion cost-reduction plan is expected to improve efficiency, competitiveness, and profitability.\n\nAriel Global Fund stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alternatively, several positions weighed on performance. One of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), underperformed in the period on news of a longer than expected turnaround in profitability within the Foundry business. This was exacerbated by disappointing near-term guidance due to a weakening demand environment signaling an extended replacement cycle. We view the quarter as a temporary trough that should dissipate as we see signs of a cyclical recovery for personal computers (PCs) and central processing units (CPUs), driven by the Windows 11 upgrade.\n\nIn our view, the market is overlooking the progress Intel is making to advance its manufacturing process. Not to mention, the company’s efforts to serve as a viable second source foundry partner of leading-edge silicon. We believe the separation of the design and manufacturing businesses will be a key catalyst in unlocking improved financial performance while also enhancing the competitiveness of the foundry business.”\n\nOverall INTC ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer’s hottest stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The elite $100 billion club just lost three members. Here’s who fell off the list",
        "content": "The exclusive club of tycoons worth $100 billion or more just got a little bit smaller thanks to a stock market pullback.\n\nThere are now only 12 people in the 12-digit net worth clique, after three previous members fell off the list, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Although they’re still among the world’s richest people, as of Sunday, tech moguls Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Dell founder Michael Dell along with India’s second richest person Gautam Adani fell just short of the $100 billion mark.\n\nThe super wealthy shift comes as September takes its yearly toll on stocks. Last week, all major indices finished the week lower, with the S&P 500 falling 4.2% for the week. Uncertainty over the U.S. election and unemployment numbers threaten to push equities lower into next month.\n\nNvidia took a 14% dive last week and recorded the biggest ever single-day drop in history for an American company. With just over 3.5% ownership of the company, Huang’s net worth plummeted to $90.5 billion from $105 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDell’s net worth fell about $10 billion to $96.3 billion last week, according to Bloomberg, as shares fell Friday amid weakness in the tech sector. On Monday, Dell’s shares jumped about 3% on the news that it, along with data analytics company Palantir, would be joining the S&P 500.\n\nFinally, Adani teetered on the edge of the elite group of super wealthy magnates at $99.6 billion as of Sunday after India’s Nifty 50 index of the largest Indian companies recorded a three-day losing streak. The index was up less than 1% as of Monday’s close.\n\nIn May, the $100 billion club ballooned to 15 members, its highest number in history, thanks to stock market gains. Among the most recognized members are Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nAmong the ranks of the uber wealthy, tech moguls like Zuckerberg and Huang stand out for the biggest gains recorded so far this year. The 40-year old Zuckerberg’s net worth exploded by $50 billion so far this year, followed by Huang’s personal fortune, which jumped by $46 billion as Nvidia’s stock skyrocketed amid a broader AI boom.\n\nTogether, the wealth of the current 12 members of the $100 billion club is just under $1.9 trillion, which is a little more than Google’s market cap.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Wipes Out $400B in Value: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVDA Stock?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA witnessed a meteoric rise over the past few years due to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Its recent share repurchase has installed confidence among investors and the highly anticipated launch of the new Blackwell architecture should fuel its stock price.\n\nHowever, American regulators launched a probe into the tech giant’s contracts, which raised a lot of apprehensions about the NVIDIA stock’s future trajectory. NVIDIA’s shares were subjected to huge selloffs lately on Wall Street. So, is this the right time to sell the NVIDIA stock, or will remaining bullish be helpful? Let’s have a look –\n\nNVIDIA’s Volatility Dwarfs Its Peers\n\nNVIDIA saw around $406 billion being wiped out from its market value last week, which weighed heavily on Wall Street. The largest chipmaker witnessed wild swings in its share prices over the past 30 days that made even the most volatile asset, Bitcoin (BTC) look calm.\n\nNVIDIA’s 30-day realized volatility touched a two-year high, dwarfing the level of gyration among Magnificent 7 peers and meme stocks. The NVIDIA stock recorded its worst two-week stretch in two years on Friday after the U.S. Department of Justice summoned the chipmaker in an escalating antitrust issue.\n\nSeptember, anyhow, isn’t a good month for NVIDIA. According to the Dow Jones Market Data, the chipmaker’s shares, on average, declined 2.4% in September, more than the broader S&P 500’s decline of 1.2%. However, the long run bodes well for the NVIDIA stock that has rewarded investors handsomely this year, with its shares up more than 100% so far.\n\nShare Repurchase Plan – A Good Sign for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA recently approved a new $50 billion share repurchase. This indicated that the management is hopeful about the company’s future business endeavors.\n\nStock buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares and jack up the value of the remaining shares, a blessing for shareholders. After all, decreasing the number of outstanding shares leads to an increase in share prices.\n\nAnyhow, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, signifying a long-term uptrend (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA’s Blackwell to be Groundbreaking\n\nNVIDIA is all set to launch its cutting-edge Blackwell AI chip later this year, and that can be a game changer. This is because Blackwell is more than just a graphic processing unit (GPU). Its platform will provide more AI throughput than the present Hopper platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new Blackwell GPU will offer high-speed communication and greater processing power, which are needs of the hour. And if history repeats itself, the Blackwell launch would lead to an uptick in NVIDIA’s share prices. After all, NVIDIA’s shares did soar by double-digits in the three months following the launch of the previous two platforms – Hopper and Ampere.\n\n2 More Reasons to be Bullish on the NVIDIA Stock\n\nCEO, Jensen Huang recently said that a huge chunk of data would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs, a blessing for NVIDIA. This is because NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in GPUs. The GPU market size is expected to grow to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $56.55 billion in 2023, per Precedence Research.\n\nGPU Market Size 2023 to 2034 (USD Billion) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Precedence Research\n\nNVIDIA’s move to enter the ever-growing gaming space with product line, GeForce, and industrial metaverse in collaboration with Siemens will act as a tailwind for the company. Hence, NVIDIA’s earnings outlook for the current year looks promising, with the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s earnings per share up 76.1% year over year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Stock is Pricey – Is it the Right Time to Buy?\n\nGiven the positives, the NVIDIA stock is destined to scale upward despite facing bouts of volatility in recent times. Notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 39.2% from the stock’s last closing price of $107.21. The highest price target is set at $200, an upside of 86.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, NVIDIA stock at the moment is expensive compared to its arch-rivals. As per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. But its rivals, QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM and Broadcom Inc.’s AVGO forward earnings multiples are 15.8X and 28.9X, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, investors should wait for the current entry point or let NVIDIA’s shares fall further so that purchasing the shares doesn’t burn a hole in their pockets. And those who have already bought NVIDIA’s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as demand for AI models is here to stay.\n\nNVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Volvo Deepens Ties With NVIDIA, Revises Outlook for 2026 &amp; Beyond",
        "content": "Volvo VLVLY provided several updates regarding its electric vehicle (EV) goals, including an expanded partnership with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA to enhance the core computing system for its EX90 SUV.\r\n\r\nLater in the decade, Volvo plans to produce vehicles using NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, which incorporates the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU architecture. This technology will allow Volvo to implement more advanced driving systems, such as autonomous driving and generative AI features.\r\n\r\nTo improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs, Volvo will use a unified tech and software platform called the Superset tech stack for all its vehicles. This single platform, adaptable to different models, will streamline Volvo's engineering efforts by focusing them on a common direction, rather than individual car projects.\r\n\r\nVolvo’s EV models will be built on an electric technology platform called SPA3, which will be supported by the Superset tech stack. The first vehicle based on SPA3 will be the all-electric EX60 midsize SUV.\n\nVolvo Revises Financial Outlook for 2026 and Beyond\n\nVolvo revised its financial targets for 2026 and beyond to respond to shifting market dynamics. The company now aims for an EBIT margin of 7-8% for fiscal 2026, down from its previous target of 8% or more. VLVLY also aims for cash flow neutrality in 2024 and 2025, with strong free cash flow expected starting in 2026. The company has scrapped its earlier sales target of $53.5-$58.4 billion and now focuses on outpacing the growth of the premium car market through 2026.\r\n\r\nVolvo has also adjusted its EV sales targets in response to evolving market conditions and customer preferences. The company now expects 50-60% of its global sales to be EVs, both fully electric and plug-in hybrids, by 2025.\r\n\r\nBy 2030, Volvo anticipates that EVs will comprise 90-100% of its global sales. If required, the remaining 10% will allow for the sales of mild hybrid models. These new goals are aimed at reducing VLVLY's carbon emissions per vehicle by 30-35% by 2025 and 65-75% by 2030.\r\n\r\nPer Jim Rowan, CEO of Volvo, the shift to electrification will not be linear, with different markets and customers transitioning at varying speeds.\n\nVLVLY Reports Rise in August Sales on Rising EV Deliveries\n\nVolvo reported a 3% year-over-year increase in global sales for August, totaling 52,944 vehicles, driven by strong EV sales in Europe despite challenges in the Chinese market.\r\n\r\nEV sales, including plug-in hybrids and fully electric vehicles, rose 47% and accounted for 47% of all cars sold in August, with fully electric vehicles making up 25% of total sales.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, sales increased 32% year over year, with EV sales up 52%. In the United States, overall sales declined 2% year over year, but plug-in hybrid sales surged 84%. Sales in China fell 23% year over year, although electrified model sales rose 10%.\r\n\r\nVolvo's best-selling model was the XC60, followed by the XC40/EX40 and EX30.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nVLVLY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the auto space are Dorman Products, Inc. DORM and Douglas Dynamics, Inc. PLOW, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for DORM’s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 3.71% and 35.46%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025 have improved 51 cents and 37 cents, respectively, in the past 60 days.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLOW’s 2024 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 60.4%.

        "title": "Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, NVIDIA fair value estimate is US$95.76 With US$103 share price, NVIDIA appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for NVDA is US$149, which is 55% above our fair value estimate\n\nDoes the September share price for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$60.1b US$82.5b US$102.7b US$119.1b US$131.4b US$141.8b US$150.8b US$158.6b US$165.5b US$171.9b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x15 Analyst x9 Analyst x2 Est @ 10.30% Est @ 7.96% Est @ 6.32% Est @ 5.18% Est @ 4.37% Est @ 3.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9%  US$55.8k US$70.9k US$81.8k US$87.9k US$89.9k US$90.0k US$88.7k US$86.5k US$83.6k US$80.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$815b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$172b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.5%) = US$3.3t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.5t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$103, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.306. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for NVIDIA\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nNo apparent threats visible for NVDA.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "title": "Best Leveraged ETFs of Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street was downbeat last week. The S&P 500 posted its worst week in 18 months after weak U.S. jobs data triggered Fed rate cut debates and the tech sector slumped. Tech king NVIDIA NVDA (down 13.9% last week) caused market uncertainty amid concerns that prices soared on the boom around artificial intelligence (AI), and weighed on the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell 5.8% last week and the Dow Jones declined 2.9%. The Labor Department reported that U.S. employment increased less than expected in August while the jobless rate declined in line with expectations to 4.2% from 4.3% in July, suggesting a slowdown in the labor market.\n\nNonfarm payrolls rose 142,000 in August but fell short of the 160,000 increase that economists polled by Reuters had expected while July numbers were revised down to 89,000 from 114,000. Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed that U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than expected by economists.\n\nThe closely watched jobs data showed labor market momentum slowing more than expected, indicating that it is tough for the United States to achieve a soft landing. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few leveraged ETFs that gained last week.\n\nBest-Performing Leveraged ETFs in Focus\n\n2x Long VIX Futures ETF (UVIX) – Up 51.1%\n\nThe underlying Long VIX Futures Index expresses the daily performance of a theoretical portfolio of the first and second-month VIX futures contracts that are rolled daily. The expense ratio of the ETF is 2.31%.\n\nDirexion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares (SOXS) – Up 39.7%\n\nThe underlying ICE Semiconductor Index measures the performance of the semiconductor sub-sector of the U.S. equity market. The expense ratio of the ETF is 1.03% annually. The ETF yields 9.66% annually.\n\nGraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) – Up 31.1%\n\nThe GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of -2 times the daily percentage change of the common stock of NVIDIA Corp. The expense ratio of the ETF is 1.50% annually. The ETF yields 60.34% annually.\n\nProShares UltraShort Ether ETF (ETHD) – Up 25.9%\n\nThe underlying Bloomberg Ethereum Index measures the performance of a single ether traded in USD and seeks to provide a proxy for the ether market. The expense ratio of the ETF is 1.01%. The ETF yields 3.47% annually.\n\nDirexion Daily Technology Bear 3X Shares (TECS) – Up 24.4%\n\nThe underlying Technology Select Sector Index includes domestic companies from the following industries: computers & peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors & semiconductor equipment; internet software & services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments & components; wireless telecommunication services; & office electronics. The expense ratio of the ETF is 1.10%. The ETF yields 5.72% annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Which Stock-Split Stock Does Wall Street Like the Most: Nvidia, Broadcom, or Supermicro?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), and Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) (also known as Supermicro) share several things in common. All three companies have profited from the surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI). All three have declared 10-for-1 stock splits in 2024. Each stock has soared this year but pulled back significantly in recent weeks.\n\nAnother common denominator between Nvidia, Broadcom, and Supermicro is that they've all been favored by analysts. But which stock-split stock does Wall Street like the most now?\n\nThe winner based on buy recommendations\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to determine which of these stocks Wall Street is most bullish about is to look at the buy recommendations for each stock. And one of them appears to be the hands-down winner.\n\nOf the 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in September who cover Broadcom, 10 rate the stock as a \"strong buy.\" Another 17 recommend Broadcom as a \"buy.\" In other words, 93% of analysts like the stock. By the way, none of the surveyed analysts recommend selling Broadcom. The two outliers rate the stock as a \"hold.\"\n\nNvidia comes in a distant second place. LSEG surveyed 38 analysts this month who cover the stock. Seven recommended Nvidia as a \"strong buy\" with another 14 recommending it as a \"buy.\" That's 55% of analysts with a positive view. Most of the other analysts rate Nvidia as a \"hold.\" However, one analyst pegged the stock as an \"underperform\" with another recommending selling it.\n\nThat leaves Supermicro in the third spot. Of the six analysts surveyed by LSEG in September, only two (33%) recommended buying the stock. The other four analysts rated Supermicro as a \"hold.\"\n\nThe winner based on price targets\n\nHowever, there is another method to assess what Wall Street thinks about stocks. While analysts make buy, hold, or sell recommendations (or their equivalents), they also issue 12-month price targets.\n\nUsing this approach, Supermicro comes out on top. The average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 105%. The most optimistic analyst thinks Supermicro's share price can increase by more than 3.6x.\n\nNvidia is again the runner-up. Wall Street's average price target for the stock is roughly 22% above the current share price. However, one especially exuberant analyst predicts Nvidia will soar 69% higher.\n\nBroadcom was first based on analysts' buy recommendations but came in last based on price targets. The average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of 15%. That's not bad, but it's well below the targets for Supermicro and Nvidia. The most upbeat analyst thinks Broadcom can rise another 42% or so over the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nControversy, concerns, and confidence\n\nThe main reason a smaller percentage of analysts recommend buying Supermicro is the controversy that recently erupted with a short-seller's allegations about accounting manipulation by the company. I suspect the 12-month price targets don't fully reflect this news yet. It's too soon to know how things will shake out. Investors might want to heed the advice of most analysts to hold Supermicro if they own it or hold off on buying it for now if they don't.\n\nNvidia's middle-of-the-pack rankings stem in part from Wall Street's concerns about the company's declining gross margin and the potential for a recession. I don't think investors should worry about the slipping margin. For one thing, it's still really high (75.1% in Q2). Nvidia also has its new Blackwell chips on the way, which should boost margins.\n\nWhat about the possibility that the U.S. could enter a recession? I wouldn't rule it out. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates soon -- a move that could help prevent a recession.\n\nI agree with analysts' overall bullishness about Nvidia and Broadcom. Both companies' businesses continue to perform well. I think investors have reasons for confidence about their growth prospects. I don't know if Nvidia or Broadcom will hit Wall Street's price targets, but I wouldn't bet against either of these stocks.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia and Broadcom: Wall Street's 2 Newest Stock-Split Stocks Are Taking Center Stage This Week",
        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been the talk of Wall Street for much of the last two years, the euphoria surrounding companies enacting stock splits has been an equally important catalyst for the stock market in 2024.\n\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies have at their disposal that allows them to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. It's cosmetic in the sense that stock splits have no impact on a company's market cap or its underlying operating performance.\n\nThere are two classes of stock splits, one of which investors gravitate to far more than the other. Reverse-stock splits have a goal of increasing a company's share price, often to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange. Comparatively, forward-stock splits reduce a company's share price, usually with the purpose of making shares more nominally affordable for retail investors and/or employees. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhereas reverse-stock splits are usually undertaken from a position of operating weakness, companies conducting forward splits are typically out-executing their competition and on the leading edge of the innovative curve within their respective industry. Long story short, investors often flock to companies completing forward-stock splits.\n\nSince 2024 began, 13 exceptional businesses have announced or completed a stock split, 12 of which are of the forward-split variety. While none of these are probably better-known than AI leaders Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), the attention this week turns to Wall Street's two newest members of the stock-split club.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom were Wall Street's most-anticipated stock splits\n\nThe hype surrounding AI is so thick investors could arguably cut it with a knife. Since the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 639%, as of the closing bell on Sept. 3, with Broadcom rising by a not-too-shabby 173%. Such monstrous gains coerced Nvidia to complete a 10-for-1 forward split in early June, while Broadcom conducted its first-ever split, also of the 10-for-1 variety, in mid-July.\n\nThe fuel behind Nvidia's epic run that saw it, at least briefly, become the largest publicly traded company is its top-tier graphics processing units (GPUs). The company's H100 GPU is the preferred choice in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nMore importantly, demand for the H100 and successor Blackwell platform, which is set to make its debut in the early part of 2025, are backlogged. When demand for a product handily outstrips its supply, the price of that good tends to climb. The H100 GPU typically costs between 100% to 200% more than Advanced Micro Devices' MI300X AI-GPU. For Nvidia, this has led to a sizable uptick in its gross margin since 2023 began.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for Broadcom, it's stepped up as the preferred provider of AI networking solutions. The Jericho3-AI fabric, which was introduced in the second quarter of 2023, is able to connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers. The goal for Broadcom's solutions is to reduce tail latency and help businesses get as much computing capacity as possible out of their GPUs.\n\nHowever, Broadcom has a considerably more diverse revenue stream than Nvidia. It's one of the leading providers of wireless chips and accessories used in 5G-capable smartphones, and provides a wide assortment of optical components and networking solutions to industrial and automotive companies.\n\nBut Nvidia and Broadcom have had their moment in the spotlight as stock-split stocks. This week, two new companies are set to take center stage. Image source: Sirius XM.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nOne of Wall Street's newest stock-split stocks, and the only one of the 13 set to complete a reverse split, is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nSirius XM is the final inning of its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group(NASDAQ: LSXMA)(NASDAQ: LSXMB)(NASDAQ: LSXMK), which is expected to stop trading after the closing bell on Sept. 9. This merger is being undertaken to create a unified class of Sirius XM common stock.\n\nUpon completion of this merger -- i.e., following the close of trading on Sept. 9 -- Sirius XM will conduct a 1-for-10 reverse-stock split.\n\nAlthough I did note that reverse splits are usually undertaken from a position of operating weakness, this isn't the case with Sirius XM, which is in danger of delisting. The company has approximately 3.85 billion outstanding shares, which has held its share price firmly in the mid-single digits for over a decade. Some institutional investors may view stocks with a low share price as too risky. This coming split, which will lift its share price by a factor of 10, should put the company on the radar of bigger-money investors.\n\nDespite no longer growing at a rapid pace, Sirius XM still enjoys a number of competitive advantages. For instance, being the only licensed satellite-radio operator affords a level of subscription pricing power that virtually ensures it stays ahead of the inflationary curve. With Spotify Technology recently increasing its subscription cost, Sirius XM looks like a good bet to follow suit and raise its prices in the months to come.\n\nSirius XM also generates its revenue in a markedly different fashion than traditional radio operators. Whereas most terrestrial and online radio providers heavily rely on advertising revenue to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in roughly 77% of its net sales through the first six months of 2024 from subscriptions.\n\nWhile an ad-driven operating model works well during lengthy periods of economic expansion, it can lead to turmoil during inevitable downturns in the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, Sirius XM's subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service than businesses are to reduce their marketing budget when economic uncertainty rears its head. In short, Sirius XM has a safer floor than its peers.\n\nCintas\n\nThe other stock-split stock that'll be taking center stage this week is corporate uniform and business services leader Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS).\n\nOn May 2, the company's board approved a 4-for-1 stock split, which is set to take place following the close of trading on Sept. 11. This will mark the sixth time Cintas has split its stock since its August 1983 initial public offering (IPO). With the company's shares rising by nearly 84,000% since its IPO, or 124,800%, including dividends, a stock split is very much needed.\n\nAlthough supplying corporate uniforms and various business accessories, such as floor mats and safety kits, isn't a groundbreaking operating model, Cintas is able to take advantage of the non-linear nature of the economic cycle.\n\nSince World War II ended 79 years ago, only three of 12 U.S. recessions have made it to the 12-month mark, with none enduring longer than 18 months. On the other side of the coin, most economic expansions have stuck around for multiple years, including two periods of growth that topped the 10-year mark. Disproportionately long growth spurts favor companies like Cintas that are tied to the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nAnother reason for the nearly parabolic climb in Cintas's stock is its customer diversity. Cintas claims to serve more than 1 million businesses. This means no single customer is vital to its success, or capable of capsizing the proverbial ship.\n\nInorganic growth has been another key catalyst for Cintas. Management has overseen a number of acquisitions since this century began, including Zee Medical in 2015 and G&K Services in 2017. In addition to being earnings-accretive, these acquisitions have helped expand Cintas's product ecosystem, as well as promoted cross-selling opportunities.\n\nThis week, it's all about Sirius XM and Cintas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Doubled Its Money on This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Should You Buy It Too?",
        "content": "Back in February, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) released its first-ever 13-F filing, which revealed that the company bought a handful of stocks in the final quarter of 2023. Each of them has a presence in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, so it's a good way for Nvidia to capture value from that space outside its core semiconductor business.\n\nNvidia bought 1.7 million shares of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), which were valued at $3.6 million at the end of 2023. With SoundHound stock now trading at $4.50, Nvidia's position is worth around $7.8 million -- implying a whopping 116% gain in less than a year.\n\nSoundHound is a specialist in conversational AI, and it has accumulated an impressive list of customers. The company's revenue is growing quickly, and management's forecast for the future is incredibly strong. So should investors follow Nvidia into the stock? Image source: Nvidia.\n\nA leader in conversational AI\n\nSoundHound has developed a suite of conversational AI products for companies in the hospitality, automotive, and food service industries. They are trained to recognize voice inputs and respond in kind, so the user can leverage the power of AI without having to type a single word.\n\nRestaurant chains use SoundHound AI to autonomously take customer orders in the drive-thru and in-store, which reduces the workload on employees. Family sports bar and grill chain Beef 'O' Brady's just rolled out SoundHound's AI ordering system across all corporate locations, and it has given franchisees the option to use it, too.\n\nMany restaurants also use SoundHound's Employee Assist software, which is custom trained for each location to give workers information about the menu, internal policies, and more. Chipotle, Krispy Kreme, and Five Guys are just some of SoundHound's other notable restaurant customers.\n\nOn the automotive side, SoundHound's Chat AI voice assistant is now live across six brands from Stellantis, including Peugeot and Alfa Romeo. It's capable of feeding the driver information on a variety of topics on command, whether it's the weather, sports scores, or the status of an upcoming flight. Plus, SoundHound's AI Vehicle Intelligence product is trained on the manual of each vehicle, so drivers can instantly access information about its features.\n\nAt the beginning of August, SoundHound announced the acquisition of Amelia, an AI company that helps businesses create and deploy virtual agents to serve their customers and employees. The combined companies will serve hundreds of customers, and the deal will expand SoundHound's reach into other industries like healthcare, insurance, financial services, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound is growing rapidly\n\nSoundHound generated $13.5 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2024, a whopping 54% increase from the year-ago period. The strong result (combined with the acquisition of Amelia) prompted management to increase its full-year guidance for both 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe company now expects to bring in $80 million this year, which would be a 74.3% increase from its 2023 result, followed by at least $150 million in 2025 (including $45 million from Amelia), which will represent accelerated growth of 87.5%.\n\nPlus, SoundHound ended Q2 with a record $723 million in bookings, which nearly doubled from the year-ago period. Bookings represent the company's order backlog, so its long-term revenue pipeline also looks very robust.\n\nHowever, SoundHound's bottom line is a concern because the company is still investing heavily in growth at the expense of profitability, and will probably continue doing so until it achieves scale. That resulted in a $37.3 million net loss during Q2, which was a 60% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nThe company's non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net loss -- which strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation -- was better, coming in at just $14.8 million, a slight improvement from $16 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nSoundHound ended Q2 with $200 million in cash on its balance sheet, so it can afford to sustain losses for the foreseeable future. However, there is a risk the company will require a capital raise at some point in the future prior to achieving sustained profitability, and that typically dilutes existing investors.\n\nThe stock might deserve a small spot in your portfolio\n\nBased on SoundHound's trailing-12-month revenue of $55.4 million and market capitalization of $1.6 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 29.1. That makes it even more expensive than Nvidia, which trades at a P/S multiple of 27.3! Considering that Nvidia operates at the forefront of the AI industry and has a track record of success that spans decades, it would seem unreasonable for SoundHound stock to trade at a premium valuation.\n\nHowever, SoundHound's revenue growth is actually poised to outpace Nvidia's in 2025 (so long as management's guidance is accurate). Based on SoundHound's $80 million in forecast 2024 revenue, its stock trades at a forward P/S ratio of 20.1. Its P/S ratio falls even further to just 10.7 based on the company's forecast 2025 revenue.\n\nTherefore, investors willing to hold SoundHound stock for at least the next two years might be scooping up a bargain at the current price. The story looks even more promising over the longer term, because the company believes enterprise spending on AI will top $250 billion within the next three years.\n\nWith all that said, I want to end with a very important point. SoundHound is still in the early stages of monetizing its AI products, and the journey won't always be smooth. So it might be best for investors to keep their position sizing small to mitigate the potential risks. After all, not even Nvidia has gone all in -- it's a $2.6 trillion company, so it probably won't sweat the $3.6 million loss if its investment in SoundHound stock doesn't work out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 9, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Nvidia NVDA, Spotify Technology S.A. SPOT and AppLovin Corp. APP.\n\n3 Strong Tech Stocks to Buy in September: TSM, SPOT, APP\n\nToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores the selloff to start September and where the stock market might be headed in the near term. The episode also digs into three Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) technology stocks—Taiwan Semiconductor, Spotify, and AppLovin—that investors might want to buy now in September and hold for long-term upside.\n\nTime to Buy Taiwan Semiconductor Stock and Hold Forever?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. physically builds the most advanced, complicated, and microscopic components that drive the global economy and technological progress. TSMC reportedly earned 61% of the semiconductor foundry market share in the fourth quarter of 2023, blowing away second-place Samsung’s 14%.\n\nTaiwan Semi is nearly unrivaled, expanding its moat around cutting-edge manufacturing by ramping up its industry-leading 3-nanometer technology.\n\nTaiwan Semi’s clients include AI powerhouse Nvidia, Apple, and other tech giants, making TSM stock a play on many of the biggest growth areas across the economy.\n\nTaiwan Semi is crucially addressing geopolitical fears by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan, which is supported by its robust balance sheet and government incentives.\n\nTaiwan Semi posted a beat-and-raise second quarter, driven by strong AI demand and beyond. Taiwan Semi’s upward EPS revisions earn TSM a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Taiwan Semi is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 25% in 2024 and 28% in 2025 on the back of 24% revenue growth in both years.\n\nTaiwan Semi stock more than doubled the Zacks Tech sector over the last 10 years and nearly tripled it during the past two decades. TSM stock has climbed 60% YTD, yet it trades 15% below its July highs and 27% below its average Zacks price target.\n\nTaiwan Semi trades at a 40% discount to its 10-year highs at 20.9X forward 12-month earnings and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nWhy Spotify Technology Stock is a Strong Buy\n\nSpotify Technology S.A. was one of the pioneers of paid streaming music, helping alter the music industry in the same way Netflix changed TV and movies. Despite competition from tech giants, Spotify reportedly held 32% of the global streaming music market share in 2023, blowing away No. 2 Apple Music’s 15%, as well as YouTube’s 14% and Amazon’s 13%.\n\nSpotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 80% between Q2 FY20 and Q2 FY24, while monthly active users surged 110%.\n\nSpotify's commitment to efficiency and price hikes in back-to-back years have helped it reach a profitability inflection point. SPOT’s FY24 EPS estimate has surged 28% since its Q2 release, with its FY25 figure 22% higher, helping it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nSPOT’s recent bottom-line revisions are part of an impressive trend that’s seen its FY24 EPS estimate skyrocket 930% over the last 12 months, with its FY25 figure up 280%.\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$6.37 per share in 2024 and then surge 38% next year. Spotify is projected to grow its revenue by 19% in 2024 and 15% next year to reach $20 billion—doubling revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify stock has soared over 300% off its 2022 lows, including a 75% YTD climb. Yet Spotify trades around 10% below its 2021 peaks and 15% under its average Zacks price target.\n\nSpotify trades at a 75% discount to its 12-month highs at 44.1X forward 12-month earnings. On top of that, Spotify trades at a 40% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 41% vs. its highs at 3.5X forward 12-month sales.\n\nWhy AppLovin is a Must-Own Under-the-Radar Tech Stock\n\nAppLovin Corp. helps companies and app developers acquire and keep their ideal users, increase value across a customer’s lifecycle, measure their marketing and reach, and much more. AppLovin’s new machine learning and AI engine AXON 2.0 is generating impressive results for its clients in mobile gaming and beyond.\n\nAppLovin grew its revenue by 17% last year, following slightly higher 2022 sales and 93% growth in 2021. The app monetization company posted another beat-and-raise quarter in early August, pointing to its potential to expand its market share in mobile gaming and grow into new advertising categories.\n\nAPP’s FY24 and FY25 earnings estimates surged 14% and 17%, respectively since its last release, with both estimates up 150% from a year ago.

        "title": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Redditors Are Bullish On This AI Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging. Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\n\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\n\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“A recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google’s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.”\n\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\n\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\n\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\n\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\n\nA distinguished MIT professor, Frédo Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\n\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\n\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a major semiconductor company that designs and manufactures microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and other computing components, and is known for its competitive products in the gaming and high-performance computing markets.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with Q2 results, where the data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year. Overall revenue growth was 8.88% for the quarter, recording a total revenue of $5.84 billion. This was $113.81 million higher than estimates. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over the year. Gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, but Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nThe 2023 launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators, designed for AI and HPC workloads, is still a major contributor to the company's growth.  This chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. The company now plans on releasing new AI chips annually, including the MI325X by the end of 2024, the MI350 in 2025 (a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell), and the MI400 in 2026.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush believes that the company's strong results and AI investments suggest a promising future in the AI market. He expects it to benefit significantly from the growing AI spending, which is estimated to reach $1 trillion over the next few years. Investors seem to follow the same opinion, as 108 hedge funds held long positions in this company by June 30. Fisher Asset Management had the largest stake, valued at $3,755,355,818.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investorletter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall AMD ranks 6th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer and manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are essential for rendering graphics, but now they're also used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data centers.\n\nIn FQ2 2025, the company recorded a rather higher year-over-year improvement of 122.40% in revenue. The revenue generated in this period was $30.04 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.29 billion. Data center revenue was up 54% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45%  of data center revenue.\n\nDespite such growth, the company's shares fell following this report. This is because investors had concerns about Blackwell chip production and slowing data center growth. Still, its shares were held by 179 hedge funds. Fisher Asset Management is the biggest shareholder with shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30. Later in late August, management approved a buyback of $50 billion in equity shares.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces pressure to launch new products to maintain investor confidence. Factors like delays in Blackwell chip production and concerns about high GPU prices are what impact the demand. While CUDA software is a competitive advantage, the company's future success depends on continued innovation and effective AI monetization. Market experts are also forecasting a shift to robotics for the company's growth. Management expects AI revenue to reach low-double-digit billions this year.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA): An Unstoppable AI Stock To Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other unstoppable AI stocks.\n\nIs Predictive AI Taking Over GenAI?\n\nGenerative AI is taking the world by storm. This groundbreaking technology is capable of creating new content, such as text, images, and even music, based on the patterns it learns from existing data. The impact of this advancement in AI on businesses has been profound, with businesses using it to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and generate innovative solutions through personalized content.\n\nWhile there are still challenges, GenAI's potential is undeniable. AI companies have rolled out GenAI platforms, integrating large language models in them, that are a click away from the general public's access. We talked about this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“Large language models are a type of AI that uses deep learning techniques and massive datasets to understand, generate, and predict human language. They’re trained for all of this through statistical relationships from vast amounts of text. The reason why they became so popular in such a short time is because they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or understand language better through specific prompts. LLMs like Gemini and ChatGPT-4 are Multimodal AI platforms that allow processing and generating multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, audio, and visual inputs.”\n\nGenAI has been popular recently due to advancements that have brought us models like ChatGPT-4, but predictive AI (or enterprise machine learning) has been prevalent in the business world for a longer period. It's been used extensively for tasks like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, and market analysis. GenAI excels at creating new content, but predictive AI is better suited for tasks that involve forecasting future trends or predicting outcomes based on historical data.\n\nMature organizations with streamlined processes use predictive AI as it helps deliver high returns and improve the customer experience. Forbes reported that UPS saves $35 million annually by optimizing package delivery planning. A medium-sized bank could save $16 million annually by predicting fraudulent transactions. A marketing campaign could increase profit 5x by predicting consumer behavior.\n\nGenAI spending was less than 7% of predictive AI last year. However, predictive AI's potential remains largely untapped due to challenges in operationalization. It can operate autonomously, while GenAI often requires human oversight. It is also cheaper and has a smaller footprint than the latter. The global predictive AI market is expected to grow from $14.9 billion in 2023 to $108 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of 21.9% from 2024 to 2033, according to a report published by market.us.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle AI's investment of $100 billion in responsible AI initiatives, focusing on areas like healthcare, climate change, and cybersecurity, indicates this sector's importance and potential. Similarly, SoftBank's $3.5 billion fund for predictive AI startups and Sequoia Capital's substantial investment in PreCog are also examples of this. In 2023, the Large Enterprises segment captured more than a 65% share in the Predictive AI market.\n\nPredictive AI is used for large-scale operations, learning from data to predict outcomes and behaviors, and guiding millions of daily operational decisions. Such use cases are further a testament to how artificial intelligence is now an integral part of major industries of the world, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of 15 AI stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and had gained at least 30% year to date. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the year-to-date performance, as of September 4.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nPerformance (Year-to-Date) as of September 4: 118.08%\n\nNVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing, specializing in products and platforms for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. In other words, it's a designer and manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nGenAI is driving data center growth. Next-gen models need 10-20x more compute and data and that's where Nvidia comes in with its extremely powerful chips.\n\nIn FQ2 2025, there was a 122.40% year-over-year improvement in the company's revenue. Data center revenue alone was up 54%. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45%  of data center revenue. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, and networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year.\n\nIn August, management approved a buyback of $50 billion in equity shares. Its shares were held by 179 hedge funds. Fisher Asset Management is the biggest shareholder with shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30.\n\nThe company unveiled Blackwell, a new architecture for AI factories and data centers. It combines multiple GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, and networking components to power next-GenAI. The GB 200 NVL72 system delivers up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs and workloads.\n\nDemand for Blackwell and Hopper is strong, with Blackwell production starting in FQ4. Spectrum-X, a high-performance Ethernet platform, is gaining traction in the market. Sovereign AI opportunities are expanding as countries prioritize AI development.\n\nNVIDIA Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) future success depends on continued innovation in AI. Market experts are forecasting a shift to robotics for the company's growth. Management expects AI revenue to reach low-double-digit billions this year.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the unstoppable AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Redditors Think This Stock Will Go To The Moon",
        "content": "We recently published a list of10 Stocks That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks.\n\nFINRA Investor Education Foundation and CFA Institute (2023) revealed that ~37% of Gen-Z investors in the US and ~38% in the UK come to social media influencers regarding investment decisions. Therefore, it is important to explore the role finfluencers (influencers sharing financial advice on social media) play in providing investment information and how Gen-Z investors engage with finfluencers. Young investors are considering memes and viral videos as the primary source of investment advice.\n\nSocial Media and Investments: Do They Complement Each Other?\n\nExperts believe that retail or non-professional investors are now becoming dependent on digital channels, like social media platforms such as TikTok, when it comes to investing.\n\nFINRA revealed that ~60% of US investors under age 35 believe that social media can be used as a source of investment information. This compares to ~57% who use finance professionals. This increase is probably because digital channels are becoming easily accessible, with ~60% of the global population utilizing social media (as per DataReportal).\n\nQuick-scroll websites are now considered the go-to spot for investment ideas and inspiration. This is because of their bite-sized format and easy access. Ofcom, which tracks news consumption in the UK – revealed that TikTok’s reach for news went up from ~1% in 2020 to ~7% in 2022. This was mainly seen in younger folks aged between 16 – 24 years. Pew Research mentioned that, in the US, this increased from ~3% in 2020 to ~10% in 2022.\n\nFinancial advice content, which is shared on social media, has been contributing to the growth of the “creator economy,” which is pegged at ~$127 billion globally (as per Coherent Market Insights). This is expected to reach US$528.39 billion by 2030, with growth stemming from higher demand for user-generated content and increased monetization opportunities. Financial institutions and investment advisory companies are now focusing on creating pathways from social media to their product and services to exploit strong market opportunities. Therefore, most retail investors continue to make investing decisions under social media’s influence.\n\nRetail Traders Making a Significant Portion in The US Stock Options\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. highlighted that non-professional investors are now making a bigger part of the US options market as they continue to pour money mainly into short-term bets and technology stocks. The bank highlighted that retail traders accounted for ~18.3% of the total options activity in June. Social media and online investing communities have influenced retail investors to the extent that these investors don’t shy away from making investments in the downturn.\n\nIn late July and early August 2024, when there was a sharp decline in popular technology shares, retail investors turned out to be net buyers.\n\nVanda Research mentioned that individual investors, who were caught up in the market downturn, continued to be net buyers of shares of leading technology and AI-related companies. Just to balance out the risks, retail investors directed significant buying to an ETF tracking 20-Y Treasury bonds. Wall Street experts and enthusiasts believe that this confidence comes from the online investing communities and social media platforms, where there were discussions about going long on leading technology shares as they were trading at “decent levels.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) The Stock That Will Go to the Moon According to Reddit?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a technology company. It is engaged in developing a platform for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, and focuses on PC graphics.\n\nThe company’s intangible assets associated with its graphics processing units and increased switching costs concerning its proprietary software are expected to act as principal growth enablers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s roots revolve around gaming, and the company’s patents related to hardware design helped it achieve market leading position in gaming GPUs. As a result of this dominant position, the company was able to build economies of scale and invest in R&D efforts.\n\nSpectrum-X Ethernet for Al and NVIDIA Al Enterprise software are the new product categories that are achieving significant scale. This demonstrates that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a full-stack and data center-scale platform.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s advanced intellectual property has created significant barriers to entry, which was evident when Intel decided to license IP from this tech giant. Notably, the data centers remain critical to power Al systems which can perform difficult tasks, such as speech recognition and photo recognition. Therefore, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to focus on leveraging its GPU prowess in emerging areas like data centers and automotive.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that a new class of products, data processing units (DPUs), can handle certain tasks. This will allow CPUs to focus on core applications. These analysts anticipate that DPUs will become commonplace in all servers.\n\nFor 3Q 2025, the company’s revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins should be in the range of 74.4% and 75.0%. In 2Q 2025, the company saw record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, exhibiting a rise of 15% from 1Q 2025 and 122% YoY. The revenues were supported by global data centers, which continue to focus on modernizing the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative Al.\n\nUBS Group upped their price objective on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from $120.00 to $150.00. They gave a “Buy” rating on 8th July.\n\nFred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia’s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will go to the moon. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years.\n\nGrowing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn’t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly.\n\nPricing Power Remains Critical, Says Legendary Investor\n\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn’t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.\n\nThe veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers.\n\nForecasts for 2024\n\nWall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched.\n\nMoving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points.\n\nEquity Market Outlook Amidst Uncertain Macro-Economic Environment\n\nA “higher-for-longer” backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.\n\nMarket volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.\n\nIn Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that “there is a risk of disappointment.” The large bank expects that the Fed might stay ‘higher-for-longer,’ US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.\n\nWith this in mind, let us now have a look at 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Its chips are used in several end markets, such as high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems. The company accounts for over ~90% of the market share for GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s competitive moat remains powerful as it has been investing for more than a decade in software in such a way that allows its hardware to outperform regular silicon. This outperformance takes place as a result of software optimizations and acceleration libraries which are updated constantly.\n\nUndoubtedly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a strong economic moat, thanks to its intangible assets regarding its graphics processing units, and switching costs involved around its proprietary software, like the CUDA platform for AI tools. This lets developers use the company’s GPUs to build AI models. Just like iOS, which locks people into the iPhone since developers are making applications for the iPhone, market experts believe that this same thing is happening for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The AI engineers are learning the CUDA platform to program GPUs.\n\nThe company released its 2Q 2024 financial results, with record quarterly revenue of $30.0 billion, up by 15% from 1Q 2023 and up by 122% on a YoY basis. The company’s record revenues were supported by the fact that global data centers continue to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.\n\nRosenblatt Securities reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), giving a price target of $200.00 on 29th August.\n\nAoris Investment Management, a specialist international equity manager, released its Q2 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM): Among the Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years.\n\nGrowing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn’t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly.\n\nPricing Power Remains Critical, Says Legendary Investor\n\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn’t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.\n\nThe veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers.\n\nForecasts for 2024\n\nWall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched.\n\nMoving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points.\n\nEquity Market Outlook Amidst Uncertain Macro-Economic Environment\n\nA “higher-for-longer” backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.\n\nMarket volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.\n\nIn Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that “there is a risk of disappointment.” The large bank expects that the Fed might stay ‘higher-for-longer,’ US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 156\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest dedicated contract chip manufacturer, or foundry having more than 60% market share. The company makes integrated circuits for customers based on their proprietary IC designs.\n\nThe company enjoys a wide economic moat due to its technological leadership, scale, and reputation. Also, strong brand recognition and high barriers to entry further solidify its competitive advantages. Its economic moat also stems from the cost advantage and intangible assets, which are realized due to its leading position in process technology, or nodes.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) possesses an even larger market share (~90%) of advanced chip manufacturing. This includes 3-nanometer chips, which continue to gain popularity and are becoming standard, and advanced chip packaging for larger components.\n\nWell-renowned names, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) to make their chips. This is because no other company can provide its capacity or technological expertise.\n\nThe company’s leading position in advanced processes should help it attract and retain more customers, see more stable utilization of production capacities, and lower production costs. Therefore, over the next decade or so, it should generate sufficient profits to finance R&D and capital expenditures on subsequent nodes.\n\nNeedham & Company LLC upped its price target on the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) from $168.00 to $210.00. They gave a “Buy” rating on 15th July.\n\nAriel Investments, an investment management company, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also traded sharply higher in the quarter, following its annual shareholder meeting where management highlighted robust earnings visibility. The boom in AI investment is driving significant demand for the semiconductor hardware that enables it. TSMC currently holds a dominant position in relevant chip manufacturing and packaging. Additionally, although AI investments have been mostly focused on the datacenter market, Apple’s recent announcement on “Apple Intelligence” kickstarted an Edge AI race—which will likely drive greater than expected semiconductor growth in smartphones. TSMC is Apple’s sole foundry partner which bodes well for the future. Overall, we continue to view TSMC’s scale, technology, business model, customer service and execution favorably. The fact the company remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends is another plus.”\n\nOverall TSM ranks 4th on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

It breaks down a large system into smaller, manageable parts (elements) and analyzes them to understand how the entire system behaves under various conditions.\n\nAccording to the paper Optimizing Collaboration of LLM based Agents for Finite Element Analysis published by Chuan Tian and Yilei Zhang, this approach involves multiple AI agents working together to handle different tasks within the FEM process, such as programming and analyzing results. By optimizing the roles of these agents and allowing them to communicate effectively, the system can solve FEM problems more efficiently and accurately.\n\n6. AI in Recommendation Algorithms\n\nThompson Sampling (TS) is a popular algorithm used in the contextual bandit framework for making sequential decisions, such as which items to recommend to users. Contextual bandits are frameworks used for making sequential decisions in online recommendations, such as movie or news suggestions. Herding effects occur when users' feedback is influenced by previous users' ratings, leading to biased feedback. TS-Conf (Thompson Sampling under Conformity) is a variant of this TS that specifically accounts for the conformity or bias in user feedback caused by herding effects. TS-Conf, is an algorithm designed to mitigate the negative impacts of herding effects. The algorithm uses sampling to better balance exploration and exploitation, even when feedback is biased.\n\nAccording to the paper Contextual Bandit with Herding Effects: Algorithms and Recommendation Applications published by Luyue Xu, Liming Wang, Hong Xie, and Mingqiang Zhou TS-Conf can more effectively learn and improve recommendations over time, even in the presence of feedback biases. TS-Conf is a significant breakthrough in AI, particularly in the domain of online recommendation systems using contextual bandits.\n\n5.

A Leap Toward Brain-Like Computing\n\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that more closely mimic the way biological brains process information. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), which use continuous values for neuron activation, SNNs operate based on discrete events known as \"spikes.\" In an SNN, a neuron fires a spike when its membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, similar to how neurons in the brain communicate.\n\nAccording to the paper Sparsity-Aware Hardware-Software Co-Design of Spiking Neural Networks published by Ilkin Aliyev, Kama Svoboda, Tosiron Adegbija, and Jean-Marc Fellous, SNNs can encode information through the timing of spikes, which makes them proficient at recognizing patterns over time. This ability is valuable in applications such as speech recognition, audio processing, and the analysis of time-series data. Additionally, SNNs are well-suited for event-based sensing, allowing them to efficiently process data from vision and auditory systems in real-time as events happen, rather than at predetermined intervals. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and their hardware-software co-design represent a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\n3. Efficiency in Audio-Visual Video Classification\n\nAttend-Fusion is a compact model architecture designed to effectively capture relationships between audio and visual modalities in video data. The development of Attend-Fusion marks a significant breakthrough in AI for audio-visual (AV) video classification. Traditional AV video classification models often rely on large, complex architectures that, while effective, come with substantial computational demands. However, Attend-Fusion offers a compact model architecture designed to capture intricate relationships between audio and visual modalities with remarkable efficiency. Attend-Fusion can achieve a high F1 score of 75.64% with just 72 million parameters a model size almost 80% smaller than some larger counterparts, such as the Fully-Connected Late Fusion model, which uses 341 million parameters.\n\nAccording to the paper Attend-Fusion: Efficient Audio-Visual Fusion for Video Classification published by Mahrukh Awan, Asmar Nadeem, Junaid Awan, and others, this significant reduction in model size is achieved without compromising performance, due to the incorporation of advanced attention mechanisms. These mechanisms allow Attend-Fusion to focus on the most relevant parts of both audio and visual data, effectively capturing complex temporal and cross-modal relationships that are essential for accurate video classification.\n\n2. OpenAI's CLIP Model in 2024\n\nThe CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) model, developed by OpenAI, marks a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence in 2024. According to the paper Social Perception Of Faces In A Vision-Language Model published by Carina I. Hausladen, Manuel Knott, Colin F. Camerer, and Pietro Perona, CLIP transformer-based architecture, which powers both the vision and language components of the model. This design enables CLIP to perform a wide array of tasks that involve understanding and interpreting images in the context of natural language and can execute complex functions with remarkable versatility.\n\nCLIP can match images with corresponding textual descriptions and vice versa. This capability not only enhances image retrieval systems but also enables the model to perform zero-shot learning, a machine learning scenario in which an AI model is trained to recognize and categorize objects or concepts without having seen any examples of those categories or concepts beforehand.\n\n1. Generative AI for Videos\n\nThe paper Video Diffusion Models by Andrew Melnik, Michal Ljubljanac, Cong Lu, Qi Yan, Weiming Ren, and Helge Ritter examines different architectural choices for video diffusion norms and mechanisms for modeling temporal dynamics to enhance video quality. The authors discuss that diffusion models can revolutionize content creation and generate high-quality videos based on input, including text prompts, images, videos, and audio signals.\n\nThis sophisticated technology utilizes deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) unlike its image-focused counterpart, which generates static visuals, generative AI for videos produces dynamic and coherent sequences that simulate real motion and interaction. By analyzing extensive video datasets, GAN systems can learn to craft smooth, engaging videos that can mimic professional production styles, making it possible to create entirely new and immersive visual experiences. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force in technology, the rapid improvement in text-to-video technology represents a significant breakthrough in generative AI by expanding its capabilities from images to video production at a quality level that was previously unattainable.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Short Seller Sentiment Is Bullish",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other American tech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\n\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\n\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\n\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\n\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\n\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n% of shares shorted: 1.20%\n\nIndustry-leading parallel processing is provided by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs, which were formerly required for PC gaming applications but are now also needed for cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence, and possibly other applications.\n\nThe company's dominant position in the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the hardware and software tools required to support the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence business gives it a competitive advantage. Eventually, analysts predict that the largest tech companies will work to identify alternatives to NVDA or internal resources to broaden their AI offerings. However, these initiatives will probably erode rather than completely replace Nvidia's leadership in this field, as it is the leading AI chip vendor.\n\nThe American tech firm has recently released NIM Agent Blueprints, an AI workflow catalog that can be customized and used by enterprise developers to build and implement generative AI systems.\n\nNvidia revealed second-quarter 2025 earnings and a third-quarter outlook that exceeded FactSet consensus predictions, demonstrating that the company is still operating at full capacity. The unending demand for graphics processing units, or GPUs, and associated goods used in data centers to power artificial intelligence has kept Morningstar analysts optimistic about Nvidia. Nonetheless, the firm's earnings beat wasn't as spectacular as it has been in previous quarters, which is why the shares declined after hours.\n\nCiting solid Q2 2025 performance and ongoing high demand from significant areas like Hyperscalers, Enterprises, and Sovereign nations, Philip Woo of Phillip Securities reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a $155 target. Nvidia's dominance in AI GPUs and a promising outlook for 2025 and 2026 lend credence to his optimism.\n\nThe AI chip maker behemoth has hedge fund sentiments of 179 in Q2 2024. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company, with 2,501,400 shares worth $3.85 million.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 8th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\n\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\n\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\n\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\n\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $192 million\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the stock market's top stock when it comes to artificial intelligence. The firm's competitive moat is based on its GPU design, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s chips are widely perceived to be the best of breed in the industry. This has led to an insatiable demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs, so much so that it has made the firm's revenue grow from $16.7 billion in 2021 to $79.7 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. This marks a 377% growth on an absolute basis, and during the same time period, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares have appreciated by 299%, after having trimmed their gains since July. By July, the stock had appreciated by 339%, before NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shared its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Since its hypothesis depends solely on its GPUs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is vulnerable to any inventory disruptions or gluts since it has few alternatives to rely on for revenue. At the same time, its technological strength means that any GPU alternatives from other firms can be hard to come by, making the world continue to be dependent on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) for the best GPUs.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\n\nMoreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Nvidia, Super Micro, or Broadcom? Meet the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stock I Think Is the Best Buy and Hold Over the Next 10 Years.",
        "content": "It's no secret that semiconductor stocks have been particularly big winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. With share prices skyrocketing, several high-profile chip companies have opted for stock splits this year. Some AI chip stock-split stocks you might recognize include Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nIndeed, each of these stocks has done wonders for many portfolios over the last couple of years. However, I see one of these chip stocks as the superior choice over its peers.\n\nLet's break down the full picture at Nvidia, Supermicro, and Broadcom and determine which AI chip stock-split stock could be the best buy-and-hold opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFor the last two years, Nvidia has not only been the biggest name in the chip space but also essentially emerged as the ultimate gauge of AI demand at large. The company specializes in designing sophisticated chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and data center services. Moreover, Nvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) provides a software component that can used in conjunction with its GPUs, providing the company with an enviable and lucrative end-to-end AI ecosystem.\n\nWhile all that looks great, investors cannot afford to be starry-eyed due to Nvidia's existing dominance. The table below breaks down Nvidia's revenue and free-cash-flow growth trends over the last several quarters.\n\nCategory Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Revenue 101% 206% 265% 262% 122% Free cash flow 634% Not material 553% 473% 125%\n\nData source: Nvidia Investor Relations.\n\nAdmittedly, it's hard to throw shade on a company that is consistently delivering triple-digit revenue and profit growth. My concern with Nvidia is not related to the level of its growth but rather its pace.\n\nFor the company's second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28), Nvidia's revenue and free cash flow rose 122% and 125% year over year, respectively. This is a notable slowdown from the last several quarters. It's fair to point out that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and a factor like that could influence growth in any given quarter. Unfortunately, I think there's more beneath the surface with Nvidia.\n\nNamely, Nvidia faces rising competition from direct industry forces, such as Advanced Micro Devices, and tangential threats from its customers -- namely, Tesla, Meta, and Amazon. In theory, as competition in the chip space rises, customers will have more options.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis leaves Nvidia with less leverage, which will likely diminish some of its pricing power. In the long run, this could take a hefty toll on Nvidia's revenue and profit growth. For these reasons, investors might want to consider some alternatives to Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro is an IT architecture company specializing in designing server racks and other infrastructure for data centers. In recent years, soaring demand for semiconductor chips and data center services has served as a bellwether for Supermicro. Moreover, the company's close alliance with Nvidia has proved particularly beneficial.\n\nThat said, I have some concerns with Supermicro. As an infrastructure business, the company relies heavily on other companies' capital expenditure needs. This makes Supermicro's growth susceptible to external variables, such as demand for data center services, chips, server racks, and more. Furthermore, Supermicro is far from the only IT architecture specialist in the market.\n\nCompetition from Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Lenovo (just to name a few) bring their own levels of expertise to the marketplace. As a result of competing in such a commoditized atmosphere, Supermicro can be forced to compete on price -- which takes a toll on profit generation.\n\nInfrastructure businesses do not carry the same margin profile as software companies, for instance. Given that the company's gross margins are fairly low and in decline, investors must be cautious. While Supermicro's management tried to assure investors that the margin deterioration is the result of some logjams in the supply chain, more recent news might signal that gross margin is the least of the company's concerns. SMCI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSupermicro was recently the target of a short report published by Hindenburg Research. Hindenburg alleges that Supermicro's accounting practices have some flaws. Following the short report, Supermicro responded in a press release outlining that the company is delaying its annual filing for fiscal year 2024.\n\nGiven the unpredictability of demand prospects, a fluctuating margin and profit dynamic, and the allegations surrounding its accounting practices, I think investors now have better options in the chip space.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBy process of elimination, it's clear that Broadcom is my top buy-and-hold choice among chip stocks right now. This is not because Broadcom's returns this year have lagged its counterparts, though. The underlying reasons Broadcom's shares have paled compared to other chip stocks could shine some light on why I think its best days are ahead.\n\nI see Broadcom as a more diversified business than Nvidia and Supermicro. The company operates across a host of growth markets, including semiconductors and infrastructure software. Grand View Research estimates that the total addressable market for systems infrastructure in the U.S. was valued at $136 billion back in 2021 and was set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% between 2022 and 2030.\n\nSystems infrastructure comprises opportunities in data centers, communications, cloud computing, and more. Considering corporations of all sizes are increasingly relying on digital infrastructure to make data-driven decisions, I see the role Broadcom plays in network security and connectivity as a major opportunity and think its recent acquisition of VMware is particularly savvy and will help unlock new growth potential. AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIf you look at the growth trends in the chart above, it's obvious that Broadcom is not experiencing the same level of demand as Nvidia and Supermicro right now. I think this is because Broadcom's position in the broader AI realm is yet to experience commensurate growth compared to buying chips and storage solutions in droves.\n\nWhile I'm not saying Nvidia or Supermicro are poor choices, I think their futures look cloudier than Broadcom's right now. I believe Broadcom is in the very early stages of a new growth frontier featuring many different themes (with AI being just one of them). For these reasons, I see Broadcom as the best option explored in this piece and think long-term investors have a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares and hold on tight.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer’s Latest Comments on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "content": "In this article, we’ll share Jim Cramer's latest comments about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). First, we will take a look Cramer's analysis of the market sentiment.\n\nFriday Madness\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer described September 6, Friday, as a dismal trading day following a critical non-farm payrolls report. Bulls hoped for weaker-than-expected hiring and steady wages to prompt the Federal Reserve to consider cutting rates. They got what they wished for, but this led to a surprising turn of events: instead of rallying, the market saw a sharp decline, with the Dow falling 410 points, the S&P dropping 1.73%, and the NASDAQ plummeting 2.55%.\n\n\"What an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we’d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that’s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.\n\nThe Dow fell 410 points, the S&P plunged 1.73%, and the NASDAQ plummeted 2.55%. This market has a September problem. Come September, we’re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it’s the weakest month of the year. I know that’s somewhat circular reasoning—we sell because we’ve always sold—but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you're worried about a more severe slowdown.\"\n\nCramer noted that September often brings significant profit-taking, making it historically the weakest month for the market. While this might seem like circular reasoning, it's more plausible than suggesting that fear of a severe economic slowdown drives the sell-off. In fact, big tech companies, which are central to ongoing powerful trends like data centers and accelerated computing, should be seen as buying opportunities during market dips.\n\n\"This market has a September problem. Come September, we’re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it’s the weakest month of the year. I know that’s somewhat circular reasoning—we sell because we’ve always sold—but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you're worried about a more severe slowdown.\n\nWhy? Well, because big tech is all about powerful secular themes that can keep going even during a recession—and we're not getting one. I’m talking about the data center, accelerated computing—they're not going anywhere. Nevertheless, when anything jars the big tech themes of the moment, the market’s reaction is swift, harsh, and horrible.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer discussed the aftermath of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s recent report, noting that despite his belief that AI is not a bubble, the stocks related to AI have seen substantial gains, particularly in August. He pointed out that September often triggers increased selling, even when companies report results that meet expectations.\n\n\"Look at what happened after the company reported last night. I don’t believe AI is a bubble, but these stocks are still up a great deal, especially in August. And September tends to bring out sellers when you get just in-line numbers.\"\n\nThe Upcoming Debate Between Harris and Trump\n\nJim Cramer also commented on the upcoming debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump, scheduled for Tuesday night. He questioned how much the economy will be a focus, speculating that Trump might try to link Harris to recent inflation trends, while Harris may present herself as a more moderate alternative to President Biden.\n\n\"Tuesday night’s the great debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump. I don’t know how much of a role the economy will play in the debate. If Trump’s on his game, he’ll try to tie Harris to the inflation we’ve experienced since COVID. I suspect that Harris will try to portray herself as more moderate than President Biden. Either way, I doubt there’ll be anything specifically market-moving, even if the candidates say something newsworthy about their tax plans. Keep in mind that the winner in November likely won’t have the Senate votes to totally rework the tax code, whether we’re talking about Harris’s capital gains tax or Trump’s 19th-century-style tariffs.\"\n\nJim Cramer Urges Investors: \"Please Do Not Give Up the Ship Here\"\n\nThen he discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will provide another update on inflation. He emphasized that if inflation remains steady or decreases, the Federal Reserve will have more flexibility to lower interest rates and potentially avoid a recession, addressing concerns from many sellers. Cramer urged investors to stay confident and not to abandon their positions based on these uncertainties.\n\n\"Wednesday, we get another read on inflation—this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession—the thing so many sellers are worried about. That’s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.\"\n\nJim Cramer's Recent NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Comments:\n\nA week ago on Friday Cramer urged his viewers not to dwell on the day-to-day movements of NVDA stock:\n\n\" When you look at NVIDIA on forward earnings or estimates, it always looks expensive, and then it so far trumps those estimates that when you look backward, it turns out the stock was selling at a remarkably low price. That's been the secret to NVIDIA literally since 2012—incredible! It just keeps doing that, right? Please don’t put too much significance on day-to-day gyrations in a stock's share price. You have to know when something is a signal and when it’s all just sound and noise, always signifying nothing.\"\n\nCramer shared a similar sentiment on Wednesday as well:\n\n\"What about tech weakness as a recession signal? I keep hearing Nvidia may have missed its quarter due to economic softness. Let’s put that rumor to bed. The issue wasn’t demand; it was Nvidia’s inability to produce enough of its high-end Blackwell chips due to supply constraints. This wasn’t a demand issue.\n\nNow, let's address the overblown narrative surrounding Nvidia's stock drop, which wiped out $279 billion in market capitalization. In isolation, that sounds terrifying, but keep this in perspective: Nvidia started the year with a $1.22 trillion market cap and soared to $2.93 trillion by the end of August. Yesterday’s drop to $2.65 trillion? Sure, it’s a big number, but in the context of a stock that’s up over 100% this year, it’s not as catastrophic as it seems.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time Nvidia’s market cap has dropped over $200 billion in a day, and it likely won’t be the last. Yet, I know what you're thinking—Nvidia’s stock is on fragile ground. That’s fair. There are still far too many investors who don’t understand what Nvidia does or how it profits from the brainpower of CEO Jensen Huang and his team.\n\nThe stock can’t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. Meanwhile, we’re waiting to see how quickly Nvidia can get its Blackwell chip rolling and improve gross margins—the real reason for the stock's recent pummeling.\"\n\nNVDA is ranked 6th on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 179 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the second quarter which was 186 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Opinion: Nvidia's $50 Billion Buyback Is Not a Reason to Buy the Stock Hand Over Fist. Here's What I'm Concerned About.",
        "content": "On Aug. 28, Wall Street held its breath as the world's most important artificial intelligence (AI) company reported second-quarter earnings. I'm talking about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), of course. While each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is seen as an indicator for the direction of all things AI, Nvidia has emerged as perhaps the industry's end-all-be-all barometer.\n\nBut fear not! Once again, Nvidia silenced the doubters after posting yet another spectacular earnings report. However, while combing through the financial and operating metrics, I discovered one announcement that left me a little perplexed.\n\nNamely, Nvidia's board of directors approved an additional $50 billion in share repurchases (this comes on top of a remaining $7.5 billion from a prior buyback program). There's a general notion that stock buybacks can be quite favorable for investors. But in the case of Nvidia, I just don't get it.\n\nBelow, I'll break down some reasons why I think Nvidia announced the buyback and why I do not see this move as a reason to buy the stock right now.\n\nIs Nvidia's buyback a distraction?\n\nOne of the bigger announcements from Nvidia this year was the company's 10-for-1 stock split, which occurred back in June. Since early September 2022, shares of Nvidia have risen over 750%. As the stock price eclipsed $1,000 per share, building a position in Nvidia became more of a hurdle for some investors.\n\nSometimes, a company will choose to split its stock following these significant rises in the share price. Although a stock split does not inherently change a company's market capitalization, the lower split-adjusted price is often perceived as less expensive and may inspire investors to buy. As a result, a stock could actually become more expensive following a split as a larger body of investors starts to pour in.\n\nThis isn't exactly the case with Nvidia stock, though. Since shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10, Nvidia stock has declined by about 2% (as of market close on Sept. 2). I'll concede that a 2% drop is not a reason to panic. But with that said, I am a little surprised that the split did not inspire a noticeable uptick in buying activity and subsequently propel Nvidia's valuation to new highs.\n\nTo be candid, I see the announcement of the buyback as somewhat of a PR stunt and an effort to reinspire investors. Image source: Getty Images\n\nDoes Nvidia's buyback make strategic sense?\n\nImagine watching a commercial in which a celebrity you admire endorses a product, but later, you learn that the celebrity has never used the product and simply promoted it because they were paid a fee to do so. In a way, that's sort of what's going on with Nvidia right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile adding to the existing buyback initiative might give the impression that management views the stock as a good buying opportunity or even undervalued, keep in mind that insider selling has become all the rage at Nvidia over the last couple of months. Executives, including Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang; executive vice president of operations, Debora Shoquist; and board members Mark Stevens and Tench Coxe were all selling stock when Nvidia shares were riding high earlier in the summer.\n\nWhy should you buy Nvidia stock when those responsible for generating shareholder value are cashing out? Perhaps this is a harsh criticism, as Nvidia's executives still own large chunks of stock -- making their net worth closely tied to the performance of the business. Nevertheless, I have some other concerns regarding the buyback.\n\nWhile Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), not too long ago, I wrote a piece on how the company is deploying its record profits into growth initiatives outside its core semiconductor and data center businesses. Moreover, considering Nvidia's closest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), has made several notable acquisitions over just the last couple of years, I would think management would be motivated to double down on research and development, marketing, and other endeavors amid intensifying competition. I would see those as more prudent decisions, considering Nvidia did have to delay orders on its newest Blackwell GPUs due to a design flaw.\n\nOne last point I'd like to make pertains to competition outside of AMD. Nvidia is also facing surging competition from its own customers -- particularly some of the Magnificent Seven members. Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla relies heavily on Nvidia chips to develop autonomous driving software. But recent remarks from Elon Musk suggest Tesla is looking to migrate away from Nvidia and perhaps compete with the chip giant in the future. Moreover, both Amazon and Meta are increasing investments in capital expenditures (capex), specifically in some projects revolving around designing their own in-house semiconductor chips.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a good buy right now?\n\nIf you look at Nvidia purely from a valuation perspective, there's an argument to be made that the stock is a bargain right now. On price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) bases, Nvidia stock is actually less expensive today than it was even just a few years ago -- and that's with all of this newfound revenue and profit growth. NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nBut I'm beginning to have some concerns that Nvidia is hard-pressed to identify opportunities to allocate capital amid a period of rising competition. I'm not going to put forth the notion that investing in Nvidia is a disastrous choice. I'll save the doomsday-speak for another time.\n\nHowever, investors should realize that Nvidia's record growth across the top and bottom lines will not last forever. Eventually, growth will normalize and take a toll on Nvidia's profits. For that reason, I find the $50 billion buyback questionable and not reason alone to scoop up shares of Nvidia at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "It's hard to beat the growth potential of cryptocurrencies. Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood, for instance, believes that Bitcoin has more than 2,000% in long-term upside. But some stocks have just as much room for growth. If you're looking for maximum upside, these two stocks are for you.\n\nThis AI stock has been a rocket\n\nNo list of stocks with massive upside would be complete without a mention of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Few investments have ever risen as quickly as the chipmaker. A $1,000 investment made five years ago would already be worth more than $26,000. Yet Wall Street analysts still believe there's more than 30% in gains to come in the next 12 months. Given that Nvidia's market cap is now around $2.6 trillion, it can be hard to picture how it would deliver further huge gains in the near term. But there are several reasons for optimism. NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nThe same catalyst that has sent Nvidia stock soaring will not only be in place for the next several decades, but should strengthen significantly over time. In many ways, the story of Nvidia is still very much in its early innings. That's because the company's biggest source of growth is the rapid rise of AI technologies that rely on its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) to function.\n\nGone are the days when Nvidia's financial situation was dictated by gaming and small use cases. Today, there's an arms race for the components that enable AI research and innovation -- and Nvidia's got the goods everyone wants.\n\nAccording to estimates from BIS Research, the AI industry's spending on semiconductors totaled around $15 billion last year. But spending has already picked up dramatically in 2024, providing a tailwind that has more than doubled Nvidia's revenues over the past 12 months.\n\nBIS Research expects that spending to increase by nearly 32% over the next several years, with plenty more growth expected beyond that. Nvidia has an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs, positioning it to capture the lion's share of this long-term growth trend. Nvidia should also directly benefit from the rise of crypto, as it specifically designs many of its GPUs for cryptocurrency mining.\n\nWhat's the one category that could outpace the entire value of the crypto industry? AI. And in that arena, Nvidia is the stock to bet on.\n\nDiversify your portfolio with this fintech\n\nNvidia's market cap will likely prevent it from rising by another 1,000% anytime soon. But there's one fintech stock that has the potential to do so: Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU).\n\nMost investors have never heard of Nu, even though it has a market cap of nearly $70 billion. That's because the bank operates exclusively in Latin America, and the only way to access its services is via smartphones. Its strategy upended Latin America's banking industry a decade ago. Instead of building and operating costly physical branches, Nu offered its services directly to consumers online. This lowered costs, allowing it to compete aggressively on price and offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, it allows Nu to innovate faster than the competition. When the company launched its Nu Cripto platform -- a service that allows people to buy, sell, and transact in various cryptocurrencies -- it attained 1 million users in a matter of months. Innovations like this help explain how Nu has gone from essentially zero customers a decade ago to more than 100 million today.\n\nBut Nu is far from done growing. There are more than 650 million people in Latin America, and Nu has proven its ability to penetrate markets quickly. More than half of all Brazilian adults are now Nu customers, and Nu has been replicating its playbook in new markets like Mexico and Colombia.\n\nAnalysts expect sales growth to be around 44% this year, followed by another 30% in 2025, and there's a good chance that Nu will maintain double-digit percentage growth rates through the next decade and beyond. This is a long-term story, but Nu has the potential to match or exceed the performance of most major cryptocurrencies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Risk-On Momentum in Stocks Succumbs to Mounting Growth Worries",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The seemingly unstoppable stock market rally is wobbling as it confronts a horde of challenges to the momentum that’s taken it from record high to record high.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus Rome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris\n\nA rout early last month was a glimpse of how quickly things can turn bad, a sharp selloff driven by US recession fears that rocked investors used to going in only one direction. While the S&P 500 subsequently rebounded, crucially it didn’t made back all the ground lost.\n\nThen, US data Friday showing weaker payrolls growth reinforced the view that the labor market is cooling and sent stocks reeling. The S&P 500 fell 4.25% last week, while the Nasdaq 100 lost the most since November 2022.\n\nWorries about the US are just one of the cracks. There’s also concern about growth in China and Germany, and the implications of that weakness on earnings and prices. That’s making the way forward look more volatile, even as the foggy rate path clears up and investors count down the days to the first Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in four years.\n\nThen there’s the US election, turbulence in European politics and the concentration of money in mega-cap tech stocks, all risks that could hurt the bullish sentiment that at times has looked utterly unshakable.\n\nFrothy valuations have also created new vulnerabilities. Many had to chase the rally and bought at expensive levels, meaning they may sell quickly if things start to reverse, and the market could fall harder and deeper before the usual dip buying kicks in. Additionally, the shift in options trading and the forces of systematic investors are capable of triggering erratic moves and potential avalanches of de-risking.\n\n“It wasn’t too long ago that markets were one directional and everyone piling into the same set of stocks,” said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “That’s no longer the case and stocks are unlikely to repeat this relentless rally.”\n\nNew Targets\n\nEven after the August hiccup, the S&P 500 is still up 13% this year, and the MSCI World Index has risen 10%.\n\nA strong start to the year left strategists at UBS Group AG, RBC Capital Markets LLC and elsewhere scrambling to revise year-end targets made just a few weeks earlier.\n\nBut the view now appears to be that the best days may have passed. The average of 20 strategists tracked by Bloomberg implies gains of only 1% more for the S&P until the end of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the market has been here before. Multiple shocks in recent years have taken a swipe at the equity juggernaut.\n\nBut whether it was the collapse of banks in the US and Switzerland, or geopolitical tensions such as the escalation of violence in the Middle East, the market reaction proved to be temporary. Equities quickly bounced back and powered on to new highs.\n\nThe biggest setback was 2022, an $18 trillion global selloff sparked by inflation and the Fed’s actions to turn off the monetary spigot. But as price pressures cooled, investors bet that the central bank would ease again. That optimism carried the S&P 500 to a 2023 recovery and then multiple records this year — 38 and counting.\n\nTech Concentration\n\nIf there’s one stock that sums up this year’s rally, it’s Nvidia Corp. A symbol of the concentration of cash in US big tech, it’s more than doubled in 2024. But the high dependency and clustered positioning, which leans heavily on artificial intelligence being a productivity game changer, is worrying.\n\nNvidia has been the single biggest driver of global equities this year, contributing nearly a fifth of the Bloomberg World Index’s 10% advance. And it’s become something of a bellwether of broader sentiment. A rout in the stock early last week also spread to risk assets, signifying just how high the stakes are if it disappoints.\n\n“Everybody loves tech stocks because they generate quite a bit of free cash flow, but they forget about the second part of that equation, which is how much are you paying for that,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “AI is real. I think those companies are probably good companies, but are they good stocks? That’s what we’re going to find out.”\n\nOther risks from investor positioning arise from approaches such as so-called trend followers or volatility controlled funds as well as the options market, increasingly dominated but very short-term trading. Trading flows from those investors can reinforce intraday swings, seen recently during the early August slump.\n\nSince August, economic growth has taken center stage, with investors fearing that the US is heading into trouble and the central bank may have waited too long to cut.\n\nOn Friday, traders reacted to the payrolls data by increasing bets on a 50 basis-point Fed cut this month. But a reduction doesn’t guarantee that stocks will rally again given that any easing will be a response to slowing activity. If it’s accompanied by a more downbeat economic assessment, that could be a catalyst for further selling.\n\nIn Europe, the fretting is focused on Germany, even more so after news that carmaker Volkswagen AG may shut plants there, adding to questions about the future of its industry. It’s also facing increased political uncertainty ahead of national elections next year.\n\nMeanwhile, demand weakness in China — a key market for makers of luxury goods, cars and machinery – is hitting earnings.\n\nThe world’s second-biggest economy has struggled with a weak post-Covid recovery, and a prolonged property downturn has crimped consumer spending. In a sign of growing pessimism, JPMorgan Chase & Co. this month dropped its buy recommendation for Chinese stocks, citing risks around the US presidential election and the threat of new tariffs.\n\nPolls show a tight race between candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Last week, the latter made an appeal to business with a pledge to cut corporate taxes to 15%, a move that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists estimate would raise S&P 500 earnings by about 4%. Harris, in contrast, has proposed raising the corporate rate as well as capital gains levies on high earners.\n\n“The possibility that the result of the US elections could be contested is adding a layer of uncertainty,” said Frederique Carrier, head of investment strategy at RBC Wealth Management. “I expect market sentiment to be more fragile into the year end, and stick with our preference for high quality companies.”\n\nActive managers such as hedge funds could keep selling US stocks ahead of the Nov. 5 vote. Typically, they sell ahead of such events to have more cash ready for any volatility or big swings.\n\nBut this time, despite a few months of consistent offloading, their exposure is elevated compared with the last six election cycles, Goldman Sachs data show. That indicates there’s more room to unwind positions.\n\n“The biggest risk to US markets is that the economy is shifting from an expansion – which it has been in since April 2020 – into deceleration or possibly a recession,” said Jens Foehrenbach, head of Public Markets within Discretionary at Man Group. “Valuations are somewhat inflated and don’t incorporate a hard landing. Therefore, any negative surprise can trigger an outsized market reaction.”\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika, Elena Popina, Sujata Rao, Abhishek Vishnoi and Lu Wang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nEach week is full of surprises when you are involved in media.\n\nI guess that's part of the adrenaline-inducing rush of being in the game, so to speak.\n\nTo that end, I was personally surprised by two things this week.\n\nOne, not everyone 30 years old and under has heard of Compaq.\n\nAs a brief refresher, they made large desktop computers that once connected to a phone jack that connected to the wall that connected to this thing called the World Wide Web (or internet...).\n\nOnce all plugged in, you turned on the Compaq (the most popular model was the Compaq Presario) via a switch in the back, logged into something called an AOL (America Online) account, listened to loud techy noises come from the computer, and poof, you were magically connected to friends you just saw in school and complete strangers in faraway lands.\n\nYou then got to posting sad songs on your MySpace account because, chances are, you just broke up with your high school sweetheart for the ninth time in a week (or was that just me...).\n\nHewlett Packard, now split into PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) and AI server play Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought its rival Compaq for about $19 billion in a 2002 deal. (Also check out my recent chat with the CEO of HP and another chat with the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.)\n\nHP went on to discontinue the Compaq brand in 2013.\n\nThat part of the history lesson done. Compaq Computers Corp. then President Rod Canion poses with some of the products that put the company on the fast track, in Houston, Texas, July 27, 1988. (AP Photo/Gayland Wampler) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe next surprise for me this week is that not everyone under the age of 30 years old remembers the iconic \"Dude, you are getting a Dell\" TV commercials. These commercials dominated the airwaves when I was in college, and I would argue they put Dell on the map with consumers that barely knew how to use a computer.\n\nI have no idea why the commercials left an impression, but they did.\n\nAll in all, these reminded me that I was now moving closer to being a grey-beard at work. I have no actual beard; it just means you are this elder statesman. Weird to be in that place, but you can't outrun Father Time — even my bionic self. I envy the youth.\n\nHaving laid that all out, I actually have a surprise for YOU! That is, did you really know that Dell has totally transformed itself? Just read the company's annual report here and keep scrolling below.\n\nDell was founded in 1984 by then-University of Texas student Michael Dell. It made PCs, a lot of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough the years, the company has morphed into part PC maker, part tech player integral to the fabric of the world's tech infrastructure. Think servers, storage, and other components for entire countries and companies that I won't bore you listing.\n\nThe company is well beyond integrating its behemoth 2016 acquisition of EMC.\n\nI got to spend 25 minutes with Michael Dell this week in NYC at the Citi TMT conference (video above) and was really blown away by what the company is working on. Was I surprised, full-stop? No, because I still read all of the company's earnings reports and earnings call transcripts. But I was a little surprised to hear how deep the transformation runs at Dell.\n\nOn Friday, S&P Global announced that Dell will join the S&P 500, replacing Etsy, on Sept. 23. The move boosted its shares in extended trading, as the company will soon be in index funds that track the S&P 500. Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, is speaking at the ''New Strategies for a New Era'' keynote at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 27, 2024. (Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIt's embarking on its latest transformation for the age of AI. Dell said it secured $3.1 billion of AI server sales in the second quarter, almost double the $1.7 billion netted in the preceding quarter.\n\nSales in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group surged 38% to $11.65 billion. AI sales are captured in this segment.\n\nDell's Client Solutions Group — which includes sales of PCs and laptops — did see sales drop 4% to $12.41 billion. Consumer sales declined 22% to $1.86 billion, while the commercial business was flat at $10.6 billion.\n\nDell tells me the AI PC uptake has been pushed out a bit, but he has 200 million-plus Dell computers (aka the installed base). They will need the AI-powered replacements, and that cash will soon start rolling in.\n\n\"What organizations are seeing is this is a historic opportunity to make their businesses way more productive and efficient [with AI], while, at the same time, kind of reimagining them given all this capability,\" Dell told me.\n\nAnother surprise — at least to me — is how cheap the company is being valued at by the market.\n\nShares of Dell trade on a 13.5x forward PE multiple, according to Yahoo Finance data, well below the S&P 500's 22.5x. I am not saying the company should be valued on par with Nvidia (NVDA) or even a Salesforce (CRM). But assign Dell a reasonable 15x PE multiple on a reasonable $9.40 a share profit estimate for fiscal 2026 (which would represent about 20% earnings growth), and you have a $141 stock.\n\nDell's stock currently trades at $107.\n\nHead-scratching for a company clearly playing a key role in the AI future. Maybe it's a function of its PC exposure.\n\nBefore I venture off to begin shopping for an AI PC, I'd like to note I will be live on Yahoo Finance Monday and Tuesday from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference at the Palace hotel in San Francisco. This is one of my favorite conferences to cover each year, and we have a ton of big ticker-moving interviews lined up.

        "title": "Inflation back in focus, Apple's iPhone event: What to know this week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 just suffered its worst week since the 2023 regional banking scare as a mixed August jobs report failed to reinvigorate investor appetite.\n\nIn the holiday-shortened trading week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 4% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled nearly 6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped almost 3%. The first week of September also marked the worst weekly return for the Nasdaq 100 since 2022, led by a more than 12% decline in Nvidia stock (NVDA).\n\nA fresh reading on inflation will headline the week ahead as investors continue to look for clues on how deeply the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. Additionally, the first reading of consumer sentiment for September is slated for release on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, Apple's annual iPhone event kicks off the week on Monday. Earnings results from Oracle (ORCL), Adobe (ADBE), and Kroger (KR) will lead an otherwise quiet week in scheduled company announcements.\n\n'No clear winner' from the jobs report\n\nThe August jobs report showed the US economy added 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% from 4.3% in July. Revisions to the June and July labor reports showed the US economy added 86,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in those months.\n\nCapital Economics deputy chief North America economist Stephen Brown wrote in a note to clients Friday that given the report wasn't overly strong or exceedingly weak, it \"did not signal a clear winner\" in the debate over whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\nSpeeches from Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed president John Williams appeared to tilt the markets in favor of a 25 basis point cut.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 25% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point cut in September, down from a 40% chance seen the day prior, per the CME Fed Watch tool.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs economics team led by Jan Hatzius reasoned Friday's Fed speak was consistent with Goldman's forecast for a 25 basis point cut in September but indicates \"that the Fed leadership is open to 50bp cuts at subsequent meetings if the labor market continues to deteriorate.\"\n\nPrice check\n\nWhile signs of slowing in the labor market have been top of mind for market participants over the past few weeks, inflation remains a key piece of when and how aggressively the Fed will cut rates. Wednesday will bring the final inflation reading before the Fed's next policy decision on Sep. 18 with the release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects an annual gain of 2.6% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, down from the 2.9% seen in July. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, in line with their monthly increase from July.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.2% year over year, unchanged from the prior month. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%, also unchanged from the prior month.\n\n\"Another benign CPI report could give enough FOMC members further 'confidence' that inflation is moving back to 2% on a sustainable basis for them to back a 50 bps rate cut,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"If, on the other hand, the inflation data are hotter than expected, then the consensus likely will coalesce around a 25 bps reduction on Sept. 18.\"\n\niPhone intro\n\nThe top company release of the week will come on Monday when Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone event. The event is expected to provide more details on Apple's Apple Intelligence AI platform.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has the full preview.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\n'Uninspiring' earnings expectations\n\nAnalysts slashed their earnings expectations for the current quarter by 2.8% during July and August, per FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. As Butters pointed out in a note on Friday afternoon, analysts typically cut their earnings estimates as the quarter goes on.The current level isn't out of the ordinary, though. Analysts have slashed expectations by 3% on average for the past 20 years.\n\nBut still, it marks a shift in market sentiment compared to last quarter when analysts actually raised their estimates through the first two months of the quarter.\n\n\"Outside of the Magnificent 7, estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 [earnings per share] have been uninspiring, but at least stable,\" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nWhile not an alarming trend to macro strategists like Chronert just yet, the slight hit to what's otherwise been a solid fundamental case for stocks over the next year will be one to watch ahead of third quarter earnings season.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, August (2.97% previously); Wholesale inventories, July final (0.3% expected, 0.3% previously)\n\nEarnings: Oracle (ORCL), Rubrik (RBRK)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, August (93.7 expected, 93.7 previously)\n\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), GameStop (GME), Petco (WOOF)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); CPI, year-over-year, August (+2.6% expected, +2.9% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, August (+3.2% expected, +3.2% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+0.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Manchester United (MANU), Vera Bradley (VRA)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending Sept. 7 (230,000 expected, 233,00 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, August (+0.2% expected, +0.1% previously); PPI, year-over-year, August (+0.2% expected, 0% previously)\n\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Big Lots (BIG), Kroger (KR), RH (RH)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Import price index, month-over-month, August (-0.3% expected, +0.1% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, September preliminary (68.0 expected, 67.9 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Loses $470 Billion in Value in a Week. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry doesn't have quite the sheen as it did earlier this summer. Investors have become increasingly wary of the technology's ability to deliver real-world value -- at least in a time frame that justifies the sky-high stock valuations investors have seen.\n\nAt the heart of this lies the technology's posterchild, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's stock is down about 15% since it reported second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28. That's nearly half-a-trillion dollars -- $470 billion -- in market capitalization wiped out in a week. It's an incredible amount. There are only 15 companies on the planet with a market cap that exceeds what the company lost in a week. That shows just how big Nvidia is.\n\nThat kind of drop may make you nervous. It makes me nervous. Before you jump ship, however, let's consider some more context.\n\nThe market as a whole is shaky\n\nMost companies in the AI space are getting hammered. It's not just AI though; the whole market is down. There are a lot of factors at play. For starters, investors are looking to see more data -- like a new jobs report -- that will help indicate the direction the economy is headed. Tied to this will be the Fed's decision in the coming weeks on whether to cut rates and, critically, by how much. So Nvidia's slide comes as the market as a whole is down; the company is not alone.\n\nAnother likely factor to consider is that many investors are simply taking a profit. Some were likely waiting to see if the company's Q2 report would blow expectations out of the water once again. Although in many ways it did exceed expectations, it wasn't enough to send the stock flying, and it didn't indicate what might be just around the corner. These investors are choosing to realize the incredible returns they've seen over the past few years given they don't believe the stock is going to jump anytime soon.\n\nNvidia remains in an extremely solid position\n\nWhatever the reason Nvidia's stock dropped, it's not that important in the long run. This is a distraction.  Do you still believe in Nvidia's long-term prospects? I do.\n\nIn the medium term, there is ample reason to see growth continue. It might not hit the levels it has in recent quarters, more than tripling revenue year over year , but high double-digit growth is nothing to shake a stick at. Fears over revenue streams drying up, at least anytime soon, are overblown. If you look at the giant tech companies that buy Nvidia's chips, like Meta and Alphabet, their latest-earnings calls show a clear intent to not just continue but to expand spending on AI infrastructure. The gravy train isn't slowing any time soon.\n\nStory continues GOOG Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart\n\nLook at the massive increase in capital expenditures from Alphabet over the last three years. Notice the sharp upswing in the last year?\n\nThinking more long term now, the value proposition for Nvidia remains. AI is likely to transform the economy, and Nvidia is firmly placed in the middle of this transformation. Of course, Nividia is beset on all sides by competitors vying for that place, and the company will have to work diligently to stay ahead of the curve. But for my money, if there is a company that can do it, it is Nvidia. It has shown incredible foresight and an ability to innovate and pivot when it sees new opportunities.\n\nI think investors are likely to see more concrete examples of AI's impact on companies' bottom lines in the next year, and I believe it will renew investors' faith in AI as a whole and Nvidia as its champion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $630,099!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Best Stock-Split Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Stock splits don't change the value of a company, but they do often indicate that management expects the business will continue to perform well. And that solid operational performance can lead to wealth-building gains for shareholders.\n\nIf you have $1,000 or more to invest that you don't need for everyday living expenses or to pay down debt, you have come to the right place. Read on to learn about two high-quality businesses that have recently split their stock. Both are set to deliver handsome rewards to their investors.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 1: Walmart\n\nInflation might be moderating, but the sharp rise in the price of food, shelter, and other essentials in recent years has many people searching for discounts wherever they can. In an increasingly high-cost world, Walmart(NYSE: WMT), with its prices, has become an oasis for these bargain-hunting consumers.\n\nA vast selection of low-cost groceries and other household necessities is enabling Walmart's stores to generate strong sales even as shoppers pull back on nonessentials. This is one reason it has outperformed Target and other competitors that rely more on discretionary sales. WMT Total Return Price Chart\n\nThe retailer's online sales are also growing briskly. Booming demand for curbside pickup and delivery services fueled a 21% surge in Walmart's e-commerce revenue in its most recent quarter.\n\nAn expanding army of third-party merchants further lifted sales on the company's online marketplaces. These sellers are also driving the expansion of Walmart's lucrative advertising business, which saw sales rise by 26%.\n\nBetter still, its investments in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are boosting profits. The company's operating income climbed by more than 8% to $8 billion on a 5% increase in revenue to $169 billion.\n\nWalmart, in turn, chose to reward its shareholders with a 3-for-1 stock split in February. With its value-focused strategy clearly resonating with consumers, investors can expect the retail leader to continue to deliver strong returns.\n\nStock-split stock to buy No. 2: Nvidia\n\nWhile Walmart is saving people money, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is helping its customers create game-changing innovations. The semiconductor leader's chip designs lie at the heart of the AI revolution.\n\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft and Alphabet are ramping up their spending on AI infrastructure. Nvidia's chips are the best on the market, so it's a huge beneficiary of this powerful trend. The chipmaker's revenue leaped by 122% year over year to $30 billion in its most recent quarter. Net profits rose by an even more impressive 168% to $16.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the party is just getting started. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimates that $1 trillion worth of data center equipment will need to be upgraded to new accelerated computing infrastructure to meet the torrid demand for AI. As the leading provider of AI chip designs, his company stands to profit from this massive spending more than any other company.\n\nWith its business firing on all cylinders, Nvidia dazzled investors with a 10-for-1 stock split in June. Wall Street analysts see plenty of upside remaining. For one, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann believes the stock is headed to $200 per share, fueled by strong sales of its forthcoming Blackwell chips. That would represent gains of more than 85% for investors who buy shares today.\n\nMoreover, if you invest in Nvidia's stock now, you'll likely be buying alongside its management. The board of directors boosted its share repurchase program by $50 billion on Aug. 26.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Replace Intel in the Dow Jones Index",
        "content": "It's no secret that Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been struggling. The stock is down more than 60% year to date and has been the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year.\n\nThe company was once the largest chipmaker in the world, dominating the personal computer (PC) space. That helped it become one of the first two technology companies to join the famed Dow Jones index, along with Microsoft back in the late 1990s. However, the paths of the Wintel duo have greatly diverged over the past decade.\n\nMicrosoft is an artificial intelligence (AI) leader that has expanded into other businesses, such as cloud computing, while Intel could be set to start losing its grip on the PC market to the more advanced Arm-based chips made by competitors.\n\nIn addition, Broadcom just dealt a big blow to the contract manufacturing business, launched in 2021 to help turn the company around. After testing Intel's newest manufacturing technology, the chipmaker concluded it wasn't viable for high-volume production.\n\nNvidia is the logical replacement\n\nWith Intel reeling, there are rumors that its days in the Dow Jones Index are numbered. The logical replacement would be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which is now the world's largest chipmaker. As its revenue has soared, the company has become the symbol of the AI boom.\n\nDemand for its graphic processing units (GPUs) is currently insatiable as technology companies rush to build out the data center infrastructure needed to power AI. Meanwhile, its chips have become the backbone of the AI buildout, with the company believed to have an over 80% market share in the GPU space.\n\nThe company's lead in the space stems from not only the technological strength of its chips but also the wide moat it has been able to create through its CUDA software platform. Developed long before AI became the next big thing, the software has been the standard on which programmers have learned to program GPUs, giving it the huge advantage it has today.\n\nMeanwhile, on top of CUDA, Nvidia has also built a number of microservices, libraries, tools, and technologies called CUDA-X to help increase its software leadership. It has recently introduced a number of new libraries for a variety of purposes, from data processing to gene sequencing to vector databases.\n\nWhile Nvidia is now synonymous with its GPUs being used in data centers to build out AI infrastructure, the company is not a one-trick pony. It also got a large networking platform when it acquired Mellanox back in 2020. The company now has three networking platforms, and its networking revenue doubled last year. While data center customers are its largest ones, the company also sells its products in a number of industries, including gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and automobiles, among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the Dow Jones wants to keep a semiconductor company in the index as a replacement for Intel, Nvidia is a strong choice. Unlike the S&P, which is a weighted index based on market cap, the Dow is a price-weighted index, so Nvidia's recent stock split could help it get into the index, as before, its price was a bit too hefty.\n\nThe Dow doesn't have any hard-and-fast rules for inclusion in the index. Its criteria are that \"a stock is typically added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth, and is of interest to a large number of investors.\" The company must also be headquartered and incorporated in the U.S. Nvidia checks all those boxes.\n\nThe Dow committee, which consists of two representatives from The Wall Street Journal and three from S&P Global, ultimately decides which companies get included and which are removed. If the committee thinks AI is set to become a large part of the U.S. economy, then Nvidia is the most logical choice to add. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nAt the end of the day, whether Nvidia gets added to the Dow likely won't change the stock's long-term performance. However, it would be some great recognition and could give it a near-term boost. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nEither way, though, Nvidia looks like a solid long-term buy, given its growth outlook and wide moat. Plus, with the recent sell-off in tech stocks, the stock is also cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27.4 and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just about 0.75.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) ‘Was Selling At A Remarkably Low Price’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer can't stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer advises that worrying about what others are concerned about or getting excited about what everyone anticipates is generally futile for investors. When most investors expect something to happen, it’s often already factored into stock prices.\n\n“You want to know the single most useless thing you can do in this business? Oh, that’s easy. The most useless thing you can do as an investor is to worry about what everyone else is worrying about. The flip side of this is also true: there’s no point in getting excited about something that everybody else is eagerly anticipating. Why? Because when the vast majority of investors agree that something’s going to happen, that thing is already priced into the stock market.”\n\nThe stock market reacts quickly to the consensus of hedge fund and mutual fund managers, so by the time the majority agrees on an economic trend, it’s already reflected in stock values. Cramer points out that while the real economy moves at a steady pace—through borrowing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling—stocks adjust almost instantly to new information. This rapid adjustment means that, once big institutional investors align on a particular economic outlook, it is already embedded in the market.\n\n“While the real economy moves at its own steady pace—for example, you have to borrow money to build out equipment, then use that equipment to manufacture goods, transport them to retail outlets, and wait for customers to buy them—the stock market has no such limitations. Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought, but they come pretty close. So, the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case.\n\nUsually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages.”\n\nThe Efficient Markets Hypothesis\n\nJim Cramer points out that understanding some basic economics can be quite useful for managing investments, even though economists often use complex models that don’t always align with real-world data. Economists can be too focused on their theories and may ignore conflicting data, but basic economic principles can still offer valuable insights. One key concept Cramer highlights is the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.\n\nThis theory suggests that stock prices at any given moment already include all available information. When new data comes out, stock prices quickly adjust to reflect this updated reality. Index fund advocates use this theory to argue that it’s nearly impossible for stock pickers to outperform the market, as all known information is already factored into stock prices.\n\n“This is some basic economics 101 stuff. Now, I don’t have a ton of use for economists as professionals on this show—they tend to take a totally ivory-tower approach to their discipline, meaning they have all sorts of models for how the economy is supposed to work (often very boring models, by the way). But they rarely let empirical facts get in the way of a good theory. If the data conflicts with the model, economists have a bad habit of throwing away the data, not the model. However, as long as you keep that caveat in mind, some basic economics is incredibly useful when you’re trying to manage your own money.\n\nFor example, let’s take something a little bit difficult, but we’re going to get through this together: what’s known as the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. This theory says that, at any given moment, stock prices already reflect all the relevant information that’s out there. When some new piece of data emerges, stocks immediately adjust to reflect the new reality. You often hear index fund purists citing this theory to explain why it’s impossible for stock pickers to get any kind of edge. According to them, whatever you know about a company should already be baked into its share price. As far as they’re concerned, markets are so efficient that investing in individual stocks is basically the same as gambling.\n\nJim Cramer explains that if all possible information about a stock is already reflected in its price, then doing detailed research may not give you an edge. In this view, the only factors that can move a stock’s price are new, unexpected pieces of information. If such information were known to anyone, it would already be factored into the stock price.\n\n“If everything you could possibly know is already priced into the stock, that means your homework is meaningless, and the only thing that can push a stock higher or lower is some random new piece of information nobody knows about. It has to be something totally unknown because, if anyone did know, they would have already acted on it, and thus it would be baked into the share price.”\n\nEssentially, they believe that only completely new, unknown information can influence stock prices, which makes individual stock investing seem like a gamble. Cramer acknowledges that while economists and their theories might seem detached from practical investing, understanding concepts like market efficiency can help investors navigate the complexities of stock investing.\n\n“This means that, under the extreme version of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, the only things that can move stocks are “unknown unknowns,” to use the parlance of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. And if you’re merely betting on unknown unknowns, you might as well just be playing roulette—it’s more fun.\n\nThat’s why index fund advocates adore the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. This theory tells them that it’s impossible for individual investors to consistently beat the averages. So if you want equity exposure, the only smart way to do it is by putting your money into a nice, low-cost index fund that mirrors the S&P 500.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article looks at a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he discussed several stocks. We’ve selected ten notable companies from his mentions. The article also explores how hedge funds perceive these stocks and ranks them according to their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least owned to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer explains that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) often appears expensive based on future earnings estimates, but it consistently surpasses those expectations, making the stock look undervalued in hindsight. This pattern has been a remarkable feature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) since 2012. Cramer advises investors not to focus too much on daily fluctuations in a stock’s price. Instead, it’s important to discern when these movements are meaningful signals versus when they are simply noise with no real significance.\n\n“When you look at NVIDIA on forward earnings or estimates, it always looks expensive, and then it so far trumps those estimates that when you look backward, it turns out the stock was selling at a remarkably low price. That’s been the secret to NVIDIA literally since 2012—incredible! It just keeps doing that, right? Please don’t put too much significance on day-to-day gyrations in a stock’s share price. You have to know when something is a signal and when it’s all just sound and noise, always signifying nothing.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a highly attractive investment due to its leading role in the semiconductor industry, particularly in GPUs and AI technologies, as well as its impressive financial performance and expanding market opportunities. As a dominant player in tech, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) benefits from the rapid growth in AI, data centers, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn its Q2 FY2024 earnings report, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved record revenue of $13.51 billion, marking a 101% increase from the previous year. This growth is driven by exceptional demand for its GPUs, particularly those used in AI and data centers, with the Data Center segment seeing a 171% revenue boost. This underscores NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s pivotal role in supporting AI technologies and large language models.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strong momentum is further supported by its strategic partnerships and innovative product offerings. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key player in the AI revolution, providing essential hardware to cloud providers, enterprises, and research institutions. Its recent collaborations to advance generative AI solidify its leadership position. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding into new areas such as automotive and edge computing, where its AI and GPU technologies are increasingly being adopted. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s ongoing investment in research and development and its robust product pipeline keep it at the cutting edge of innovation\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer can't stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Do Analysts Remain Optimistic About This ESG Stock?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other ESG stocks.\n\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\n\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\n“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”\n\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\n\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company’s Blackwell GPUs are up to 20 times more energy-efficient than traditional CPUs for specific AI and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks. Additionally, by the end of FY25 and each year after, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) aims to achieve and maintain 100% renewable electricity for its offices and data centers under operational control.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently announced plans to increase production of its Blackwell chips in the second half of 2024. Experts predict that its current-generation Hopper chips will continue to see strong sales through the end of the year, with Blackwell chips likely becoming a significant sales driver by then. Despite a reported delay in the release of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPU architecture, Goldman Sachs remains optimistic that management commentary and upcoming supply-chain data could boost NVIDIA’s earnings outlook.\n\nStifel also maintained its Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares with a price target of $165.00 ahead of the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The firm is optimistic about the demand for NVIDIA’s H-Series SKUs and expects that the company’s July results and October guidance could exceed expectations.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\n“There is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing.

And I’m not talking about the Irish Republican Army—I’m not even talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, for that matter. I mean the Individual Retirement Account.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it’s not always the best strategy for everyone.

While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there’s a lot the so-called experts don’t tell you or don’t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)—you’d have to be a fool not to contribute.\n\nMany experts will even advise you to max out your 401(k) contributions every year if you can afford to. Right now, the maximum contribution is over 20 grand, with room for an additional 7 grand if you’re over 50. It tends to rise gradually over time, usually a little faster than inflation. In 2004, it was $13,000; by 2023, it was $22,500. Either way, that’s a serious chunk of change, even with these contributions coming from your pre-tax income.”\n\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\n“However, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I’m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it’s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns—sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I’ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)—maybe there’s a better way for you to invest for retirement.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\n“There is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing. Money is just not talked about. Frankly, it’s become the third rail of American education.

However, despite these worries, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock recently rose by 4% following a very positive report from UBS. Cramer points out that, while there’s no new significant development, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s current high-end chips are sufficient to address any short-term gaps.\n\n“The rumor that NVIDIA’s new high-end chips were running late led us to believe the company was set back because of the delay, and that concern lingers. However, NVIDIA just jumped 4% on a very positive UBS report. There’s nothing new here at all, and even if there were, the company’s current iterations of high-end chips can fill the gap. I expect the stock to get hit again tomorrow. Many know little about the company. They say they love it, but it was a huge buy a week ago, ten points lower.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Q2 2024 earnings report shows strong performance, with revenue reaching $30 billion, exceeding the expected $28.72 billion. This success is driven by high demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI chips, which are essential for data centers and advanced computing. Although the stock has been somewhat volatile due to market conditions and profit-taking, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s long-term growth outlook remains strong. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from the growing AI sector, as its technology plays a key role in AI development across various industries. Analysts view NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a leader in AI, with potential for significant stock gains as AI demand continues to grow.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s dominance in GPU technology and its expansion into AI software and hardware further support its growth prospects. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s focus on innovation and market expansion strengthens its long-term outlook. While broader economic factors may influence short-term stock performance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s leadership in a fast-growing industry provides a solid foundation for sustained growth.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Best Hidden AI Stock to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Hidden AI Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other hidden AI stocks.\n\nCollaborative Partnerships in AI\n\nResearch and development in artificial intelligence began in academia and dominated the sector until the early 2000s. Later, this pattern switched up and industry took over AI with higher investment, research, and cheaper inputs. Investments in AI by businesses are also almost always followed by commercial applications, making it a more profitable activity than academia.\n\nWhile these commercial relationships flourish, many companies focus on taking collaborative approaches to partnerships, revolutionizing the AI industry. By partnering with tech giants, such companies are accelerating AI adoption, driving vertical growth through specialized models, and increasing demand for powerful computing resources. This strategic approach is shaping the future of AI.\n\nThis was recently discussed in another article, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5. Here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“OpenAI’s approach to fostering collaborative partnerships instead of competing directly with tech giants makes it an exceptional model. Macquarie’s Fred Havemeyer (lead software equity research analyst) praised GPT 4 for its “emotional intelligence”. The growing demand for AI chips, exemplified by OpenAI’s use of over 1.7 trillion parameters in its GPT 4 model, will further help NVIDIA and other AI chip manufacturers grow.\n\nOn August 20, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI is releasing a feature that will allow businesses to use their company data to customize GPT 4 so that it can be trained on additional information for niche tasks. This is an example of letting companies fine-tune the AI model to act as a customer-service chatbot for their subject areas. According to DeepL CEO, Jarek Kutylowski, specialised AI models are essential for companies to grow vertically.”\n\nEver since it was founded in 2015, this research company has promoted open research and collaboration within the AI community. By sharing its findings and models, OpenAI encourages other researchers and organizations to build upon its work. This has accelerated advancements in AI and fostered a more inclusive environment.\n\nOpenAI partnered with Microsoft so that the tech giant's investment ($1 billion in 2019) could facilitate deep integration of OpenAI's models into its products. Azure offers these models as compliance-ready solutions, crucial for industries requiring high data security.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was also followed by Brazil's partnership with the tech giant to use OpenAI to reduce judicial costs. By automating tasks, the Brazilian judiciary is expediting case processing and improving efficiency, saving costs in public sectors.\n\nIn a recent discussion on CNBC, Barton Crockett from Rosenblatt Securities and Amit Daryanani from Evercore ISI both agreed that AI is crucial for Apple's future success. Crockett emphasized that AI offers a unique opportunity to reinvigorate The company's device ecosystem and that consumers are increasingly valuing AI capabilities in their tech devices, and it seems to be falling behind in this regard. He suggested that partnerships with AI companies like OpenAI could help it bridge this gap and enhance its offerings.\n\nAccording to reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI is reportedly seeking significant new funding, potentially valuing the company at over $100 billion. The investment round, led by Thrive Capital, highlights the intensifying competition among tech giants for a dominant position in the AI industry.\n\nIn August 2024, WebProNews reported that OpenAI's user base doubled to over 200 million in a year and its annual revenue exceeded $2 billion. Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies now use OpenAI products. However, maintaining lead requires addressing practical, safety, and user-friendliness concerns. OpenAI's plans, including its new search engine, SearchGPT, aim to address these challenges and solidify its position. CEO Sam Altman believes SearchGPT can significantly improve search capabilities.\n\nThese instances leave us thinking about whether it's collaboration or competition that can help AI progress fastest. As the Managing Partner at Boldsquare, Dylan Jones points out, strategic partnerships can significantly impact a company's valuation. Tech giants' moves indicate a calculated effort to maintain their AI leadership, even if it means blurring the lines between collaboration and competition.\n\nIn a discussion at CNBC’s 'Squawk Box', CoreWeave co-founder and CEO, Mike Intrator, said that the demand for AI infrastructure is relentless and has been in a state of severe disequilibrium for the past 2.5 years.\n\nHe believes that the demand for Nvidia chips is skyrocketing, while the rest of the industry is trying to keep up with it, including CoreWeave. According to Intrator, CoreWeave and its clients anticipate significant growth in AI infrastructure demand. Due to limited industry capacity, clients are struggling to train and serve AI models. CoreWeave, with its ability to provide large-scale AI infrastructure, is well-positioned to meet this growing demand.\n\nHowever, startups often suffer at the cost of these partnerships, failing to compete with tech giants. Still, many companies are emerging and progressing at a good pace. In this context, we are here with a list of the 10 hidden AI stocks to buy now.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we reviewed media reports and watched Wall Street analysts' interviews to determine under-the-radar and hidden AI stocks. We compiled a list of 20 potential stocks and selected the 10 most popular among elite hedge funds that are expected to be key beneficiaries of the secular trends in artificial intelligence. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a leading semiconductor company that uses AI to optimize chip design, improve manufacturing processes, and develop AI-accelerated hardware and software solutions. AMD's AI-powered technologies help drive innovation in various industries, including gaming, data centers, and scientific computing.\n\nMicrosoft recently praised its Instinct MI300X AI accelerators as the best price-to-performance AI chip. This is significant as Microsoft expects to sell up to 50 million AI-enabled personal computers soon. The Instinct MI300 Series accelerators, launched in 2023, include AI and HPC chips that compete with Nvidia's H100.\n\nCEO Lisa Su highlighted the growing AI traction for its Instinct MI300X solutions. As leading cloud and enterprise providers expand their offerings, demand for AMD's AI chips is increasing. Additionally, Su noted positive demand signals for general-purpose compute in both client and server processor businesses.\n\nIn Q2, the data center revenue grew 49% year-over-year. Overall revenue growth was 8.88% for the quarter, recording a total revenue of $5.84 billion. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over the year. Gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, but Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nThe company's strong results and AI investments suggest a promising future in the AI market. It will benefit greatly from the growing AI spending. 108 hedge funds held long positions in this company by June 30. Fisher Asset Management had the largest stake, valued at $3,755,355,818.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investorletter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall AMD ranks 1st on our list of the hidden AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The revolutionary new technology that has disrupted the status quo on Wall Street has managed to shift investor attention away from economic turmoil to a specific set of firms that can benefit from the massive expected enterprise spending on accelerated computing and the associated industries needed to enable this shift. This has meant that despite the fact that interest rates have been at a 23 year high, the flagship S&P index is up by almost 44% since the close of 2022 while the tech heavy broader NASDAQ index has gained 63% during the same time period.\n\nOne technology that is part of artificial intelligence is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving, in its simplest form, is built on machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, so, autonomous driving is also artificial intelligence - a fact that is often left underappreciated by the broader media and analyst coverage. Autonomous driving uses neural nets to assimilate existing data and predict the behavior of pedestrians and other drivers. This ability offers the potential to create new industries, particularly where car owners provide their vehicles for autonomous ride sharing to earn money when they don't need their vehicles.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, consumer willingness to rely on shared autonomous vehicles for their trips over trips taken on existing private vehicles has only grown. As an example, its 2022 research showed that 56% of consumers surveyed were willing to use shared autonomous vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and were at least 20% cheaper compared to their private counterparts. Additionally, 34% of those surveyed wanted level 4 (L4) autonomy in their next vehicle purchase. Autonomous driving is categorized across five levels, with level 1 being simple features such as cruise control and level 5 being a fully autonomous system that does not require any human attention or interaction.\n\nMcKinsey estimates that revenue from autonomous ride sharing fleet vehicles such as robotaxis and robo-shuttles could touch $400 billion by 2030, based on statistics such as the German passenger car fleet of 50 million vehicles being parked 95% of the time and offering 250 million seats to meet the entire population's mobility needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, while we'll get to the strides made by Elon Musk's car company on this front later, other car companies have also jumped into the fray. For instance, the second best automotive stock to buy according to hedge funds has teamed up with Goldman Sachs' eighth best hedge fund stock pick through its Cruise business to offer autonomous ride sharing services to customers next year. This will be one of the first robotaxi projects of its kind, and its announcement came months after the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA) had shared its first ever State of AV report. It shared that autonomous vehicles have driven nearly 70 million miles on American roads, with most of these being recent as the number of miles driven had marked a 59% growth since July 2023.\n\nWhile big ticket car brands typically dominate the autonomous driving conversation, there are several private and small companies that are also 'driving' the mileage for autonomous vehicles so to speak. One such firm is Nuro, which aims to develop L4 logistics vehicles capable of making deliveries. It tests its products in a closed track in Las Vegas, and the firm has driven one million autonomous miles to date. Another firm is Gatik, which has partnered up with the second best hedge fund eCommerce stock pick and also the biggest brick and mortar retailer in the world. It offers autonomous transportation as a service (ATaaS) by operating box trucks that autonomously ship goods within different supply chain nodes such as fulfillment and distribution centers, stores, and warehouses.\n\nComing back to Elon Musk's car company, autonomous driving and robotaxis are at the center of its valuation, at least as far as RBC Capital and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest are concerned. According to RBC, Robotaxi's revenue can sit at $120 billion in 2040, with the autonomous ride sharing business accounting for 52% of the firm's valuation. Ark, as expected, is more optimistic. Its expected value for the car company's share price is $2,600 in 2029, which will be driven by $8.2 trillion in enterprise value, $1.2 trillion in revenue, and $440 billion in operating income. As per the hedge fund's research, 88%, 63%, and 86% of these values will be driven by Robotaxi.\n\nSince autonomous vehicles require GPUs to train neural networks, and big tech firms' insatiable PGU demand for non-autonomy related AI use cases has made these chips one of the hottest commodities in the world, a shortage in GPUs could impact the projected growth in autonomy. For instance, emails obtained by CNBC in June revealed that Musk had asked his GPU supplier to divert supplies intended for his car company to the social media firm X and AI company xAI. These shipments were worth roughly $500 million, and the latest earnings saw him share that he had no choice but to compete with the world's largest GPU maker.\n\nDuring the call, Musk outlined that since it was hard to procure the \"state-of-the-art\" GPUs, \" when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have — in order to ensure that we’ve got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with \" the GPU company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X's autonomy ETF that are focused on autonomous driving by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 1.20%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the global leader in designing artificial intelligence chips. Its GPUs are used to train neural nets and other software that forms the bedrock of autonomous driving. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also serves the needs of the auto industry through its DRIVE AGX platform that allows autonomous vehicles to process data from cameras, radars, and other sensors. Its brand name which stems from high performance products has allowed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to establish a robust brand name that has enabled it to land deals with big ticket car companies like BMW and Hyundai. The firm's criticality to the AI supply means that it stands to benefit from the growth in neural network training as well as from car companies that might be looking to develop in house autonomy solutions but skip the costs of developing in vehicle computing hardware. However, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is often vulnerable to high cyclical variation and inventory glut due to hot demand for its products and could face headwinds in the future if trade tensions between the US and China intensify.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\n\nMoreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Calls Vistra Corp. (VST) The ‘CeeDee Lamb of the Stock Market’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks You Should Check Out.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer thinks you should check out.\n\nJim Cramer draws an engaging parallel between fantasy football and stock investing as the NFL season begins. Cramer uses this occasion to introduce his concept of \"Fantasy Stock Football.\" He likens selecting stocks for an investment portfolio to drafting players for a fantasy football team, emphasizing how both require strategic thinking and role balancing.\n\n\"While you're enjoying the game, I want to get you into the NFL spirit with some Fantasy Stock Football.\"\n\nUnveiling Jim Cramer's \"Fantasy Stock Football\" Strategy\n\nCramer enjoys blending real-world sports with market insights to offer a unique perspective on investing. He notes that, like fantasy football teams, investment portfolios consist of various stocks that play different roles, contributing to overall performance. Reflecting on the previous year, he highlights that the 11 stocks he recommended have risen an average of 38%, outperforming the S&P 500’s 23% gain. This comparison underscores his belief in the strategic approach to both fantasy football and stock selection.\n\n\"Now look, I love comparing real teams and real players to my favorite stocks. These are two great tastes that taste great together. More importantly, it gives me another angle to help you—I’ve got to teach you about the market in any way I can. Picking stocks for your portfolio has a lot in common with drafting players for your fantasy football team.\n\nFifty-five million people do it. Different positions play different roles for your fantasy team, just like different stocks fill different roles in your portfolio. By the way, if you look at the 11 stocks I highlighted when we did this a year ago, they’re now up an average of 38%, compared to the S&P 500, which is up 23% during the same period.\"\n\nCramer's Warning Against Overreacting to Market Fluctuations\n\nJim Cramer highlights some key mistakes investors are making and emphasizes the importance of a strategic approach to investing. He points out that many investors are making errors by overreacting to market fluctuations and trying to time their moves poorly. According to Cramer, sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing and avoid making rash decisions.\n\n\"People keep making a ton of mistakes when they should really just be sitting on their hands. Sometimes the best thing you can do is absolutely nothing. Instead, they're acting out every possible fantasy nightmare when it comes to the market. Not only is it tedious and foolhardy, but it’s also very expensive for anyone who's running with this non-strategy. You can see the averages, which started out like a house on fire today, only to fizzle out by the end.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer: Trust Powell’s Strategy Amid Economic Data Volatility\n\nCramer criticizes the persistent doubts about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He believes Powell has managed the transition from tightening to easing policies well, despite earlier criticism for slow rate hikes. The ongoing panic over economic data—whether strong or weak—shows a lack of faith in Powell’s ability to adjust rates appropriately. Cramer asserts that the Fed will act as needed, whether that means a 25 or 50 basis point cut, and advises investors to trust Powell’s strategy rather than being swayed by market noise.\n\n\"There’s a belief that the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell will somehow screw up the transition as they shift from tightening to stop inflation to easing to combat recession. At this point in Powell’s tenure, I find it insane that he never seems to get the benefit of the doubt. Well, yes, he started raising rates a little too late in 2022, but it’s hard to blame him for that. Powell didn’t want to hit the brakes on the economy when we were still dealing with a healthcare emergency, which is why he didn’t tighten in 2021.\n\nWho would have thought that COVID would run its course so quickly? Who could have imagined that the Biden administration would be able to pass generous spending packages right when we stopped needing them, sparking an inflationary run? Since then, though Jerome Powell has done pretty much everything right. Once rolling, he raised rates with vigor because our country had some of the worst inflation in recent history.\n\nThe rate hikes, one after another, did manage to tamp down inflation. Everything that could be controlled by the Fed is now going the right way. Prices have come down all over the place, though many are still elevated compared to 2019 levels. But I don’t think anyone surveying the situation could honestly contend that Powell is going in the wrong direction...\n\nWhat’s most important, though, is that if you have faith in Jerome Powell, as I do, you know he'll give us a 25 basis point cut if that’s what’s needed. And if the economy suddenly gets weaker, then a 50 basis point cut would be on the table. Why is that so hard to understand? People keep freaking out about things that simply won’t be a problem, given that we have a competent central bank. They’ve done this during the run-up to every Fed easing cycle I can recall. You always get these tense moments—like right now—filled with wild swings, full of sound and fury, and of course, yes, signifying nothing.\"\n\nJim Cramer Defends AI, Calls Early Criticisms Misguided\n\nCramer addresses skepticism around artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it is premature to dismiss its potential. While current AI developments may not seem revolutionary, he believes that significant advancements, such as breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, indicate that AI’s impact will grow over time.\n\n\"We’ve gone from a world where artificial intelligence (AI) was supposed to solve everything to a world where AI is treated as just a robust sham, except for when ServiceNow gets one more contract, of course. At its apex, AI was supposed to make organizations much more efficient, improve gross margins magically, and create inventions vastly better than the status quo. Sadly, we don’t see much of anything tangible, other than competing chatbots—rivaling inquiry systems that can generate information in sentence form, including hallucinations. We’re told the whole thing’s a canard, and this reality has slapped true believers like me in the face.\"\n\nJim Cramer believes that dismissing AI as a failure is premature. He argues that people are underestimating its potential, as we are still early in discovering its practical applications. According to Cramer, recent advances in accelerated computing and generative AI have already led to significant breakthroughs, such as improvements in cancer diagnosis. While the excitement around AI in healthcare may suggest we're on the brink of a major revolution, Cramer points out that we're actually witnessing a gradual but important evolution in the technology's capabilities.\n\n\"Now look, I think that’s just plain wrong. It’s way too early to view AI as a waste. People know nothing. We’re only a couple of years into finding use cases, for heaven’s sake. We just got word that accelerated computing and generative AI have led to a breakthrough in cancer diagnosis, which could be very important. That’s a huge thing. But the hype of what this technology could mean for healthcare seems to illustrate that we aren’t seeing a revolution yet—we’re just seeing a faster evolution.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended various stocks. It highlights ten companies that Cramer featured and explores their perception among hedge funds. The companies are ranked from the least owned to the most owned by hedge funds.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Best Clean Energy Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires\n\nSolar panel workers installing a new farm for clean energy generation.\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 92\n\nJim Cramer points out that Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) has emerged as an unexpected growth utility, with its stock rising sharply due to its nuclear energy investments and the increasing electricity demand. He compares Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) to CeeDee Lamb of the stock market, noting that both are based in Dallas—Lamb plays for the Cowboys, a team Cramer nearly drafted. Cramer also highlights that Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is one of the few companies challenging\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA) in terms of performance.\n\n\"Vistra Energy came out of nowhere as a growth utility, with its stock soaring thanks to the company’s nuclear exposure and the realization that we desperately need more electricity in this country. I call Vistra the \"CeeDee Lamb\" of the stock market. Vistra is based in Dallas, just like Lamb, who plays for the Cowboys—whom I almost drafted. Vistra is also one of the few stocks giving Nvidia a run for its money.\"\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is a compelling investment choice based on its strong Q2 2024 results and positive growth outlook. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) reported an EPS of $1.43, surpassing the expected $1.38, and generated $3.85 billion in revenue, which exceeded forecasts by nearly 14%. This revenue growth shows the strength of Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s diverse operations across the U.S. power markets.\n\nDespite economic challenges, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) has maintained profitability with a solid return on equity of 21.05%, reflecting good capital management. Analysts are optimistic about Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s future, with \"Buy\" ratings from Morgan Stanley and UBS, and price targets above $100 per share. This confidence is supported by Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s strategic investments in renewable energy, positioning it well for long-term growth as the world moves towards cleaner energy.\n\nLegacy Ridge Capital stated the following regarding Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“One of the sectors we know well which had been out of favor for several years has quickly come into favor: Independent Power Producers (IPPs). We’ve written consistently about NRG and Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) since the 2019 letter, have owned each, or both, since 2018, and invested a meaningful amount of our assets in VST specifically the past few years. Nate and I intend on spending more time in the year-end letter on our updated views on the IPPs and our learnings from the on-going investment, but we were a bit surprised how quickly the narrative around these companies changed. Our Blue Sky 2030 estimates of intrinsic value converged with the share price 6-years before we thought probable. In the 2019 letter, with respect to VST, we wrote:\n\n“Over the next decade management should have close to $15 Billion to deploy to share repurchases. If you assume they have to pay an average price for the stock that’s higher than the current one, and they can only repurchase 60% of shares outstanding instead of the 100% the math implies, FCF per share in 2030 would be $14. That’s a $70 stock at today’s valuation, but a $140 stock at a more reasonable FCF yield of 10%.” And… “The IPPs are un-investable for most money managers, so there we are. When they become investable we’ll probably be long gone.”\n\nWe’re not exactly long gone, but sentiment has certainly surpassed investable. After 5+ years of VST trading between $17 – $26 a share—and $26 exactly a year ago—it hit a high of $107 in May on the heels of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) narrative and the implications for electricity demand. While we agree with the prevailing consensus view that more Data Centers will be built, Data Centers require base load energy, and that the US will probably be short base load energy, predicting the rate of any technological advancement is not our area of expertise, and we feel the margin of safety has dissipated. Therefore, what had been our largest position entering 2023 and 2024, and has been our greatest contributor to performance, is now one of the smaller positions in the fund.”\n\nOverall VST ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer thinks you should check out. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The company holds an 80% share of the AI chip market, and that has helped it generate triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter. As a result, the stock soared more than 2,200% over the past five years.\n\nBy comparison, its other top technology peers, including Apple and Alphabet, saw their shares rise in the double or triple digits during that period.\n\nThough I expect Nvidia to continue as a winning stock over time, from now until the end of the year another stock could step ahead. Investors have worried about Nvidia's dependence on AI revenue in an uncertain economy and the competition it faces in the chip market. In fact, Nvidia already has lost some momentum, falling 12% over the past three months.\n\nSo, investors could turn to another company that is benefiting from the AI boom but brings in billions of dollars in revenue from other businesses, too. This player might be more resilient through a difficult or uncertain economy, and my prediction is that this AI stock will outperform Nvidia by year end. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis stock is a household name\n\nThe stock I predict will beat Nvidia by year end is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Its booming e-commerce business sells essentials, general merchandise, and even various devices, books, and movies. It has become a household name, especially thanks to its Prime subscription service, with more than 200 million members.\n\nThis helped Amazon report more than $121 billion in North American and international revenue in the most recent quarter, gaining in both of these areas year over year.\n\nAnd the company might see more sign-ups for Prime in the coming weeks as it plans another Prime Big Deal Days sales event in October. With bargains exclusively for Prime members, these events are known to boost membership in the service.\n\nEven better, Amazon usually does well when it comes to retaining members. After a 30-day trial period last year, 72% of users subscribed to the service, according to Statista.\n\nRegardless of the economy, customers see value in a Prime membership because they can buy essentials for good prices and get fast and free delivery.\n\nOn top of this sure and steady revenue source, investors also benefit from growth thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, and this is where we'll find the company's AI strengths. AWS offers a broad range of cloud services, and it has gone all in on AI, selling its own lower-priced chips, premium Nvidia chips, a full-service AI platform known as Amazon Bedrock, and much more.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement says it aims to be involved in every layer of AI -- from chips to power programs to apps.\n\nAmazon's profit driver\n\nAll of this has helped AWS reach an annual revenue run rate of $105 billion this year, particularly important because AWS has traditionally been Amazon's profit driver. In the most recent quarter, AWS operating income made up 63% of the company's total.\n\nIn recent times, Nvidia's growth has topped that of Amazon and other tech companies and has wowed investors. But as sentiment becomes more cautious, investors might turn to companies such as Amazon that are involved in AI but are less dependent on it than Nvidia. Right now, both of these players are trading around the same level, at 37 times forward earnings estimates, and Amazon might seem like a safer bet for the price.\n\nThis doesn't mean Nvidia and the AI market won't deliver on their promises over the coming years; I'm confident that any short-term uncertainty in the market won't change this exciting long-term story.\n\nBut my prediction is that Nvidia, after recently losing momentum, might leave room for others to jump ahead on share price performance in the coming months. And Amazon is likely to take the lead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split AI Stocks to Buy Before They Surge as Much as 240%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The past few years have seen a return to the popularity of stock splits. The practice was a regular occurrence during the 1990s and had fallen by the wayside, but has experienced a renaissance in recent years. A stock split is typically the result of years of strong business and financial results, which fuel a soaring stock price. Over the past year or so, artificial intelligence (AI) has added a new element to the mix, propelling some companies to dizzying new heights.\n\nWhat's even more intriguing is that history shows the strong performances that precede stock splits tend to continue. Companies that conduct stock splits generally deliver stock price increases of 25%, on average, in the year following the announcement, compared with average increases of 12% for the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard.\n\nHere are three stock-split AI stocks that still have a long runway ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom: Implied upside 57%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with a boatload of upside potential is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). What sets the company apart is the breadth of its offerings, which include software, semiconductor, and security products across cable, broadband, mobile, and data center industries.\n\nTo give this some context, \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology,\" according to the company. This puts Broadcom in a crucial place in the accelerating adoption of AI.\n\nThe critical nature of its offerings is translating into improving results. In the second quarter, revenue jumped 43% year over year to $12.5 billion, driving adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 6% to $10.96. The company is still digesting its acquisition of VMWare late last year, which is weighing on profits, but management is predicting a return to form in fiscal 2025. The company's forecast suggests its robust growth will continue as management increased its full-year revenue guidance to $51 billion, or growth of more than 42%.\n\nBroadcom's track record of consistent growth and savvy business moves led to its 10-for-1 stock split in mid-July. Despite delivering gains of 173% since the start of 2023 -- which marked the kickoff of the AI revolution -- many Wall Street analysts are still remarkably bullish.\n\nRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann is the company's biggest bull. Just ahead of the split, he reiterated his buy rating and increased his price target to a Street-high, split-adjusted $240. This represents potential gains for investors of 57% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMosesmann believes management's guidance still leaves room for additional upside, driven higher by sales of AI-centric application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and chips used in networking and switching. He also believes that VMWare will soon begin to contribute meaningfully to Broadcom's results.\n\nThe analyst isn't alone in his bullish prognostication regarding Broadcom. Of the 39 analysts who issued an opinion in August, 35 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 85%\n\nThe second stock-split stock with plenty of upside potential is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that revolutionized video games, cloud computing, and data centers. This technology has become the gold standard for processing generative AI, as its GPUs provide the computational horsepower needed for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), Nvidia generated record quarterly revenue of $30 billion, up 122% year over year, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67, which surged 168%. The blockbuster results were primarily driven by the data center segment -- which includes the chips used for processing AI -- as revenue soared 154% to $26.3 billion.\n\nA series of blockbuster quarters have fueled a blistering rise in Nvidia's stock price, which has gained 639% since the start of last year, prompting its well-received 10-for-1 stock split in June. In recent months, some investors have begun to wonder if its winning streak can continue, but many on Wall Street believe there's a long road ahead. Just this week, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating and Street-high price target of $200 on Nvidia, which represents potential gains of 85% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes Nvidia is a victim of its own success, saying its falling gross margin is a \"high-class problem\" to have. He notes that demand for the company's current Hopper chips is \"much stronger\" than many expected, while Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell processor will be \"ramping hard\" heading into the January quarter.\n\nHe isn't the only one who believes the future is bright. Of the 58 analysts who issued an opinion in August, 92% rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside 240%\n\nThe last of our trifecta of stock-split stocks with plenty of upside ahead is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The company has been at the forefront of custom server design for more than three decades.\n\nSupermicro's rack-scale servers have a unique building-block architecture, allowing users to design a device best suited to their needs. Furthermore, Supermicro offers leading-edge direct liquid cooling (DLC), which is the technology of choice for AI-centric data centers. In fact, CEO Charles Liang estimates the company has a DLC market share of between 70% and 80%.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), Supermicro generated record revenue of $5.3 billion, up 143% year over year and 38% quarter over quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.25, up 78%. The company's declining profit margin caught some investors off guard, but Liang cited a temporary bottleneck and product mix for the issue and expects a recovery in short order.\n\nHowever, the past couple of weeks have been challenging for Supermicro investors. Last week, the company was the subject of a short attack by Hindenburg Research, alleging accounting issues, third-party transactions, and violating sanctions, among other allegations. The next day, Supermicro said it would be late filing its annual report. This double dose of uncertainty dragged the stock lower.\n\nMost on Wall Street brushed off the report, saying it was a rehash of known and existing issues. The company has since issued a letter stating it doesn't \"anticipate any material changes\" to its fourth-quarter or fiscal 2024 results.\n\nSupermicro's strong track record has resulted in share price gains of 438% since AI took the spotlight early last year. This encouraged the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split early last month. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah maintains a buy rating and Street-high price target of $1,500 on the stock. That represents potential upside of 240% compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst cites Supermicro's position in the AI server industry and the company's leadership in terms of complexity and scale. He further suggests the company's sales will accelerate to a run rate of $40 billion by the end of fiscal 2026, up from management's forecast of $28 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nMany of his colleagues on Wall Street are behind him. Of the 17 analysts who covered the stock in August, 12 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nA note on valuation\n\nIt's important to note that these stocks have valuations commensurate with the opportunity. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Supermicro are currently trading for 38 times, 32 times, and 13 times forward earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nThat said, given their track record of robust growth and the secular tailwinds resulting from AI, I would argue they are still attractively priced.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Really as Popular as You Think? 1 Number That Has Me Concerned About the Company's Long-Term Prospects.",
        "content": "When the word \"semiconductor\" is mentioned, it's nearly impossible not to think of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- and for good reason. Over the last five years, the company has grown its revenue and free cash flow by nearly 900% and 800%, respectively. With that level of growth, it's no wonder industry analysts estimate that Nvidia holds at least 80% market share in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip realm.\n\nBy all accounts, Nvidia looks unstoppable. However, what goes up must eventually come down, right?\n\nWhile analyzing Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report, I stumbled across a metric that required a second look because I couldn't believe what I saw. Specifically, I'm beginning to realize that Nvidia's customer concentration trends might suggest the company's growth could come to a screeching halt -- and I think many investors could be caught off guard.\n\nLet's take a look at Nvidia's customer concentration profile and explore why this is important to understand.\n\nWhat is customer concentration, and why is it important?\n\nCustomer concentration measures a business's revenue across its client roster. It helps answer questions seeking to hone in on how much sales are related to a specific customer or group of customers. For example, let's say you have a business with 10 customers, and they collectively generate $1 million in annual sales. However, one customer is responsible for $500K. As an investor, would you be comfortable buying a business that relies on just one client for 50% of its annual revenue? Probably not. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat does Nvidia's customer concentration look like?\n\nIn late August, Nvidia reported earnings for its second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Per the company's 10Q filing, 46% of total revenue came from just four customers. That's right -- almost half of Nvidia's $30 billion in quarterly revenue came from only four customers. Although quarterly business trends can fluctuate dramatically, a look at Nvidia's historical customer concentration metrics could suggest the company's growth is increasingly hinging on a particularly small cohort.\n\nDuring Nvidia's first quarter (ended April 28), the company noted that 24% of total revenue was attributed to two direct customers and that two indirect customers each accounted for at least 10% of revenue. One of these indirect customers actually purchased their products through one of Nvidia's largest direct clients.\n\nIn its annual report for fiscal year 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia disclosed that 13% of total revenue for the year hailed from one customer (noted as Customer A). The company further informed investors that \"one indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTo put all this into perspective, Nvidia disclosed that no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during fiscal years 2023 or 2022. Clearly, over just the last year or so, Nvidia has experienced soaring demand for its chips -- but much of this growth seems to consistently come from a limited number of customers.\n\nWhy is this particularly worrisome for Nvidia?\n\nIt's one thing to be concerned about rising customer concentration trends. However, looking at who this growth may be coming from brings an additional layer of alarm when assessing Nvidia's growth prospects. While I cannot say for certain which companies are specifically in Nvidia's top four, there are some good reasons to believe that much of the company's growth can be traced back to the \"Magnificent Seven\" members.\n\nOver the last year, executives such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have cited that Meta and Tesla are aggressively buying Nvidia's highly popular H100 graphic processing unit (GPU). This is great news at face value. Being the AI chip of choice for two of the world's largest technology enterprises is more than just a nod of approval. However, investors shouldn't be jumping for joy.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call earlier in the summer, Musk gave some heavy signals that the company may seek to compete with Nvidia down the road. Moreover, Meta has been increasing its investments in capital expenditures (capex) -- and not all of that is good news for Nvidia. Meta has developed its own chip, dubbed Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), in an effort to move away from such a heavy dependence on Nvidia. On top of this, e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut Amazon has also doubled down on its own AI roadmap -- part of which includes developing its own training and inferencing chips.\n\nTo be clear, I don't see the rising competition as an Achilles' heel for Nvidia. Even if big tech begins to scale down their orders from Nvidia, I surmise the company will have little trouble finding new business. The real concern is that I think Nvidia will lose pricing power as more players enter the chip realm. So, even though Nvidia will likely still generate solid growth, I think the days of triple-digit revenue and profit acceleration could be nearing a close.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) you see today is very different from the Big Blue of yesteryear. The company moved from an all-you-can-eat technology buffet to a software-and-services expert with a heavy dose of artificial intelligence (AI) -- just in time for the ongoing AI boom.\n\nAnd IBM will keep changing from here. Let's check out the plans this technology veteran has for the next five years.\n\nIBM's long road to AI mastery\n\nYou already know all about IBM's long history in AI research. For example, the company still highlights the Big Blue chess computer's 1997 victory over human world champion Garry Kasparov on its investor relations site. That was an early example of AI beating humans in a complex task, using a supercomputer with number-crunching powers comparable to a 2011-era smartphone.\n\nAnd IBM remains an AI leader today, though its business-focused research might not inspire a lot of headlines. The Watson AI engine delivers data analytics and generative AI services with some unusual qualities. Above all else, the company makes sure that Watson's output can be traced back to the original sources, helping clients avoid pitfalls such as AI hallucinations, copyright infringement, and low-quality data sources.\n\nThe company also designs its own AI accelerator chips, complementing its use of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) processors. AI accelerators are already moving into IBM's classic range of Z-system mainframe servers. Going beyond today's traditional chip architectures, Big Blue even chases next-generation leadership as an innovator in the quantum computing space.\n\nQuantum computers will probably not be ready for prime time five years from now. That's a longer-term ambition, but an important one that should always be on your mind when analyzing IBM's long-term future. Come back in 10 or 15 years, and you'll probably see quantum processors in that era's mainframe systems.\n\nSo I'm looking at an experienced technology leader with robust AI business prospects in the near term and quantum plans further down the road. Management is covering all the bases in terms of growth-boosting technologies.\n\n\"Leadership is not a birthright,\" Arvind Krishna said in October 2020, six months after taking office as IBM's CEO. \"It takes perpetual reinvention. It requires working tirelessly to innovate. It demands a willingness to question tired traditions. And it implies making big, bold decisions to be on the right path.\"\n\nYou're seeing the results of that re-innovation effort these days. As a result, IBM should deliver fantastic financial results in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent performance and growth prospects\n\nIBM's revamped business focus was years in the making, and the transition was painful for long-term investors like yours truly. The stock gained just 28% over the last 13 years, lagging far behind the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's 371% gain. The company did better in terms of total returns, which include the value of reinvested dividends, but it still couldn't keep up with the broader market across this very long transition: IBM Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt's hard to say whether the next era of AI-powered growth will make up for the market pain of years past, but this certainly looks like a good entry point for new IBM investors.\n\nSales are up by 4.5% in two years, in spite of significant currency exchange headwinds. Free cash flow rose by 61% over the same time span. A leaner, meaner IBM should continue to grow its cash profits over the next five years. And the stock is priced at just 14.7 times free cash flows and 3 times sales today, making it a low-cost play on the soaring AI market.\n\nI'll gladly hold on to the shares I bought in 2015 as the generative AI era plays out. New investors get a generous 3.3% dividend yield with their freshly acquired shares, but my effective yield works out to 6.5% after nine years of reinvested dividends. Patience is always a virtue on Wall Street, but there's no time like the present to get started on your own long-term IBM holding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Could Become the Next Palantir, or Even Better",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is quickly becoming the go-to provider of artificial intelligence (AI) software platforms for companies and governments around the globe. Evidence of this can be seen in the recent acceleration in the company's growth as well as its improving revenue pipeline. Both metrics point toward better times ahead.\n\nInvestors are noticing and have been buying Palantir stock hand over fist. The stock is up an impressive 76% so far in 2024, and the following discussion offers clues as to why that has been the case.\n\nPalantir's AI software platform has gained impressive traction\n\nWhen Palantir released its second-quarter results last month, the company reported a year-over-year increase of 27% in revenue to $678 million. That was a solid improvement over the 13% year-over-year growth the company delivered in the same period last year, as well as an acceleration over its Q1 revenue growth of 21%.\n\nThere was a nice jump in the company's customer base, as well as the size of the deals that it has been striking with customers. Palantir management credited its improving growth profile to the growing adoption of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). This is a software platform that helps enterprises and governments integrate generative AI into their processes to help improve operational efficiency.\n\nFrom helping customers build their own large language model (LLM)-powered applications to helping them accelerate their daily workflows with the help of generative AI, the usefulness of Palantir's AIP seems to have struck a chord with customers. This explains why the company raised its 2024 revenue growth forecast and expects its top line to increase by 24% this year to $2.75 billion.\n\nMore importantly, Palantir seems capable of sustaining its outstanding growth in the long term, considering that it ended the previous quarter with $4.3 billion in remaining deal value (RDV). The metric refers to the total remaining value of Palantir's contracts at the end of a period, and it rose 26% year over year in Q2.\n\nThis AI hardware giant is making strides in the AI software market\n\nSo, Palantir seems well on its way to making the most of the huge end-market opportunity available in the generative AI software market. However, there is another way for investors to capitalize on the booming demand for AI software, and a closer look could lead investors to think that it may be a better AI software stock than Palantir.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the go-to choice for companies looking to purchase high-end AI hardware so that they can train AI models, resulting in outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings in recent months. What's interesting is that CFO Colette Kress' comments on the recent earnings conference call suggest that Nvidia is starting to make a dent in the enterprise AI software market as well. According to Kress, \"We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with Nvidia AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Jensen Huang also commented, pointing out that customers can deploy Nvidia AI Enterprise software for $4,500 per graphics processing unit (GPU) per year. Given that Nvidia's AI GPUs are priced at $30,000 or more for a single chip depending on the configuration, enterprise customers looking to build and deploy AI models are getting a good deal through Nvidia's AI software platform.\n\nNvidia provides customers with multiple AI software offerings. For example, the company's AI Foundry platform, which was launched in July this year, is an end-to-end solution with which customers can build and deploy custom generative AI models. Nvidia offers popular foundation models that can be tweaked by its customers and quickly move AI applications (including chatbots, content creation tools, and document processing tools) into the production phase.\n\nNvidia also provides pretrained customizable AI workflows that can be used for extracting data from PDFs or deployed for creating customer service workflows, accelerating drug discovery in the field of medicine, or building custom generative AI apps suited to an organization's needs. What's worth noting is that the adoption of Nvidia's software solutions is increasing at a terrific pace thanks to AI.\n\nIn its February earnings conference call, Nvidia management pointed out that its software and services offerings reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. So, the company's software and services revenue run rate is set to double in the space of just one year. That's significantly faster than the pace at which Palantir's top line is set to grow this year.\n\nThrow in the fact that Nvidia benefits big time from the booming demand for its AI chips, which led to 122% year-over-year growth in the company's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to $30 billion, and it is easy to see that the chipmaker is the more diversified play on AI. Another point worth noting here is that Nvidia stock trades at 28 times sales, which is lower than Palantir's sales multiple of 29.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia is the more attractive AI stock when we compare the earnings multiples of both companies. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nSo, investors looking for a cheaper alternative to Palantir to take advantage of the AI software market's growth would do well to take a closer look at Nvidia, especially considering that the latter already has a flourishing AI hardware business that makes it a better growth stock to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "content": "If you had bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock 10 years ago, you would have over $220,000 today -- a life-changing return that demonstrates the power of long-term investing. During that time, the company has frequently crashed, only to bounce back stronger than ever.\n\nPast performance doesn't guarantee future returns, especially for a company already worth $2.93 trillion. But let's explore what the next decade could have in store for this iconic chipmaker and its shareholders.\n\nA history of boom and bust cycles\n\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia helped pioneer the graphics processing unit (GPU), a computer chip that excels at performing multiple tasks simultaneously. This hardware was a natural fit for the video game industry, where Nvidia quickly became a top supplier for early consoles and gaming computers when 3D rendering was new and exciting.\n\nBy the 2010s and onward, GPUs found a new use case in cryptocurrency mining, leading to surging sales and even shortages for many of Nvidia's advanced consumer-focused hardware. After COVID, the company fell into a major slump as gaming and mining demand nosedived.\n\nHowever, the launch of Open AI's ChatGPT in late 2022 gave the company a new lease on life. And now, its data center segment has overshadowed its formerly core businesses. In the fiscal second quarter, data center sales surged 154% year over year to $26.3 billion (88% of sales) on strong demand for enterprise GPUs. The gaming and PC segment only expanded by 16% to $2.9 billion (10% of sales).\n\nHow long will the AI boom last?\n\nHistory tells us that Nvidia is a highly cyclical company, which means its business performance can follow macroeconomic or industry trends outside of management's control. And while the company has done a good job responding to surging AI hardware demand, it can't single-handedly keep the industry afloat if demand weakens. This is something long-term investors should watch out for.\n\nWhile AI chatbots can be fun to play with, they have (so far) fallen short of the transformational megatrend promised. According to some analysts at Goldman Sachs, enterprise companies may never recoup the $1 trillion they are expected to spend on AI-enabling hardware over the next few years because of the technology's poor monetization potential due to computing costs and competition from free, open-source models. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's management disagrees. CFO Colette Kress claims that cloud providers could earn $5 over the next four years for every $1 spent on Nvidia hardware today. However, these enterprise customers are still on the infrastructure side of the industry. The real challenge will be monetizing consumer-facing AI software, which will need to generate profits to sustain demand for enabling hardware and infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia over the next decade\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict the future, generative AI hype could eventually fade, just like Nvidia's other boom cycles in gaming and cryptocurrency. The good news is that GPUs are a very adaptable technology platform. And they are already finding new use cases.\n\nOver the next decade, investors should look for Nvidia to expand into highly synergistic spaces like self-driving cars, augmented reality, and warehouse robotics as the technology improves. The company's brand loyalty (driven by unique software solutions like CUDA) could help it dominate these new opportunities just like it did with generative AI.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Nvidia's stock is not expensive at 43 times forward earnings, considering its triple-digit growth rate. However, investors should see this discount as a sign that the market is becoming less confident in Nvidia's ability to maintain current growth levels. Investors may want to wait until the AI bubble potentially deflates before taking a position in the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Artificial Intelligence (AI): Here Are 143 Billion Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "There is no denying that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stunning stock market rally since the end of 2022 as the rapidly growing adoption of this technology led to outstanding growth in the company's revenue and earnings.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's data center revenue shot up a whopping 154% in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to a record $26.3 billion. The sharp surge in this segment's revenue was the reason why Nvidia's overall revenue jumped 122% year over year to $30 billion, crushing Wall Street's expectations. Even better, the company's guidance was stronger than what analysts were looking for, but the stock price action suggests that the market isn't satisfied with its numbers and outlook.\n\nAI fatigue may have hit Nvidia\n\nInvestors don't seem to be too excited about Nvidia's performance last quarter as the stock has been heading south since announcing its earnings on Aug. 28. That may be a result of Nvidia expecting its top line to jump \"only\" 80% year over year in the current quarter to $32.5 billion.\n\nOf course, the chipmaker's guidance points toward a deceleration from the previous quarter's reading, but this was inevitable considering the massive scale of Nvidia's business and the revenue that it is generating already. Again, the relatively modest outlook as compared to the previous quarter may have created concerns in the minds of investors that Nvidia's eye-popping growth could eventually slow.\n\nThe good part is that the AI chip market seems set for impressive growth in the long run, which could allow Nvidia to maintain healthy growth levels thanks to its dominant position in this market. However, concerns about AI's ability to deliver enough returns for companies that have been pouring billions of dollars into this technology seem to be weighing on investors' minds.\n\nSo, it can be said that investors and analysts may want something more than AI to help reinforce their belief in the company's long-term growth prospects. This is where an emerging $143 billion market could come to Nvidia's rescue -- a market that's currently not big enough to move the needle for the company but has the potential to become a key growth driver in the long run.\n\nThis massive market could be the company's next big catalyst\n\nAccording to market research report aggregator Market.us, the cloud gaming market was worth an estimated $5 billion last year. But this market is expected to clock an impressive annual growth rate of almost 47% through 2032, generating $143 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe good news for Nvidia investors is that it isn't oblivious to this lucrative opportunity. The company already provides a cloud gaming service known as GeForce Now. Though Nvidia doesn't give away a lot of details about this service and includes its revenue within its gaming segment, it did reveal that GeForce Now had 25 million members last year.\n\nInvestors should note that GeForce Now has a free membership tier as well, so the number of paid cloud gaming subscribers Nvidia has is unclear. However, as per Market.us, GeForce Now had 9 million users until last year, and this lower count as compared to the service's overall membership base possibly indicates the number of paid users.\n\nThe number of GeForce Now subscribers is more than the combined user base of the PlayStation and Xbox cloud gaming users, as per Market.us. More specifically, Sony's PlayStation cloud gaming service had 3.6 million subscribers last year, while Microsoft's Xbox cloud gaming base stood at 4.2 million.\n\nFor comparison, the research report says the total number of paid cloud gaming subscribers stood at almost 30 million last year. Nvidia, therefore, has cornered 30% of the cloud gaming user base. More importantly, there is a good chance that it could convert more of its free members into paid subscribers thanks to a fast-expanding library.\n\nNvidia management said on the latest earnings conference call that it offers a library of more than 2,000 titles on GeForce Now, which the company claims is \"the most content of any cloud gaming service.\" But even if Nvidia manages to sustain a 30% share in the cloud gaming market over the next decade, it could pull in more than $40 billion in revenue from this market based on the $143 billion market estimate.\n\nHowever, the average spending by each cloud gaming user is expected to grow impressively in the coming years, according to Statista, jumping from $14 last year to almost $38 in 2027. So, Nvidia could enjoy a greater revenue share of the cloud gaming market in the long run which may exceed its share of users. More importantly, Nvidia has already built a nice user base in cloud gaming that it could eventually monetize.\n\nAll this indicates that cloud gaming could become a sizable business for Nvidia in the long run, and it won't be surprising to see the company generating a much higher figure than the $40 billion estimate. Cloud gaming could give Nvidia's gaming business a big boost in the long run considering that the company has generated just over $11.2 billion in revenue from this segment in the past four quarters.\n\nThrow in the secular growth opportunity in the personal computer and digital twin markets, there are multiple reasons for investors to remain bullish on Nvidia for the long run beyond AI. Buying and holding this technology stock for the long run could turn out to be a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "There's No Denying It; Nvidia Is on a Historic Run, but Here Are 2 Tech Stocks I'd Buy Instead",
        "content": "There isn't a stock on the market that has been talked about more in the past two years than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has made Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) one of the most sought-after products because of their role in training AI.\n\nIt has also made Nvidia one of the hottest stocks on the market. From September 2022 to the start of September 2024, its stock rose over 750% -- 18 times more than the S&P 500's gains over that span. That's not an easy feat for a company whose market cap was around $300 million at the time.\n\nNvidia has also posted financial results to back this hype, increasing revenue and operating income by 122% and 174%, respectively. The praise is well deserved. That said, there are two companies that I'd be more likely to invest in at this point because there seems to be more long-term certainty around their businesses.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) is one of the world's most-important tech companies despite not being a household name like some other big tech companies. It operates the world's largest semiconductor (chip) foundry, manufacturing chips for companies' specific needs.\n\nCompanies come to TSMC with a chip design, and it produces the chip according to the company's request. It may seem simple enough, but manufacturing chips with that level of precision and at that scale requires complex processes (putting it lightly) and advanced technology that no other company has been able to match.\n\nOne company that relies heavily on TSMC is Nvidia. TSMC manufactures Nvidia's chips for its GPUs, data-center processors, and other AI-related chips. Without TSMC's manufacturing capabilities, there's a strong case that Nvidia's products would take a quality hit. That's largely why Nvidia hasn't embraced other chip manufacturers and is comfortable relying on TSMC.\n\nNvidia's dependence on TSMC is why I prefer it at this stage. Much of Nvidia's high valuation is built on expectations of what it should become, and its ability to deliver on that will depend on TSMC's production capacity. The ceiling may not be nearly as high for TSMC, but its trajectory is seemingly more reliable.\n\nTSMC also has an attractive dividend that reduces some of the investing risk. Its dividend yield is currently above the S&P 500's average, making it easier for investors to remain patient during rocky times and trust its long-term potential.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) didn't reach the point of being the world's most valuable public company by mistake; it has taken decades of non-complacency and disciplined execution. With Apple's track record of discipline, it was puzzling why so many Wall Street investors were seemingly shocked as Apple remained relatively quiet during recent AI mania.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has a history of letting other companies create something and then venturing into that area with a much better design and making it more user friendly. We've seen it with smartphones (iPhone), tablets (iPad), smartwatches (Apple Watch), virtual reality (Apple Vision Pro), and handfuls of other tech hardware.\n\nOf course, Apple isn't just going around copying others; rather, the tech giant does a great job of letting others be the guinea pigs and then learning perhaps from their missteps before releasing its own products and services to the market. That seems to be the same approach it's taking with AI, too.\n\nApple hasn't rushed into AI like most other big tech companies. In fact, it doesn't even refer to its coming AI capabilities as \"artificial intelligence\"; it's \"Apple Intelligence.\" (It's just clever enough to work.) Nvidia is in a volatile position; just as fast as it rose, it can fall if it fails to meet expectations. Apple doesn't quite have that same risk, though it's not exempt from volatility. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nIdeally, Apple Intelligence will give Apple an immediate financial boost, with consumers rushing to buy its next-gen products since it'll only be accessible on newer hardware models. After a slump in Apple's smartphone market over the past few years, I'm sure the company wouldn't mind an extra lift from somewhere.\n\nShort-term boost aside, there aren't too many companies I trust more long term than Apple. The upside always seems to outweigh the potential downside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Intel Is Probably Getting Kicked Out of the Dow, but Nvidia May Not Be Its Logical Replacement",
        "content": "For more than 128 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has served as Wall Street's most prominent barometer of the stock market's health.\n\nWhen it debuted on May 26, 1896, it was comprised of 12 mostly industrial companies. Today, the Dow Jones is a melting pot of 30 time-tested, multinational businesses from an assortment of sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, the Dow has one major difference/glaring flaw when compared to Wall Street's other major stock indexes, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Whereas the point values of the latter two indexes are determined by market-cap weighting, the Dow's value is derived entirely from share-price weighting. In other words, the higher a publicly traded company's share price, the more influence it has within this ageless index.\n\nFor example, Walmart is a $620 billion company, as of this writing, and the fourth-largest Dow component by market cap. But its $77 share price is only 25th in the pecking order among the Dow's 30 constituents. The second-smallest component by market cap ($53 billion), insurer Travelers Companies, exerts three times the influence of Walmart with its share price of roughly $231.\n\nWhen Dow stocks underperform over lengthy periods, or their share price becomes too low, they're often at risk of getting kicked out of this iconic index. Semiconductor stalwart Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), whose share price has fallen below $20, is very likely going to be shown the door sooner rather than later. The surprise is that artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may not be the slam-dunk replacement you'd think it would be.\n\nIntel's time in the Dow may be coming to a close\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU) Goliath Intel was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 1, 1999. On a nominal basis (i.e., excluding dividend payments), shares are down 49% since this addition. But even with dividends included in its returns, shares have fallen by 7% in almost a quarter of a century.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, which is the body that decides which companies enter and exit this widely followed index, can't be pleased with Intel's performance or its now-microscopic influence.\n\nIntel's problems are threefold. First, it fell behind the innovative curve and allowed Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to become the undisputed top choice in AI-accelerated data centers. Even with Intel unveiling its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerating chip in April of this year, it's painfully evident that the company missed its early-stage sales opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, the company is building out its foundry-services segment from scratch. This includes two chip-fabrication plants in Ohio, as well as another in Germany. Despite its ambitions to become the world's No. 2 foundry by 2030, getting the infrastructure in place to make this happen is exceptionally costly and is weighing heavily on the company's bottom line.\n\nThe third issue for Intel is that Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has been (pardon the necessary pun) chipping away at its moat in legacy CPUs for personal computers and data centers. Even though Intel has retained the lion's share of the CPU market for PCs, ceding any share to AMD means giving up precious operating cash flow at a time when its foundry segment is losing money hand over fist.\n\nAlthough I believe the puzzle pieces are in place for Intel to execute a turnaround -- albeit one that takes multiple years to take shape -- its days in the Dow appear numbered.\n\nShould Nvidia replace Intel in the Dow? Not so fast...\n\nFollowing Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split in June, which decreased its nominal share price from north of $1,000 to $106, as of this writing, it would only be logical for Wall Street's chip leader and AI darling to take Intel's place in the Dow.\n\nIn each of the last two years, Nvidia's hardware accounted for roughly 98% of the GPUs shipped to data centers, according to TechInsights. Nvidia's H100 GPU and successor Blackwell chip, which is expected to begin shipping during the first quarter of 2025, shouldn't have any trouble maintaining their computing advantage over external competitors, which include Intel's Gaudi 3 and AMD's MI300X.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is helping to keep businesses hooked on its hardware. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build large language models (LLMs) and get the most out of their Nvidia AI-GPUs.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's dominance in AI, S&P Dow Jones Indices may be leery about handing over the keys to this AI juggernaut.\n\nTo start with, the Dow is traditionally comprised of time-tested companies. While this doesn't mean growth stocks aren't allowed in the index, it does mean S&P Dow Jones Indices generally avoids adding companies that are solely inflated in value because of the latest next-big-thing trend on Wall Street.\n\nOver the last 30 years, there hasn't been a single next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend that's avoided an early-innings, bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors regularly overestimate how quickly a new technology or trend will be adopted by consumers and businesses.\n\nWe're likely witnessing this same story play out with artificial intelligence. The simple fact that most businesses lack clearly defined blueprints as to how they're going to monetize AI all but confirms that we're in the early stages of a bubble-bursting event. S&P Dow Jones Indices is probably reluctant to add Nvidia for fear of an AI bubble taking shape.\n\nAlthough it's a bit of a nitpick, the second issue is that Nvidia's 10-for-1 split may have pushed its share price down too far for consideration in the Dow. Ideally, a $2.6 trillion company should have meaningful influence within the 128-year-old index. However, its $106 share price would rank it 23rd among the 30 components. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIf Intel gets the boot, this company is the best-suited replacement\n\nAssuming Intel's low share price gets it axed from the Dow in the not-too-distant future, the smartest addition wouldn't be Nvidia. Instead, networking-solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) would make for a more-encompassing add to this iconic index.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Broadcom recently completed a 10-for-1 forward-stock split, which reduced its share price from well over $1,500 to a more nominally appealing $154, as of this writing. This would rank Broadcom 20th in order of highest-to-lowest share price within the Dow.\n\nMore importantly, while Broadcom has, undeniably, benefited from the AI revolution, its sales channels are considerably more diverse than Nvidia.\n\nOver the last year, Broadcom's AI networking solutions have garnered a lot of buzz. These solutions are being counted on to reduce tail latency in AI-accelerated data centers, as well as maximize the computing potential of AI-GPUs. But there's so much more to Broadcom than just AI.\n\nIt's one of the world's leading providers of wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While some aspects of the 5G revolution have been underwhelming, a steady device-replacement cycle for consumers and businesses wanting to take advantage of faster download speeds has been a clear benefit to Broadcom and its order backlog.\n\nBroadcom also provides an assortment of optical products and networking components to the industrial sector and automotive industry, in addition to having an ingrained role in data-center networking solutions.\n\nFurthermore, it hasn't been afraid to use acquisitions as a way to expand its product and service ecosystem, or to promote cross-selling opportunities. The purchase of Symantec in 2019 gave it a powerful presence in cybersecurity solutions. Meanwhile, its $69 billion buyout of VMware last November positions Broadcom to be a key private- and hybrid-cloud solutions provider for businesses.\n\nIf Intel gets the boot from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Broadcom may be the best direct replacement.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Huawei prepares for launch, though of what product remains a secret",
        "content": "Huawei Technologies, the Chinese telecommunications giant, was reeling from US sanctions in 2020, cut off from key chip supplies. Last year, though, it stunned Washington with a new smartphone featuring an advanced semiconductor.\n\nNow, the company is poised to reach another milestone.\n\nHuawei's autumn launch event, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday in Shenzhen, will be led by its secretive chip design unit, HiSilicon. When the announcement of the event was first made, it sparked significant speculation thousands of miles away in the US.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nSome US industry analysts anticipate that Huawei will unveil a groundbreaking artificial intelligence semiconductor that could be capable of rivalling high-end chips that American tech giants like Nvidia are prohibited from selling to China.\n\nSuch a development, they say, might undercut the market share that Nvidia and other US chip companies have built in China and the Global South. It could also nudge Washington to reconsider its sanctions-based approach to curbing China's technological progress.\n\nEven so, the US government took one more step on Friday to restrict advanced tech access for rivals like China, when the Commerce Department announced that it was tightened export controls on quantum computing and advanced chipmaking tools.\n\nThe interim rules include exemptions for countries that adopt similar measures. Notably, the Netherlands, home to the Dutch tech giant ASML, has also expanded its export restrictions on advanced chipmaking technologies.\n\nHuawei faces significant challenges, analysts say, including reported performance issues and difficulties in mass-producing advanced chips due to those US restrictions and an underdeveloped semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nIndustry experts also note that Huawei is under intense pressure to release new products to compete with its US and South Korean rivals. The conference may reveal innovations beyond telecoms and chips, reflecting the company's portfolio expansion over the past five years.\n\nAccording to Long Le from Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business, the conference may spotlight two sets of its chips: the Kirin 9000s series for smartphones and the A910 series designed for advanced AI models.\n\nLe thinks that Huawei might introduce the most advanced version of its A910 series yet: the A910-C, an upgrade from the A910-B chip.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There's a lot of speculation about whether this will compete with Nvidia's H100 or B20 chips,\" he said, adding, \"I do think that the Huawei A910-C will be quite comparable to Nvidia's H100.\"\n\nHuawei is already a significant competitor to Nvidia in China, Le said, adding that \"a lot of companies\" were testing the A910-C.\n\nA Nvidia HGX H100 artificial intelligence supercomputing graphics processing unit (GPU) on display at the company's offices in Taipei on June 2, 2023. Photo: Bloomberg alt=A Nvidia HGX H100 artificial intelligence supercomputing graphics processing unit (GPU) on display at the company's offices in Taipei on June 2, 2023. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nAny breakthrough in this series, he said, would underscore how US bans on selling to Chinese companies might be driving increased innovation within China.\n\nIn October 2022, the Commerce Department enacted export controls to limit China's access to advanced computing chips, hinder its development and maintenance of supercomputers and restrict its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe ban prompted Nvidia, a tech company based in Santa Clara, California, to develop three chips specifically for the Chinese market. The most advanced Nvidia chip now available in China is the H20, a version of its H200 chip offered to other customers that is capable of running AI workloads while using lower computing power.\n\nThe research group SemiAnalysis has estimated that Nvidia could sell over 1 million H20 chips in China this year, generating around $12 billion in revenue. Due to weaker-than-anticipated demand when deliveries began in January, Nvidia has reportedly priced the H20 below a competing chip from Huawei.\n\nThe Chinese economy represented about 17 per cent of Nvidia's revenue for the year ending in January, down from 26 per cent two years earlier - due in no small part to those US sanctions and increased competition by China-based chip makers.\n\n\"It's really interesting to see that the ban has really created this innovation and self-reliance, paradoxically,\" Le said. If Huawei introduces a significant breakthrough at the conference, he said, US President Joe Biden might need to re-evaluate the sanctions his administration has imposed.\n\nAccording to Anil Khurana, executive director of Georgetown University's Baratta Center for Global Business, while the A910 series competes with Nvidia's H100, there remains a significant performance gap but pricing and production could be the key.\n\nA \"breakthrough\" at the conference, he said, could only occur if the company makes new manufacturing-related announcements. \"That's where Huawei always had big challenges, and that's not easy, because to do that they would have had to build a whole ecosystem,\" Khurana added.\n\nEven so, Khurana contended, Nvidia will \"certainly lose market share in China, whether it's in two months or six months\", saying that Huawei, with the A910, could offer \"an affordable chip for AI, an affordable platform for the Global South\".\n\n\"So the market for Huawei then is Africa, Asia and parts of Europe as well,\" Khurana said.\n\nHuawei advertises its Mate 60 smartphone, powered by a Kirin 9000s chip, on a company store in Shanghai on August 31, 2023.

Photo: EPA-EFE>\n\nHuawei is also expected to unveil its \"three-fold\" phone during the conference - within hours of the US tech goliath Apple's launch of its iPhone 16 series.\n\nPaul Triolo of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a Washington-based consulting firm, noted that \"there is a lot of pressure on Huawei to continue to release new products\". Those include advanced core semiconductors, cutting-edge smartphones and server chips essential for training large language models.\n\n\"The company remains under tremendous pressure to continue to show it can develop more advanced products and keep pace with the likes of Apple, Samsung and even Nvidia in the raw computing and consumer performance space,\" he said.\n\nTriolo noted that Huawei has evolved into a multifaceted technology conglomerate, with involvement in AI development, telecommunications hardware, consumer goods, autonomous vehicles and more.\n\n\"Whatever happens at the conference, Huawei's continued resurrection as the country's top innovative technology company - that has been able to withstand the full might of a nation-state arrayed against it - remains assured,\" he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past five years, up an astonishing 2,430%. Given those gains, the question many investors ask now is whether it is too late for new investors to buy in and see above-average returns.\n\nLet's look at four reasons why Nvidia stock is still worth buying like there is no tomorrow.\n\n1. It's still early innings in the AI infrastructure buildout game\n\nNvidia has been a huge beneficiary of the heightened interest in artificial intelligence (AI), as its graphic processing units (GPUs) are the backbone of the computer server infrastructure used to train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference. So far, demand for its GPUs and other chips has been insatiable as cloud computing companies and other tech juggernauts ramp up their AI-related spending, trying to stay ahead of the demand curve.\n\nConcerns are beginning to crop up that companies might be overbuilding needed capacity, but most show no signs of slowing down their spending. In fact, management at both Meta Platforms and Alphabet says the biggest risk related to the companies' AI-related spending is underinvesting and missing out on the huge potential opportunity.\n\nFor its part, Meta has said that training its new Llama 4 LLM will likely require almost 10 times the computing power of Llama 3. To handle that workload, it would need 160,000 GPUs compared to 16,000 for Llama 3. The newest Grok 3 LLM from xAI, meanwhile, is projected to require 100,000 GPUs, up from 20,000 used by Grok 2.\n\nThe exponential need for more computing power and GPUs as LLMs advance shows a potential very long runway of growth for Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Nvidia's software unit gives it a wide competitive moat\n\nNvidia isn't the only company cranking out GPUs. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) operates in this space and other companies are trying to make inroads, hoping to tap into the giant market Nvidia currently controls.\n\nIt gained that control because the company's chips long ago became the industry standard thanks largely to its CUDA software platform. The software platform was created by Nvidia back in 2006 as a way for developers to be able to directly program Nvidia's GPUs. It gave the software program away for free to sell more chips. As a result, CUDA became the primary software program that developers learned to program GPUs on.\n\nThis dependence on CUDA helped create a wide moat for the company's GPUs. While AMD has since developed its own software platform, ROCm, it isn't considered to be as good as CUDA. Also, the time and cost to retrain people on ROCm or other software platforms are high.\n\nStory continues\n\nCUDA helps Nvidia control the entire GPU stack from the hardware to the software and any firmware updates needed. Meanwhile, all of its technology is backward-compatible, creating a seamless transition for customers to build out their AI infrastructure and not have to worry that expensive hardware purchases from a few years ago become obsolete.\n\nNvidia's moat helped it capture more than 80% market share in the GPU market. In Q2, its data center GPU business saw its revenue soar 154% year over year to $26.2 billion. By comparison, AMD's data center business grew revenue 115% to $2.8 billion.\n\n3. Nvidia has accelerated its innovation cycle\n\nIn addition to the wide moat Nvidia created with its CUDA software platform, the company also accelerated its innovation cycle. It now plans to introduce updated GPU architecture platforms nearly every year versus two years previously. The company is currently seeing strong demand for its Hopper GPU architecture platform, introduced in 2022. It plans to start shipping chips designed on its new Blackwell GPU architecture in Q3 of this year (a short delay kept it from being introduced in Q2).\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has already announced plans to introduce its next-generation Rubin architecture in early 2026. Its release schedule also shows that its Ultra platform will come out in 2027. As noted before, all its platforms are backward-compatible with CUDA, so customers don't have to worry about their chips becoming obsolete.\n\nThis accelerated innovation cycle will allow the company to do two main things. First, it should help it maintain its technological lead on the hardware side as more competitors enter the market. Second, constant innovation should help the company keep its pricing power. Nvidia's chips are expensive and come with high gross margins, so it needs to stay on the cutting edge, which it clearly aims to do.\n\n4. Nvidia stock is still relatively inexpensive based on some valuation metrics\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of about 27 and a PEG (price/earnings to growth) ratio of just above 0.7, Nvidia's stock is still inexpensive for a company that has been seeing triple-digit revenue growth. That type of growth cannot last forever, but given the exponential computing power needed to advance AI and its wide moat, Nvidia still has a very large runway of growth in front of it. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nWith the stock price recently pulling back off its highs, now looks like a great time to buy Nvidia stock like there is no tomorrow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 1 AI Stock That Could Soar 215%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has so far been the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. However, the hedge fund billionaires listed below trimmed their positions in Nvidia stock during the second quarter, while purchasing shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia, trimming his stake by 8%. He also bought 1,040 shares of Supermicro, nudging his position 2% higher. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 676,242 shares of Nvidia, cutting his stake by 5%. He also bought 553,323 shares of Supermicro, upping his position by 807%. Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, slashing his stake by 79%. He also added 98,752 shares of Supermicro, increasing his position by 96%. David Shaw of D.E. Shaw & Co. sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 52%. He also opened a new position in Supermicro.\n\nTrades made by Griffin, Shaw, and Englander are especially noteworthy because they manage the three most successful hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Importantly, all four fund managers still have major exposure to Nvidia, so we cannot assume they view the chipmaker as a bad investment.\n\nBut we can assume the fund managers see Supermicro as a worthwhile investment, and two Wall Street analysts evidently agree. Nehal Chokshi at Northland Securities and Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt have put 12-month price targets of $1,300 per share on Supermicro. Those forecasts imply 215% upside from its current share price of $413.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Supermicro.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia holds a market share of more than 90% in data center graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that speed up the processing of complex workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The company accounts for more than 70% of AI chip sales, and some analysts estimate its revenue share is above 90%. Nvidia also dominates the market for generative AI networking, according to Morningstar.\n\nHardware leadership is fantastic, but Nvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with subscription software and cloud services, both of which generate recurring revenue. For instance, the Nvidia AI Foundry platform supports the development of custom generative AI models. And the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform supports the development of AI applications across use cases like robotics, recommender systems, and logistics route optimization.\n\nNvidia delivered a strong financial performance in its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended in July). Sales rose by 122% to $30 billion on strong demand for AI hardware and software. Non-GAAP earnings surged by 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Colette Kress said production of Blackwell GPUs would ramp up in the fourth quarter, about three months later than originally anticipated. Blackwell is Nvidia's next generation of data center chips. It offers up to four times faster AI training and 30 times faster AI inferencing than the previous Hopper architecture. \"The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,\" CEO Jensen Huang told analysts.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 37% over the next three years. That estimate makes its current valuation of 50 times earnings look reasonable. At that price, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the fund managers mentioned earlier have been buying Nvidia stock in the third quarter.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro develops high-performance computing platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its products range from individual servers to full server racks equipped with networking and storage. The company has secured a leadership position in the AI server market due to its internal manufacturing capabilities and its modular approach to product development.\n\nThose advantages let the company quickly build a broad range of server products with the latest chips from suppliers like Nvidia. Supermicro can typically bring new technologies to market faster than its competitors, often two to six months earlier. That time-to-market advantage should keep the company at the forefront of the AI server market.\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended in June). Sales increased by 144% to $5.3 billion due to record demand for AI infrastructure. But gross profit margin contracted by nearly 6 percentage points, such that non-GAAP net income increased just 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Management said its weaker margins came from temporary headwinds, but shares still plunged 20% the day after the Q4 report came out.\n\nShortly thereafter, shareholders got hit with more bad news when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging \"glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" Supermicro shares have plunged by 24% since the report was released in late August, such that the stock is now 65% off its all-time high.\n\nIn the last five years, Hindenburg has flagged alleged malfeasance at more than two dozen companies, sometimes with lasting consequences. For instance, Nikola shares have plunged 99% since the short-seller accused the company of lying to shareholders in September 2020. But some of Hindenburg's short reports have come to nothing. For instance, Block shares have advanced by 5% since the fintech was targeted by the short-seller in March 2023.\n\nGiven the available information, Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan is not particularly concerned about the allegations regarding Supermicro. \"We see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrongdoings,\" he wrote in a recent note. He also maintained his price target of $950 per share, implying 130% upside.\n\nMore broadly, Wall Street still expects Supermicro to grow earnings by 46% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 21 times earnings look cheap. Those figures give it a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.46, which is a substantial discount to its three-year average of 0.89.\n\nHere's the bottom line: The stock probably won't triple in the next 12 months, and there is certainly risk surrounding the short report. However, the current price is a reasonable entry point for patient investors, and Supermicro has a good shot at beating the market over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 37% of His $25.7 Billion Portfolio Invested in 5 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the current market rally -- and with good reason. These next-generation algorithms generate original text and images, streamline processes, and automate menial and time-consuming tasks, all with a few simple keystrokes. The potential for vast increases in productivity has companies lining up to see how they can best deploy AI to benefit their respective businesses.\n\nPhilippe Laffont knows a thing or two about profiting from emerging technology. The billionaire trained under the watchful eye of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson of Tiger Global Management. Laffont heads up Coatue Management, the world's premier tech-centric hedge fund, which he founded in 1999. Since then, he's parlayed $50 million in starting capital into a financial empire with $58 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, Coatue has far outpaced the returns of the broader market, delivering annualized returns of 14% over the past three years, compared to 8% for the S&P 500.\n\nLaffont believes AI will be one of the prevailing investing themes over the coming decade, and he has his money where his mouth is: Five top AI stocks are Coatue's five largest holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Meta Platforms -- 8.2% of holdings\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Coatue's largest AI holding -- and largest overall position, with nearly 4.2 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. Laffont trimmed the position by 3%, but gains during the second quarter left the position relatively unchanged. It isn't surprising that Meta is his largest position, given the company's long track record of using AI to its advantage. From surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms to recognizing and tagging people in photos, Meta was an early adopter of earlier branches of AI.\n\nThe company is something of an exception compared to its big tech colleagues, as Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to hawk its AI. That didn't stop the company from creating its homegrown Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama), which is available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Advertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue, so the company offers a growing suite of free-to-use AI-powered tools that help marketers on its platforms succeed, which keeps them coming back for more.\n\nImproving economic conditions are already lifting its digital advertising business. And at just 24 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive in light of its vast opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was already Laffont's second largest position, but he increased it by 7% in Q2. It now totals roughly 10.8 million shares worth nearly $2.1 billion. The e-commerce and cloud giant also has a long history of deploying AI. Amazon uses AI to surface relevant products for its online shoppers, recommend programming choices to its Prime Video and Music audience, determine the most efficient delivery routes for its e-commerce shipments, and plan inventory levels at its warehouses, among other uses. More recently, Amazon released generative AI tools to answer shoppers' questions and help sellers create compelling product descriptions.\n\nLet's not forget Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched Bedrock AI to offer the most popular generative AI models to its cloud customers. The company also created AI-specific chips -- dubbed Inferentia and Trainium -- to accelerate AI processing on AWS.\n\nThe improving economic conditions are expected to be a boon to Amazon, and AI will no doubt play a part in its success. And at less than 3 times sales, the price is right.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is the \"world's largest and best semiconductor foundry,\" according to the company. Since state-of-the-art chips are the heart of AI processing, it isn't surprising that TSMC is Laffont's third-largest position. He added more than 1 million shares in the second quarter, increasing his holdings by 10%. Coatue's position now amounts to 11.4 million shares, collectively worth roughly $2 billion.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has increased demand for the world's most advanced processors. TSMC dominates the semiconductor foundry space, with an estimated 62% of the market. More importantly, the company manufactures roughly 92% of the world's most advanced chips -- including most of the processors used for AI.\n\nGiven TSMC's pivotal role in the industry and the widespread belief that the AI revolution is still in its early stages, the next few years should provide a windfall for the company -- and its shareholders. And at just 25 times forward earnings, TSMC is still reasonably priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Nvidia -- 6.6% of holdings\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may well be the standard bearer for the AI revolution, so it's only natural it would figure prominently in Laffont's portfolio. Coatue trimmed its position by less than 1% during the second quarter, but the value of its holdings increased, thanks to 37% gains for Nvidia stock. Laffont now owns roughly 13.8 million shares worth $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the gold standard for AI processing in data centers and cloud computing, having previously been the go-to for machine learning,  an earlier branch of AI. Even with an estimated 90% market share, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and has accelerated its product release schedule to a one-year cadence. This dramatic increase in the pace of its chip development will make it even tougher for rivals to compete.\n\nThe triple-digit year-over-year growth Nvidia has delivered for five consecutive quarters is expected to decelerate this year but remain high by historical standards. Despite dominating the AI chip market, Nvidia stock is reasonably priced, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 5: Microsoft -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was quick to enter the AI revolution, integrating AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services and offering a growing suite of AI models on its Azure Cloud platform. That's probably why it's Laffont's fifth-largest holding, one he increased by nearly 21,000 shares in Q2. The position now amounts to 3.7 million shares worth nearly $1.7 billion.\n\nHowever, the company's biggest coup was likely the release of Copilot, its productivity-enhancing suite of AI-powered assistants. While Microsoft doesn't yet break out its results, some on Wall Street believe that Copilot -- and, more broadly, AI -- could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027. It's also having an impact now, as Microsoft's proliferation of AI services is having a halo effect on its Azure Cloud, contributing 8 percentage points of growth in its most recent quarter.\n\nThe stock is selling for 31 times forward earnings which is an attractive price given Microsoft's growth potential. META Chart\n\nAll long-term winners\n\nEach of these stocks is well known for dominating their respective industries, but it's their performance since the AI revolution kicked off early last year that really stands out. As you can see from the chart above, every one of Laffont's five top holdings have outperformed the S&P 500, and most by a wide margin.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually in the coming years, according to estimates compiled by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Some estimates are much higher. Given their pivotal positions in the emerging AI industry, each of these stocks is worth a look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "The last five years have been incredible for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors as shares of the semiconductor specialist have taken off in stunning fashion thanks to the terrific growth in its revenue and earnings, and a couple of solid catalysts in the form of video gaming and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAn investment of just $100 in shares of Nvidia five years ago is now worth a whopping $2,850. The stock's gains of 2,750% during this period have crushed the S&P 500 index's jump of 93% in the past five years. But now, Nvidia is the world's third-largest company with a market capitalization of just over $2.9 trillion. Expecting the stock to jump another 25 times to 30 times from current levels over the next five years doesn't seem logical as its market cap would then be worth a whopping $80 trillion.\n\nThe global economy, for comparison, was worth an estimated $105 trillion last year. However, it is worth noting that Nvidia still has solid-growth drivers in the bag that could allow it to sustain healthy levels of growth over the next five years.\n\nIn this article, we will take a closer look at those catalysts and check how much upside this semiconductor stock could deliver over the next five years.\n\nNvidia's latest results indicate its AI-fueled growth is here to stay\n\nNvidia released fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28. Its numbers turned out to be better than expected, with revenue jumping 122% year over year to $30 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by an impressive 152% from the same quarter last year to $0.68 per share.\n\nWall Street analysts would have settled for $0.65 per share in earnings on $28.7 billion in revenue from the company. This is not where the good news ended as Nvidia is expecting its fiscal Q3 revenue to land at $32.5 billion, ahead of the $31.7 billion consensus estimate. That would translate into year-over-year growth of 80%.\n\nStill, the stock has been slipping despite reporting such phenomenal growth and delivering stronger-than-expected guidance. This slight pullback, however, is an opportunity for investors to buy the stock as a closer look at its latest quarterly results indicate that it is witnessing solid growth across all of its businesses.\n\nThe data-center segment, which grew a whopping 154% year over year and clocked record revenue of $26.3 billion, is benefiting big time from the robust demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which are being deployed to train and deploy AI models. What's worth noting here is that customers have continued to purchase Nvidia's Hopper architecture-based GPUs even though the company is set to begin the production ramp of its next-generation Blackwell chips in the next quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs pointed out by CFO Colette Kress on the latest earnings conference call:\n\nBlackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\n\nHopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia believes that the next-generation AI models are likely to require 10 to 20 times more computing power, suggesting that the demand for its data-center GPUs could keep growing in the long run. According to one estimate, the AI chip market could generate $311 billion in annual revenue in 2029 as compared to this year's estimate of $123 billion.\n\nNvidia generated almost $49 billion in data-center revenue in the first half of its current fiscal year, indicating that it could end fiscal 2025 (which coincides with 11 months of calendar 2024) with almost $100 billion in revenue from this segment. Based on the $123 billion estimate of the overall AI chip market, Nvidia's share of this market could stand at around 80% by the end of this year.\n\nEven if Nvidia's AI chip share falls over the next five years to even 70% thanks to the emerging competition, it could still generate $217 billion in annual data-center revenue after five years (based on the $311 billion size of the overall market). In simpler words, Nvidia's data-center revenue may double over the next five years.\n\nThrow in the fact that the company's other businesses are also delivering healthy growth, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia becoming a bigger company over the next five years. For instance, the company's revenue from the gaming and AI personal computer (PC) segment was up 18% year over year to $2.6 billion.\n\nGaming has been Nvidia's bread and butter over the years, but now it contributes less than 10% to its top line. However, investors would do well to look at the bigger picture as the demand for AI PCs is set to boom over the next five years, paving the way for Nvidia to generate substantial revenue from the gaming and PC segment.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's professional-visualization revenue increased 45% year over year to $427 million thanks to the growing demand for the company's digital-twin solutions. As Kress remarked on the latest earnings call:\n\nThe world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed multiyear contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories.\n\nAgain, this is another lucrative growth opportunity for Nvidia as the digital-twin market could generate $131 billion in revenue in 2029 as compared to $26 billion this year, according to Mordor Intelligence. In all, there are multiple reasons why Nvidia could turn out to be a solid investment over the next five years.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nNvidia's healthy prospects are the reason why analysts have ramped up their revenue-growth expectations for the company's current fiscal year and beyond. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nSimilarly, its bottom-line growth expectations have also seen a bump. NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nThe good part is that Nvidia is expected to clock annual-earnings growth of 52% for the next five years. Based on the company's fiscal 2025 earnings-per-share estimate of $2.84, its bottom line could jump to $23 per share after five years. The stock currently has a forward-earnings multiple of 45. However, even if it trades at a discounted 29 times forward earnings after five years, in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward-earnings multiple (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could hit $667.\n\nThat would be a jump of over 5 times from current levels, suggesting that this AI stock could continue to make investors richer in the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Falls Again. Should You Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was among the tech stocks plunging today after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported cooler-than-expected job growth in August. Just 142,000 jobs were added last month, below expectations at 161,000, and readings from June and July were revised downward as well.\n\nThe news led investors to believe that the economy was weakening faster than expected, which could be particularly damaging for growth and tech stocks like Nvidia that are relying on billions in infrastructure spending to advance new generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.\n\nAs a result, tech stocks were down broadly with the Nasdaq Composite down 2.3% as of 1:19 p.m. ET, and Nvidia was off 4% at the same time after falling as much as 5.8% earlier in the session. The iShares Semiconductor ETF was down 4% as well, showing the chip sector was broadly impacted. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat it means for Nvidia\n\nIt's been a rough week for the AI chip leader. The stock plunged on Tuesday, seemingly because of rumors that the Justice Department had issued it a subpoena related to an antitrust investigation, though Nvidia later said that wasn't true.\n\nStill, today's pullback shows that the stock is sensitive to the broader macro environment. Investors apparently believe that a recession or an economic slowdown could slam the brakes on the AI boom as it would deter big tech companies and start-ups from investing in the new technology.\n\nThat would be a problem for Nvidia as its business and its lofty valuation is based on soaring demand for its data center GPU components, which are highly valued for their ability to run complex AI models.\n\nWhy it could be a buying opportunity\n\nThe jobs report is just one data point of many, and while there are other signs that the economy is weakening, it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner -- the unemployment rate is still low at 4.2%.\n\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates later this month, which should give a boost to Nvidia and the broader economy.\n\nThe stock did fall after its earnings report last week, but its overall numbers were strong. The business continues to grow exceptionally fast, and it expects to ramp up production of its new Blackwell platform, which is already seeing strong demand, in Q4.\n\nFinally, Nvidia's biggest customers, like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms, are unlikely to be fazed by a hiccup in the economy as these companies are sitting on tens of billions of dollars in cash and have all declared that investing in AI infrastructure is a top priority.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt would likely take a significant economic crash to derail their investment plans, meaning Nvidia is more protected from economic volatility than it may seem.

        "content": "Semiconductor ETFs Take A Beating, Dragged Lower By Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom Stocks\n\nSemiconductor, hardware, and artificial intelligence-linked stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are down as the sector continues to pull back.\n\nAI stocks led by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) selloff continue their downward price trajectory as the Nvidia and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly prints failed to impress the Street.\n\nBroadcom released its third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The topline grew 42% to  $13.07 billion in the third quarter, topping the analyst estimate of $12.96 billion. The chipmaker expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14 billion, above the analyst consensus of $12.70 billion. The adjusted gross margin grew by 110 bps sequentially and 230 bps year-on-year to 77.4%.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur projected upside, citing robust AI growth, VMware momentum, and recovery in traditional semiconductor sectors.\n\nLast week, Nvidia’s second-quarter topline grew 122% to $30.04 billion, surpassing the analyst estimate of $28.68 billion. It expects third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion-$33.15 billion versus the analyst consensus of $31.77 billion. The adjusted gross margin declined 320 bps sequentially and grew by 450 bps year-on-year.\n\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a bullish outlook backed by data center and AI training demand and supply chain recovery.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which tracks the overall performance of the 25 largest U.S.-listed companies that produce semiconductors, including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and AMD, has been down 12% in the last five days. iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell 12% in the previous five days.\n\nNvidia has been down 15% in the last five days.

        "title": "Nvidia’s $400 Billion Tumble This Week Makes Bitcoin Look Calm",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has wiped out more than $400 billion in value this week, weighing on key equity benchmarks as jitters spread over the health of the US economy and an AI trade that may have gotten ahead of itself.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nThe world’s largest artificial-intelligence chipmaker has shed a fifth of its value over the past two weeks. The declines also showcase a more pressing issue for investors in the $2.5 trillion giant: Its volatility now dwarfs its Magnificent Seven peers and makes Bitcoin look like a port of calm.\n\nNvidia shares have swung between $90.69 and $131.26 over the past 30 trading days, with a record amount of market value being wiped out Tuesday. That level of gyration drove its 30-day realized volatility up to 80 — more than four times the level of Microsoft Corp., double Bitcoin’s figure and higher than meme stocks like Donald Trump’s media company and Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc.\n\nThe stumble has pushed the stock toward its worst two-week stretch in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines came after a tepid forecast and issues for its Blackwell chip, which dented investor euphoria. Then came news that the US Justice Department sent subpoenas in an escalating antitrust probe. Adding to the gloom for chipmakers broadly, Broadcom Inc. released a disappointing sales forecast.\n\n“You’re just in a very difficult market environment right this second,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC, adding that the AI trade is still in its early days. Still, “on a day-to-day basis, where the bottom is, is anybody’s guess.”\n\nRewarding Year\n\nOf course, the stock has rewarded investors handsomely this year, even with the recent slide. The shares are still up more than 100% this year, adding about $1.3 trillion in market value. And Wall Street roundly expects that Nvidia remains well positioned as companies build out infrastructure related to AI, a process that’s expected to last for several more quarters at least.\n\nNvidia’s biggest customers — notably Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which together comprise more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show — affirmed their spending plans in their most recent quarters.\n\nNvidia’s results last week confirmed this rosy view. Revenue more than doubled and came in better than expected, as did adjusted earnings. The company also gave a revenue forecast that beat the analyst consensus, though it failed to meet the high end of estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat result underwhelmed market participants who had grown accustomed to blowout reports. It also fed into concerns for those who are skeptical about the long-term outlook for spending on AI.\n\nIt all means that as investors digest the evolution of the AI theme, the volatility in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers will likely persist. For money managers who want to get in for the long haul, that could spell opportunity.\n\n“For a long-term investor, this is a good time to start picking away,” said Williams at Wayve Capital. “If somebody handed me new money today, I would be enthusiastically adding some AI-related stocks.”\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Stocks Tumble On Jobs Data, Nasdaq 100 Eyes Worst Week In 2 Years As Semiconductors Slump: What's Driving Markets Friday?\n\nInvestors showed little enthusiasm for the August jobs report, as the slower-than-expected hiring numbers deepened worries about a softening labor market.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 142,000 nonfarm jobs in August, up from July's 89,000 but falling short of the projected 160,000. The unemployment rate edged down by 0.1% to 4.3%, in line with expectations, while wages saw stronger-than-anticipated growth, rising 0.4% month-over-month.\n\nOn Friday, markets shifted sharply into risk-off mode, with all major indices dropping over 1% by midday trading in New York.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) spiked over 17% to 23 points. The Nasdaq 100 led the decline, losing over 5% for the week, eyeing its worst performance since September 2022.\n\nSemiconductors dragged down the tech-heavy index. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SOXX) dropped nearly 5%, while Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell more than 4%. The chipmaker giant extended the weekly loss to 14%, on track for its steepest decline since October 2022.\n\nInvestors dumped equities and moved into cash as the U.S. dollar strengthened despite weaker-than-expected nonfarm payroll data.\n\nIn the bond market, short-term Treasury yields tumbled, bringing the yield curve back to a normal shape after two years of inversion. The two-year Treasury yield fell below the 10-year, signaling a shift in economic outlook.\n\nCommodities took heavy losses across the board. Gold dropped 0.9%, silver plunged 3.1% and crude oil (WTI) slid 3%, reaching $66 per barrel, the lowest since May 2023.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) also dropped, losing over 3%, as investors steered clear of crypto assets amid a broad-based decline in risk appetite.\n\nFriday’s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Dow Jones 40,320.98 -1.1% S&P 500 5,406.64 -1.8% Russell 2000 2,092.33 -2.2% Nasdaq 100 18,424.39 -2.7%\n\nUpdated at 12:50 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.8% lower to $539.77.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Again Today",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is getting hit with another day of big sell-offs Friday. The company's share price was down 4.5% as of 1:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia stock is losing ground in conjunction with an underwhelming jobs published by the U.S. Labor Department today. Recent news about an investigation into the company by the Department of Justice (DoJ) on antitrust grounds is also playing a role in the pullback.\n\nDisappointing jobs numbers are dragging Nvidia stock down\n\nStarting in 2022, the Federal Reserve began an aggressive campaign of interest rate increases designed to combat roaring inflation. The U.S. central banking authority had sought to engineer an economic soft landing that would slow currency devaluation while also avoiding a recession.\n\nWhile the Fed is widely expected to finally deliver an interest rate cut later this month, investors have recently become more skeptical about the likelihood of the soft-landing scenario being achieved. The jobs report published by the Labor Department today have provided the latest bit of bad news on that front, and Nvidia and other growth stocks are getting hit particularly hard.\n\nAccording to the data, the U.S. added 142,000 jobs in August -- falling short of the average Wall Street target's call for 160,000 new job additions. The size of the miss is particularly notable because analysts and economists had already started to revise targets downward in light of other economic indicators. For example, investors received news earlier in the week that U.S. manufacturing production had declined again last month. So even though the long-awaited pivot to rate cuts now appears to be imminent, investors may not be getting the bullish macroeconomic backdrop they had hoped for.\n\nIs Nvidia in danger of an antitrust suit?\n\nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg published a report stating that Nvidia had received a subpoena from the Justice Department as part of an antitrust investigation. The media outlet first reported on the probe in June, and its subpoena report raised concerns that the investigation was escalating and prompted sell-offs of the artificial intelligence (AI) leader's stock.\n\nNvidia responded publicly to Bloomberg's report yesterday and stated that it had not been subpoenaed by the DoJ, which helped spur a rebound for the stock, but the possibility of a looming antitrust suit was thrust back into the spotlight. In a report published today, Business Insider detailed a letter written by Senator Elizabeth Warren voicing support for an antitrust investigation into Nvidia. Warren raised concerns that the company has become too influential in the AI space and stated that its dominant market position posed \"dire economic risks.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the foundational hardware for AI training and other applications, and the company has a commanding lead in the product category. But while the company dominates the advanced GPU market, it's not clear that the DoJ would win an antitrust suit against the company even if it decided to pursue such action.\n\nFor risk-tolerant investors willing to embrace volatility, recent pullbacks for Nvidia stock could be a worthwhile buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $656,938!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Treasury Yields Plunge, TLT ETF Tops $100, VIX Spikes As 50-Basis-Point Rate Cut Odds Soar In Response To Jobs Data\n\nThe U.S. Treasury market rallied sharply on Friday after August labor data showed weaker-than-expected job growth, bolstering bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nThe U.S. economy added 142,000 nonfarm payrolls last month, an increase from 89,000 in July but missing the expected increase to 160,000. The unemployment rate ticked down by 0.1% to 4.3% as expected, while wages displayed higher-than-forecasted growth.\n\nMarket-implied odds of a 50-basis-point rate cut in September surged to 61% as of 11:05 a.m. in New York, overtaking the 39% probability of a 25-basis-point cut, according to the CME Group‘s FedWatch data.\n\nSeptember Rate-Cut Probabilities After August Jobs Data\n\nSeptember Rate Cut Now* 1 day ago (Sept. 5, 2024) 1 Week ago (Aug. 30, 2024) 50 basis points (0.5%) 61% 40% 30% 25 basis points (0.25%) 39% 60% 70%\n\n* Data as of Sept. 6, 2024 11:05 a.m. ET, CME FedWatch\n\nTraders poured into bonds amid growing expectations of declining interest rates, driving yields sharply lower across the Treasury curve.\n\nThe policy-sensitive two-year yield dropped over 10 basis points, reaching 3.59% at 11:15 a.m. in New York, its lowest level since March 2023.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell 6 basis points to 3.67%, marking its lowest point since June 2023.\n\nThis movement has led to a positive slope in the Treasury yield curve from the 10-year onward, effectively ending the more than two-year period of yield curve inversion.\n\nChart: US Yield Curve Normalizes, Ending 2-Year Inversion\n\nMarket Reactions\n\nRate-cut expectations and falling Treasury yields triggered sharp moves across asset classes, with bonds rallying, the dollar weakening against the yen and equity markets sliding.\n\n“No sooner than the payroll print hit, the algorithms marched into high gear, pushing Treasury yields lower as the disappointing headline number, coupled with a series of downward revisions, suggested a more dire economic backdrop perhaps requiring a heavier dose of Fed medicine on Sept. 18,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nMarkets are wrestling with whether the August payroll data signals a labor market returning to pre-COVID norms or an economy losing critical momentum, Krosby said.\n\nTreasury-related ETFs surged, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rising 1.1% to $100.65, on pace for its highest close since late July 2023. The Japanese yen strengthened as well, with the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) gaining over 1%, poised to close at its highest level since early January 2024. Volatility spiked, as the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) jumped 14% to 23. Wall Street flipped to the red, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) dropping 1.5% on Friday, extending its weekly decline to 3.9%, on track for the worst weekly performance since March 2023. Tech stocks were hit hardest, with the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) down 2.4%, pushing its weekly loss past 5%. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) tumbled 4%, extending its weekly loss to 14%, its worst performance in two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nAI Tech Sector ‘Is Not In A Bubble,’ But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Treasury Yields Plunge, TLT ETF Tops $100, VIX Spikes As 50-Basis-Point Rate Cut Odds Soar In Response To Jobs Data originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "SMCI Gains 45.1% YTD: Can Strong AI Focus Drive the Stock Beyond?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI has been on a remarkable run, with its shares climbing 45.1% in the year-to-date period. This performance has significantly outpaced the industry’s return of 29.8%, the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's 15.5% gain and the S&P 500's 15.7% rally.\r\n\r\nCompared to its peers, SMCI stock has left incumbents like NetApp NTAP and Pure Storage PSTG behind, with these stocks returning 32.5% and 31.7%, respectively, in the same period.\r\n\r\nSuch rapid gains naturally lead investors to wonder: whether to buy SMCI, or is it time to lock in profits?\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSuper Micro Computer is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. It has been riding on its technology and product leadership in the AI infrastructure market, especially with generative AI training and AI inferencing. Its diversified AI portfolio and strong AI integrations into its storage systems are a plus.\r\n\r\nMoreover, its diversified business model, which encompasses Graphics Processing Units (GPU), AI, core computing, storage, 5G, edge computing and Internet of Things solutions, remains a major positive.\n\nStrong AI Drive Boosts Prospects of SMCI Stock\n\nSuper Micro Computer is experiencing solid traction across top-tier data centers, emerging cloud service providers, enterprise/channel and edge/IoT/telecom customers.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strength in its high-quality, optimized Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) solutions for high-end applications is aiding it in capitalizing on the current AI boom, which is driving the demand for liquid cooling technology.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer remains optimistic about its robust pipeline of new products, as well as existing products. The company’s accelerated innovation of DLC products, a large design win pipeline and a strong backlog position it for solid growth in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nStrong momentum across the company’s H100-based systems and AI inferencing systems is another positive.\r\n\r\nIts offering of Rack-Scale plug-and-play (PnP) solutions powered by the latest DLC liquid cooling technology, which enables customers to achieve the best time-to-deployment, time-to-online and lowest total cost of ownership with their AI applications, remains noteworthy. \r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of its Rack-Scale PnP Total AI solutions, which are contributing well to its server and storage revenues, is a plus. It expects 5,000 racks capacity per month by the end of this year. \r\n\r\nSMCI has also aided the deployment of some of the largest AI SuperClusters in the world.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer is making strong efforts to scale up its production in order to capitalize on AI prospects further and drive its momentum among cloud service providers.\r\n\r\nIt has recently added three new manufacturing facilities in Silicon Valley to support the growth of AI and enterprise rack-scale liquid-cooled solutions and capitalize on the rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, SMCI’s strength in its Datacenter Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) is boosting its presence in the data center market.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid deployment of large-scale AI infrastructure, datacenters worldwide are facing power shortages and cooling inefficiency challenges. DCBBS addresses these issues by reducing datacenter build time from about 3 years to 2 years for new AI-specific centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic Partnerships Drive SMCI’s Growth\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s strategic partnerships with NVIDIA NVDA, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices AMD are playing a vital role in driving its customer momentum.\r\n\r\nSMCI’s robust portfolio of infrastructure solutions for 5G and telecom workloads, on the back of its strong partnership with NVIDIA, remains a major positive. It is also benefiting from strong momentum across the NVIDIA GPU product lines.\r\n\r\nMany Super Micro Computer servers are explicitly designed for high-performance NVIDIA GPUs for AI processing, such as the very high-density 4U-8GPU systems, the Intel CPU-based SYS-421GE-TNHR2-LCC, and the AMD CPU-based AS -4125GS-TNHR2-LCC.\r\n\r\nTo further capitalize on the growing proliferation of AI, Super Micro Computer has deployed NVIDIA HGX H100 SuperCluster solutions to deliver enhanced experience to its customers.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer also offers several products that support Intel’s Sapphire Rapids data center CPU and AMD’s Genoa data center CPU.\r\n\r\nSMCI is now deepening its focus on developing new generative AI and inference-optimized systems based on the next-generation NVIDIA H200, B100, B200, GH200 and GB200 GPUs, as well as Intel’s Gaudi2/3 and Advanced Micro Devices’ MI300X/A GPUs.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer’s strong AI portfolio, along with strategic partnerships, are expected to benefit its long-term prospects. \r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, the company expects net sales of $26-$30 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth between 74% and 101%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $28.01 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 87.5%.\n\nSMCI Offers Attractive Valuation\n\nSMCI stock is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings of 11.87X compared with the industry’s 14.35X and lower than the median of 25.87X, reflecting a good opportunity for the investors.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShipment Delays: A Risk for SMCI\n\nIn the fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, Super Micro Computer suffered from a shortage of some new key components, which delayed shipments that could generate about $800 million in revenues. As a result, the company’s gross margin contracted 580 bps year over year. SMCI’s mounting expenses due to product innovation, marketing and administrative activities led to a contraction of 320 bps in its operating margin.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer still expects shipments to be constrained due to supply-chain bottlenecks for key new components for advanced platforms, which is a major negative. \r\n\r\nThe company is not seeing any significant boost in the shipment of Nvidia's Blackwell GPU until March 2025, which is a severe concern.\r\n\r\nThe company expects gross and operating margins to gradually increase in the current fiscal year, driven by product and customer mix, and manufacturing efficiencies in new DLC AI GPU clusters, and platform introductions. However, the near-term margins are expected to be under pressure due to rising marketing spending and growing investments in manufacturing facilities and research and development.\r\n\r\nAll these are expected to pose a serious impact on the company’s EPS.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $33.50 per share, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 51.6%. The figure has moved south by 0.2% over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion: Hold SMCI Stock for Now\n\nGiven the strong fundamentals, cheap valuation and promising long-term growth prospects in the AI infrastructure market, it would be wise for existing shareholders to hold on to their Super Micro Computer shares. The company is well-positioned to continue delivering robust growth, particularly as the demand for AI remains strong.\r\n\r\nHowever, for new investors looking to buy the stock, it might be prudent to wait for a more attractive entry point. The shipment delays, supply-chain challenges, macro headwinds and falling earnings estimates make the near-term prospects of SMCI foggy.\r\n\r\nSuper Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Index-tracking stock funds with $350 billion in assets are due for a big revamp later this month, after S&P Dow Jones Indices retooled its rules to curb the dominance of the largest companies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nWith the equity market getting increasingly top-heavy in the era of Big Tech, S&P will now reduce the weightings of the market leaders in proportion to their capitalization — in the event they get even bigger and breach size-related thresholds in key industry benchmarks, it said in a statement this week.\n\nIt’s a material departure from the current approach where the smallest of the group gets their weighting trimmed at first, when preset thresholds are triggered.\n\nAt issue is rising concentration risk this year. Investment managers are battling to ensure their exposures to a handful of booming technology companies don’t hit decades-old regulatory limits. But the new rules will have ripple effects far and wide — with the benchmark provider introducing the new capping initiative across its sector indexes tracking everything from consumer staples to energy and communications.\n\nThe incoming rule, adopted after a month-long consultation with market participants, means passive investment vehicles like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) will need to shuffle their holdings accordingly at their next quarterly rebalance.\n\nWhen the changes in the S&P’s capping methodology take effect at the market close on Sept. 20, Piper Sandler & Co. estimates $31 billion of trades will be unleashed across major ETFs, with roughly half of that coming from technology.\n\nThe revision is welcome news for the fund industry, according to Michael Kantrowitz, Piper’s chief investment strategist. The old way to restrain the behemoths has at times left investment funds under-exposed to key names like Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. — and sparked volatile share turnovers earlier this year.\n\nIt “appears to be in attempt to enhance the distribution of weightings more evenly across the indices’ construction while reducing unnecessary turnover,” Kantrowitz said. “This should mitigate some of the issues that led to enormous tracking error,” he added, referring to the performance gap between a capped sector index and its uncapped version.\n\nThe move is the latest among all-powerful index providers to adapt to a concentrated equity market that pushes against regulatory limits. Similar restrictions last year spurred the overseer of the Nasdaq 100 to carry out a special rebalance to keep index-tracking funds in compliance with the rules. Last month, FTSE Russell conducted a consultation about capping the weighting of the largest members of its widely followed US growth and value gauges.\n\nStory continues\n\nCreating headaches for these index overlords are longstanding diversification norms for regulated investment companies that limit any single security to 25% of a portfolio and the aggregate weight of the largest holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%. Established to safeguard investors from over-exposure to too few names, the 25/5/50 restrictions can be punishing in the modern market where companies such as Nvidia and Apple keep getting bigger.\n\nS&P’s capping trigger levels, which are slightly below the 25/5/50 limits to provide a buffer, have stayed the same as 24/4.8/50 this time. The revisions involve how the capping process is executed.\n\nRight now, three stocks each made up at least 4.8% of the uncapped tech gauge: Apple at 23%, Microsoft Corp. at 22% and Nvidia at 19%. With the total surpassing 60%, their weights will be reduced in proportion to their size to meet the 50% limit at the next rebalance. Then the extra weight will be distributed to the index’s other constituents, with a cap at 4.5%.\n\nThe old methodology would require the smallest of the top stocks to get capped first and in that scenario, Nvidia would be cut to 4.5%.\n\nThat’s what happened with XLK in the first half of this year, when Nvidia was surging. As a result, the fund trailed the uncapped tech benchmark by 10 percentage points in the period — the worst underperformance on record.\n\nThen, when Nvidia eclipsed Apple in June, it sparked a rebalance in which XLK bought an estimated $11 billion shares of the chipmaker at the expense of the iPhone manufacturer. Since then, Apple has outperformed, with the fund’s investors missing out on some gains.\n\nUnder S&P’s new rules, however, XLK is set to avoid another round of a big swap like June even as Nvidia has fallen behind Apple in market value.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Mizuho analysts updated their Top Picks List, adding Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to the roster. Other stocks that were added as a part of the September update are Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA), PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp., Terns Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:TERN), and Universal Health (NYSE:UHS) Services.\n\nThe Top Picks List represents a compilation of Mizuho US analysts’ “highest conviction, catalyst-driven ideas.”\n\nFor Micron, one of the important players in the ongoing AI boom that produces memory chips, Mizhuho expects it to benefit from improved pricing in DRAM and NAND, with AI-driven tailwinds supporting the company’s HBM share gains, particularly through its partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe investment bank's analysts project HBM3E to capture around 70% of the HBM market by 2025, with MU continuing to be a key supplier for NVIDIA’s AI GPU ramp, which is likely to drive HBM share growth in the second half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nThe analysts also foresee additional momentum in 2025 as AI device adoption accelerates, estimating that AI PCs and handsets will require double the DRAM and NAND content compared to traditional devices.\n\nWhile acknowledging that a yield issue with MU's HBM has limited margin expansion in the November quarter, analysts anticipate further margin improvements by calendar 2025 as HBM accounts for a larger portion of revenue and utilization rates for traditional DRAM and NAND increase.\n\n\"We believe corrections in most consumer end markets is nearly complete, but demand headwinds remain as refresh cycles for handsets and PCs look extended vs. prior years,” they noted.\n\nAs for Oracle, Mizuho’s team believes Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) is undervalued by investors, emphasizing its competitive pricing, around 33% cheaper than AWS.\n\nThey see strong growth potential as enterprise customers increasingly shift from on-prem to cloud, with Oracle’s large on-prem customer base serving as a future revenue stream. Moreover, Oracle’s industry-specific applications are well-positioned to capture this transition.\n\nThe analysts are also confident in Oracle’s ability to expand its operating margins to 45% by FY26, driven by “cloud margin expansion, sales and R&D efficiencies, and leverage from scale.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMicron, Oracle are new Top Picks at Mizuho\n\nDSV ahead in bidding for Deutsche Bahn's Schenker, sources say\n\nTraders are now pricing in 50% chance of Fed cutting rates by 50 bps in September\n\nView comments",

The firm projected that it would deliver $14 billion in revenue in its fourth quarter, just under estimates of $14.04 billion, according to LSEG data cited by Reuters. The forecast was seen as a sign of possible sluggishness in the company's non-AI-related operations.\n\nOther chip stocks, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and peer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), declined following Broadcom's report. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were also lower ahead of the opening bell.\n\nMobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY) shares fell by more 3%. Bloomberg News earlier reported that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was mulling over options for its holdings in the automated driving systems group.\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) shares surged after the company raised its annual guidance and reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates. Moreover, the software maker increased its share buyback program by $500 million.\n\nSamsara  (NYSE:IOT) shares jumped following better-than-anticipated second-quarter returns from the application software firm. The group also hiked its annual outlook.\n\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings and revenue but its guidance failed to impress investors, sending its shares lower in premarket trading.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBroadcom, Mobileye shares fall premarket; UiPath rises\n\nFutures pare losses after August payrolls data\n\nBuffett's Berkshire continues to dump Bank of America stake\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Semiconductor shares including Nvidia Corp. are in for a rough ride if US jobs data Friday point to a hard landing for the word’s biggest economy, according to strategists at Bank of America Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nA reading below 100,000 together with an unemployment rate of more than 4.4% would trigger a selloff in stocks, sending the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index — which includes Nvidia, Broadcom Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. — to around 4,000, the strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note. That implies a 16% drop from current levels.\n\nConcerns about a potential US recession have weighed on global stock markets recently, and traders will be looking at the August payrolls report for warning signs. Economists estimate an addition of 165,000 jobs and unemployment of 4.2%, according to a Bloomberg survey. But the so-called whisper number for payrolls among Bloomberg terminal users suggests an addition of just 150,000 workers.\n\nIn the hard-landing scenario following the payrolls report, the Federal Reserve would likely respond with a 50-basis-point interest rate cut later this month. That would see 10-year US Treasury yields drop toward 3% from around 3.7% currently, the BofA strategists wrote. The dollar would weaken versus major currencies such as the yen and the euro, and oil prices would plummet to near $60 a barrel, from around $70.\n\nBy contrast, a “perfect” payroll reading of 150,000 to 175,000 would point to a soft landing and trigger a reversal of the recent outperformance of defensive stocks. That would benefit technology and energy shares.\n\nNvidia shares, up 116% year-to-date, have been on a roller-coaster in recent months, acting as a key driver for the S&P 500 Index’s direction of travel. In addition to concerns about economic growth, traders are also worried that the artificial intelligence frenzy that’s driven Nvidia’s gains may be overblown.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

And among the other immediate challenges, the threat of regulation is ramping up.\n\nBut \"near-term headwinds\" is another way of saying \"attractive buying opportunities\" for AI bulls and those analysts who see the light.\n\nThis week’s reported escalation of the DOJ’s probe into Nvidia (NVDA) marked the latest snag in a moment of uncertainty. (The company and others received subpoenas regarding business practices around AI processors.)\n\nWhat is clear from the still-high prices, however, is that Wall Street isn’t debating whether AI technology and its biggest players will usher in game-changing results. That belief has already crystallized. Instead, all the impediments to potential profit have led to mere haggling details over price.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America reiterated their Buy recommendation for Nvidia Wednesday, framing the AI king’s short-term hiccups and hurdles as potential temporary discounts. The stock’s array of difficulties was presented clearly enough, from super chip delays to questions over AI’s massive investment costs to the season’s harsh reputation.\n\nBut what one might perceive as toxic traits could be another’s green flags. The report gave Nvidia a price target of $165, an upside of more than 50% from Thursday’s close. And from the way Nvidia was litigating the nomenclature of its subpoena (\"Civil Investigative Demand\"), we're clearly seeing a bullish company that's saying, \"If you don't accept me at my heightened regulatory scrutiny, you don't deserve me at my ATH.\"\n\nOne of the reasons it’s hard to predict what will come of the Justice Department’s efforts is the multitude of other ongoing cases targeting the tech sector, all with uncertain outcomes, on the edge of a new presidential administration, as well as a history of inaction.\n\nFor Nvidia, antitrust officials are seeking to learn if the company is wielding its market power to keep customers locked into their business. Complicating matters is that some of their buyers have or are developing their own custom chips. And, as analysts point out, Nvidia’s cloud customers have the resources and the sophistication to source AI infrastructure from multiple vendors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America analysts are taking a wait-and-see approach, even as they acknowledge that more government scrutiny into Nvidia’s leading chips position poses a risk. “Until we have more details, we assume no specific material impact on NVDA's fundamental opportunity.”\n\nThis newsletter asked last week if the AI trade was entering a new, diminished phase or if recent troubles were just a blip. It's not hard to see that valuations have fallen. But that's only served as a louder invitation to climb in.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Investment advisory firm Ithaka Group released the “Ithaka US Growth Strategy” second-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter of 2024 saw a surge in optimism among global markets, driven by the anticipation of a looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve and the ongoing development prospects presented by artificial intelligence (AI). This positive outlook increased the S&P 500 by 4.3% for the quarter and 15.3% for the year, the Russell 1000 Growth (“R1000G”) by 8.3% for the quarter and 21.7% for the year, and the Dow decreasing by 1.7% for the quarter and increasing by 3.7% for the year. In the second quarter, the portfolio underperformed and returned 4.2% (gross of fees) compared to the Russell 1000 Growth’s (R1G) 8.3% return. Stock Selection led the portfolio to underperform in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 2.13%, and its shares gained 131.85% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 5, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $107.21 per share with a market capitalization of $2.63 trillion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\n\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Earlier this week, Tesla chief Elon Musk announced that Colossal, an AI training system, had been brought online by his AI startup, xAI. xAI is valued at around $24 billion. The system is powered by 100,000 H100 graphic processing units (GPUs) made by NVIDIA. This AI model is the most powerful ever built. For context, the AI model of Google uses a cluster of 90,000 GPUs while the one at Meta uses 70,000. The H100 GPUs are slowly being replaced by H200, and the rumored Blackwell-based GPUs. Musk has already announced that Colossal would double in size by shifting to H200 GPUs in the coming months.\n\nAmid uncertainty around the production ramp for Blackwell, the H200 GPUs marketed by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are becoming increasingly popular. The H200 comes with 141 gigabytes of HBM3E memory and 4.8 terabytes per second of bandwidth. Musk claims only 50,000 H200 GPUs would double the size of Colossal if the H100 GPUs were replaced. In comparison, the latest Blackwell chips are even faster and more efficient. The top-end capacity of Blackwell GPUs would be 36% higher than the H200 and 66% higher in total bandwidth.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says",
        "content": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nDespite the significant growth and investor interest in artificial intelligence stocks, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday the sector is not in a speculative bubble, unlike previous technology booms such as the late 1990s internet bubble.\n\nYet the analysts highlight the importance of diversification given the high concentration risk among leading tech companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe extraordinary performance of tech stocks in recent years has been justified by their earnings, said Goldman stategist Peter Oppenheimer.\n\nGlobal tech earnings per share have risen by approximately 400% since the global financial crisis, while non-tech sectors achieved a comparatively modest 25% increase, he said.\n\n“The technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to continue to dominate returns,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nTech Valuations Remain Reasonable: Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs highlights a key difference between the AI-driven rally and previous market bubbles.\n\nThe valuations of major tech players are significantly lower than those of tech stocks during past speculative phases.\n\nFor instance, while the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — account for over 30% of the S&P 500's market weight (compared to 19% for tech giants in the 2000s), they trade at nearly half the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seen in the prior dot-com bubble.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($bn) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Apple 7.3 3,387 26.5 7.7 Microsoft 6.6 3,043 25.7 9.4 NVIDIA 5.7 2,649 24.1 13.2 Amazon 4.0 1,850 25.4 2.5 Alphabet 3.9 1,808 16.6 2.0 Meta Platforms 2.4 1,118 19.2 5.5 Tesla 1.4 672 55.4 4.9 Magnificent 7 31.3 14,527 23.9 5.0\n\nIn contrast, tech giants during the 2000s dot-com bubble were trading at much higher multiples. Cisco Systems, for example, had a forward P/E of 101.7, while Intel‘s was 42.1, significantly inflating their valuations relative to the broader market.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($B) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Microsoft 4.5 581 53.2 19.2 Cisco Systems 4.2 543 101.7 17.5 Intel 3.6 465 42.1 N/A Oracle 1.9 245 84.6 N/A IBM 1.7 218 23.5 28 Lucent Technologies 1.6 206 37.9 N/A Nortel Networks 1.5 199 86.4 N/A 2000 Bubble Leaders 19.0 2,457 52.0 N/A\n\nDiversification: Key To Reduce Major Volatility Events\n\nThe Goldman Sachs equity team is flagging the concentration risks that come with this tech dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a few stocks dominate market returns, the potential for “stock-specific mistakes” increases, exposing the broader market to severe corrections, Oppenheimer said. For instance, before the July market correction, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 50% of the S&P 500's total returns for the year.\n\n“A market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation,” he said.\n\nA risk also exists that heightened competition and new entrants into the AI space could compress margins and slow growth for the market leaders.\n\nGoldman Sachs recommends seeking opportunities beyond the tech behemoths, particularly in smaller tech companies and sectors tied to infrastructure spending, which may benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe growth of infrastructure capex could boost old-economy industries that incorporate AI technologies into their operations, the firm said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Could Face Major Swings Under Harris Or Trump Tax Plans, Goldman Sachs Warns\n\nPhoto via Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\n\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been in the spotlight over the past few days after topping analyst expectations on earnings and guidance in the latest quarterly report. This outperformance, coming in the wake of investor concerns around the production ramp for the latest AI chip named Blackwell, outlines the solid demand for non-Blackwell chips that the company markets, the most notable of which is Hopper. Wall Street analysts reiterated their bullish forecasts for the chipmaker following the earnings report, with Daniel Ives from Wedbush leading this charge.\n\nIves hailed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the torch bearer of the AI revolution, with the results and guidance a drop-the-mic moment. Ives, who has been particularly bullish on the company in the past few months, underlined that AI GPU demand was way outstripping supply for NVIDIA at this juncture, and Wall Street should view these results as a very bullish indicator for the broader tech sector with more shock and awe rather than a shrug of the shoulders.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia, whose fortune has risen with the growth of the AI chipmaker but took a hit when its shares plummeted Tuesday. (David Zalubowski / Associated Press)\n\nYou only need to go back three months or so to find the peak of the AI frenzy on Wall Street. That was on June 18, when shares of Nvidia, the Santa Clara company that dominates the market for AI-related hardware, peaked at $136.33.\n\nSince then, shares of the maker the high-grade computer chips that AI laboratories use to power the development of their chatbots and other products have come down by more than 22%.\n\nThat includes a drop of 9.5% Tuesday, which translated into a $279-billion decline in market value, the steepest one-day drop in value of any U.S. stock, ever.\n\nToo much optimism and hype may lead to the premature use of technologies that are not ready for prime time.\n\nDaron Acemoglu, MIT\n\nShed a tear, if you wish, for Nvidia founder and Chief Executive Jenson Huang, whose fortune (on paper) fell by almost $10 billion that day. But pay closer attention to what the market action might be saying about the state of artificial intelligence as a hot technology.\n\nIt's not pretty. Companies that plunged into the AI market for fear of missing out on useful new applications for their businesses have discovered that usefulness is elusive.\n\nThe most pressing questions in AI development, such as how to keep AI chatbots from making up responses to questions they can't answer — \"hallucinating,\" as AI developers call it — haven't been solved despite years of effort.\n\nIndeed, some experts in the field report that the bots are getting dumber with every iteration. Even OpenAI, the leading developer of AI bots, acknowledged last year that on some tasks its GPT-4 chatbot performance is \"worse\" than its predecessors.\n\nAs for the prospect that AI will enable business users to do more with fewer humans in the office or on the factory floor, the technology generates such frequent errors that users may need to add workers just to double-check the bots' output.\n\nOne CEO whose company uses AI to parse what executives promised investment analysts in earlier earnings calls told the Wall Street Journal that it was \"60% right, 40% wrong.\" (The system even got his name wrong.) He didn't say so, but a system that churns out mistakes nearly half the time is plainly worthless.\n\nRead more:Column: Excited about AI and self-driving cars? A top roboticist is here to burst your bubble\n\nBusiness users have reason to be concerned about using AI bots without human oversight. Even on relatively straightforward tasks, such as spitting out a routine legal filing or answering simple customer service inquiries, AI has failed, sometimes spectacularly.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a recent case, a marketing consultant used AI to generate a trailer for Francis Ford Coppola's critically disdained new movie, \"Megalopolis,\" by printing critical pans of his earlier films including \"The Godfather.\"\n\nVariety reported that the bot fabricated negative statements and attached them to the names of critics who had actually appreciated the earlier films. Last year a New Zealand grocery chain's AI recipe bot advised users to combine bleach and ammonia for a thirst-quenching beverage. In fact, the combination is potentially deadly.\n\nThese are tasks on which the current AI models should excel — churned-out boilerplate, advertising copy, customer service information that can be obtained by pressing a button on your touch-tone phone.\n\nThat's because bots are developed by being fed unimaginably large quantities of published works, internet posts, and other mostly generic written material. Developers then apply algorithms that allow the bots to emit responses that resemble human language, but are based on the probabilities that a given word should follow another — one reason that the bot action is often dismissed as \"autocomplete on steroids.\"\n\nThese systems, however, aren't \"intelligent\" in any sense of the term. They produce simulacrums of cogent thought, but often underperform when asked to perform tasks requiring human levels of discernment — for example, in medical diagnosis and treatment.\n\nRead more:Column: AI investors say they'll go broke if they have to pay for copyrighted works. Don't believe it\n\nIn a British study published in July of 1,020 mammogram results assessed by both human experts and an AI system, the humans found 18 breast cancers missed by the AI system, and the AI system found only two missed by the humans. \"By 2024, shouldn't AI/machine learning do better?\" asked Michael Cembalest, the chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, in an analysis of the AI market this month.\n\nOther studies suggest that AI can be helpful in diagnosing medical conditions, but only when used as a technological tool under the supervision of human physicians. Diagnosis and treatment of patients require \"emotional intelligence and moral agency, attributes that AI may be able to mimic but never truly possess,\" bioethicists at Yale and Cornell wrote earlier this month.\n\nOne persistent concern about AI is its potential for misuse for nefarious ends, such as making it easier to shut down an electric grid, melt down the financial system, or produce deepfakes to deceive consumers or voters. That's the topic of SB 1047, a California measure awaiting the signature of Gov. Gavin Newsom (who hasn't said whether he'll approve it).\n\nThe bill mandates safety testing of advanced AI models and the imposition of \"guardrails\" to ensure they can't slip out of the control of their developers or users and can't be employed to create \"biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, as well as weapons with cyber-offensive capabilities.\" It's been endorsed by some AI developers but condemned by others who assert that its constraints will drive AI developers out of California.\n\nRead more:Column: This AI chatbot was 'trained' using my books, but don't blame me for its incredible stupidity\n\nIt's true that some of the contemplated risks seem unlikely in the foreseeable future, its sponsor, state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), says it has been drafted to cover more than distant eventualities.\n\n\"The focus of this bill is how these models are going to be used in the near future,\" Wiener told me. \"The opposition routinely tries to disparage the bill by saying it's all about science-fiction and 'Terminator' risks. But we're focused on very real-world risks that most people can envision and that are not futuristic.\"\n\nThat brings us to doubts not about AI risks, but about its real-world utility for business. These have been spreading in industry as more businesses try to use it, and find that it has been oversold. A survey by Boston Consulting Group found last year, for instance, that \"for business problem solving,\" using the most advanced version of OpenAI's GPT chatbot \"resulted in performance that was 23% lower than that of the control group,\"\n\nAs the consultants noted, \"it isn’t obvious when the new technology is (or is not) a good fit, and the persuasive abilities of the tool make it hard to spot a mismatch. ... Even participants who were warned about the possibility of wrong answers from the tool did not challenge its output.\"\n\nSome investment analysts say that so much has been invested in AI that the big developers such as Microsoft, Meta and Google may not see returns for years, if ever. In coming years, Goldman Sachs analysts reported in June, \"tech giants and beyond are set to spend over $1 trillion on AI ..., with so far little to show for it. So, will this large spend ever pay off?\"\n\nNvidia's dominance of the market for AI hardware raises questions about the impact on the financial markets if the firm stumbles financially or technologically.\n\nJP Morgan's Cembalest titled his analysis of the market's future \"A severe case of COVIDIA.\" AI is \"driving the [venture capital] ecosystem,\" he noted, producing more than 40% of new \"unicorns\" (startups worth $1 billion or more) in the first half of this year and more than 60% of the increases in valuations of venture-backed startups.\n\nThe instability this imposes on investment markets was visible Tuesday, when Nvidia's downdraft helped to bring the Nasdaq composite index down by more than 577 points, or 3.26%.\n\nRead more:Column: Artificial intelligence chatbots are spreading fast, but hype about them is spreading faster\n\nNvidia's decline was fueled by projections of a slowdown in its growth, which up to now has been spectacular, as well as a report that federal regulators had issued the company a subpoena related to antitrust concerns. (Nvidia later denied receiving a subpoena.) The broad market also declined, in part because of signs of a slowdown in U.S. job growth.\n\nOthers also have warned that the AI frenzy has played out or that the technology's potential has been hyped.\n\n\"At the very peak of inflated expectations in finance is generative AI,\" the business technology consultancy Gartner warned last month. \"AI tools have generated enormous publicity for the technology in the last two years, but as finance functions adopt this technology, they may not find it as transformative as expected.”\n\nThat may be true of projected economic gains from AI more broadly. In a recent paper, MIT economist Daron Acemoglu forecast that AI would produce an increase of only about 0.5% in U.S. productivity and an increase of about 1% in gross domestic product over the next 10 years, mere fractions of standard economic projections.\n\nIn an interview for the Goldman Sachs report, Acemoglu observed that the potential social costs of AI seldom are counted by economic prognosticators.\n\n\"Technology that has the potential to provide good information can also provide bad information and be misused,\" he said. \"A trillion dollars of investment in deepfakes would add a trillion dollars to GDP, but I don't think most people would be happy about that or benefit from it. ... Too much optimism and hype may lead to the premature use of technologies that are not ready for prime time.\"\n\nHype remains the defining feature of discussions of the future of AI today, most of it emanating from AI firms such as OpenAI and their corporate sponsors, including Microsoft and Google.\n\nThe vision of a world remade by this seemingly magical technology has attracted investments measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But if it all evaporates in a flash because the vision has proven to be cloudy, that wouldn't be a surprise. It wouldn't be the first time such a thing happened, and surely won't be the last.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia’s CEO would rather ‘torture employees to greatness’ than fire them",
        "content": "Nvidia’s CEO won’t give up on you, which at first might sound nice. But the other foot has seemingly dropped on Nvidia’s employees who are working round the clock because of just how much their executive claims to believe in them.\n\nHuang, the CEO of Nvidia, has recently become a giant in the tech world as his AI chip design company soared to a $3 trillion valuation in June. He doesn’t necessarily usher in a different way of working, though: In a fireside chat with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, Huang praised the value of pushing employees to the brink.\n\n“I’d rather torture you into greatness because I believe in you,” Huang said. While he said he was being \"tongue-in-cheek,\" he added, “I think coaches that really believe in their team torture them into greatness.”\n\nWhen you fire someone, there’s the notion that they can’t learn the job at hand, explained Huang—but he doesn’t really subscribe to that mentality. “I don't like giving up on people because I think they could improve,” he said.\n\nRather than avoiding putting all his eggs in one basket, Huang strays closer to breaking them. Indeed, accounts of a grueling workplace at Nvidia have recently cropped up. Anonymous interviews from a group of 10 current and former staff members paint a picture of an always-on culture, per Bloomberg.\n\nOne such former employee spoke of seven-day workweeks and days that end around 1 or 2 a.m. They noted other staff members would sign off at even later hours. The reported “pressure cooker” has led to some tension at the office. Another former worker said she attended seven to 10 daily meetings, where fighting and shouting were common.\n\nThis workaholic norm is perhaps coming from the top down. When asked in the same fireside talk about his work-life balance, Huang said the following: “It's really great. I work as much as I can,” adding that he works from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed. Huang is always thinking about work, and don’t ask him how he liked the most recent film he watched, because while he might sit there he doesn’t “remember them because I'm thinking about work.”\n\nIt all leads to a situation not unlike being inside with no recess on an exceptionally nice day. Nvidia workers have a pretty sweet deal when it comes to compensation, as they can contribute up to 15% of their salary to buying company shares at a 15% discount. But because of their long hours, there’s not much of a playground to enjoy their riches with.\n\nOne former employee described it as being like being tied to “golden handcuffs,” explaining that she didn't leave for two years because of her wealth-building opportunities. For sure, many workers likely don’t quit because of their vested shares and the potential stock grants vested every four years. Turnover sat at 2.7% in 2023 compared to the general rate of 17.7% in the semiconductor industry, according to Nvidia’s Sustainability Report for 2024’s fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nPart of Huang’s asserted ethos is that he doesn’t want his workers to miss out on their potential. “Oftentimes they're so close,” he noted. “Could you imagine you gave up just that moment right before you got it? I don't want you to give up on that, so I'll just keep torturing you.”\n\nNvidia declined Fortune's request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Which Chip Stock to Buy in a Murky September? NVDA or TSM",
        "content": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) helped Wall Street’s darling semiconductor stock, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, witness a meteoric rise in the last few years. NVIDIA designs specialized chips and outsources the manufacturing to foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, better known as TSMC. So, in a way, these stocks complement each other; they aren’t competitors.\n\nThe TSMC stock has also seen healthy gains so far this year. However, recently, a couple of factors weighed on NVIDIA’s shares. Does this mean the TSMC stock is now more alluring compared to the NVIDIA stock? Let’s have a look –\n\nThe Bullish Case for the NVIDIA Stock\n\nDemand for AI models is here to stay for the long run as they are presently deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. NVIDIA’s chips are needed for AI models, which explains why the semiconductor giants’ H100 graphic cards are the most desirable in the AI chip market.\n\nMoreover, the largely anticipated next-generation Blackwell AI chips would provide NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers since this chip’s infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the present Hopper platform. Simultaneously, NVIDIA’s initiatives to penetrate the gaming market with GeForce and the industrial metaverse space in a tie-up with Siemens is a tailwind for the company.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Jensen Huang also acknowledged that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units to graphic processing units (GPUs). NVIDIA is the global leader in GPUs and its revenues from the data center business soared 154% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nNVIDIA also approved a $50 billion share repurchase plan, a tell-tale sign of a healthy corporate organization (read more: NVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Stock Buyback: Time to Buy?).\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Facing Short-Term Volatility\n\nDespite the positives, the NVIDIA stock is facing bouts of volatility in September. The NVIDIA stock lately notched its worst two-day trading stretch in about two years after the Department of Justice subpoenaed the chipmaker regarding an antitrust investigation.\n\nAnyhow, September is historically the worst month for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA’s shares, on average, declined 2.4% in September compared to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s decline of 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nNVIDIA’s latest promising quarterly results also failed to jack up its share price as it couldn’t keep up with high expectations. After all, the NVIDIA stock has been the best performer on the S&P 500 so far this year (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD or INTC?).\n\nStory continues\n\n2 Reasons to be Bullish on the TSMC Stock\n\nUnlike NVIDIA, the TSMC stock has fared much better in September and there are a couple of reasons to be positive on it. As more companies have started to implement AI features in smartphones, the demand for TSMC’s chips is expected to increase. Apple Inc AAPL is one of the primary clients of TSMC and the launch of iPhone 16 would surely boost demand for TSMC’s chips.\n\nThe ever-growing demand for AI applications would help TSMC’s sales improve in the upcoming years. Notably, demand for AI applications such as Open AI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Gemini have increased substantially in recent times.\n\nAs a result, TSMC’s earnings outlook for the present year looks encouraging, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% year over year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTSMC Stock – A Less Risky Bet\n\nIn early August, NVIDIA’s shares took a beating after major tech players curtailed spending on AI. NVIDIA is heavily dependent on the AI industry and lacks diversification.\n\nOn the contrary, TSMC’s customer base is not limited to the AI industry only. It is spread across the automotive and consumer electronic industries. This diversification insulates the TSMC stock from any industry-specific downturns and provides a steady stream of income.\n\nTSMC Stock – More Pricing Power, Strategic Partnerships\n\nThe TSMC stock accounts for an astounding 90% of high-end chips in the global semiconductor market. This dominance gives the TSMC stock significant pricing power. When NVIDIA fails to meet the soaring demand for AI chips, TSMC can leverage its capacity to charge higher prices and increase profitability.\n\nTSMC, by the way, is the exclusive manufacturer of Apple’s AI chips, and this relationship should certainly lead to higher volume orders, boosting TSMC’s revenues. However, NVIDIA’s total dependency on data center AI chips means that any disruption in the AI industry would impact its business.\n\nTSMC Less Pricey Than NVIDIA\n\nThe TSMC stock is less expensive than NVIDIA, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an upper hand over the semiconductor behemoth. This is because buying TSMC’s shares won’t burn a larger hole in your wallet than the NVDA stock.\n\nAfter all, per the price/earnings ratio, the TSMC stock currently trades at 24.8X forward earnings. However, NVDA’s forward earnings multiple is 39.1X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe TSMC Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist\n\nThe TSMC stock is a better buy than the NVIDIA stock due to reasonable valuations, pricing power, tactical partnerships, diversification, and an inherent ability to exploit the growing demand for AI applications.\n\nWell-known brokers have increased the average short-term price target of the TSMC stock by 27.6% from the company’s last closing price of $160.49. The analysts have set the highest price target at $250, an upside of 55.8%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe TSMC stock, thus, has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). But NVDA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Soaring Demand Boosting Semiconductor Sales: 4 Stocks to Gain",
        "content": "The semiconductor market is trying to stage a comeback after suffering for most of 2023. Higher demand for semiconductors across a large number of industries and the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative, has been boosting sales.\n\nGiven this situation, investing in semiconductor stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, and Semtech Corporation SMTC will be a wise decision.\n\nSemiconductor Stocks to Gain as Sales Soar\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on Tuesday that global semiconductor sales totaled $51.3 billion in July 2024, jumping 18.7% from July 2023’s total of $43.2 billion. Month over month, semiconductor sales rose 2.7% from June’s total of $50.0 billion.\n\nJohn Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, “The global semiconductor market continued to grow substantially on a year-to-year basis in July, and month-to-month sales increased for the fourth consecutive month.”\n\n“The Americas market experienced particularly strong growth in July, with a year-to-year sales increase of 40.1%,” he added.\n\nRegionally, year-over-year sales grew 40.1% in the Americas, 19.5% in China and 16.7% in Asia Pacific/All Other.\n\nCooling Inflation, AI Craze Boost Semiconductor Stock Demand\n\nCooling inflation is finally helping boost semiconductor sales. Easing price pressures have seen demand rebound.  Also, the tech rally this year has largely been driven by NVIDIA Corporation. The semiconductor leader has been at the forefront of the generative AI sector, driving the surge in interest and development in this area.\n\nExperts believe that AI has considerable untapped potential, with much still to be witnessed by the world. This growing interest is likely to boost demand even more as more semiconductor manufacturers are exploring the field. The AI market is expected to explode in the coming days with demand for AI chipsets already surging.\n\nAccording to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”), the semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 16% this year, up from a previous forecast of 13.1%. Global semiconductor sales are projected to reach $611.2 billion this year. Sales in the Americas are expected to lead with an estimated increase of over 25%. Looking ahead to 2025, WSTS expects global sales to grow by 12.5%, reaching $687.4 billion.\n\nAlso, the Federal Reserve is gearing up to start its easing cycle, with the first rate cut likely coming in September. Market participants are anticipating a 25-basis- point rate cut this month. Lower interest rates typically help growth assets as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t provide yields, such as tech and semiconductor stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nSemiconductors Stocks Poised to Grow\n\nWe have chosen four semiconductor stocks that have a strong potential for 2024 and the coming year.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited is the world's largest dedicated integrated circuit foundry. As a foundry, TSM manufactures ICs for its customers based on their proprietary IC designs using its advanced production processes. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s goal is to establish itself as one of the world's leading semiconductor companies by building upon the strengths that have made it the leading IC foundry in the world.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 24.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the past 60 days. TSM presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) saw a slight dip in market share in server instances in July, according to a note from Jefferies on Thursday.\n\nThe report highlights that AMD lost 10 basis points (bps) of share, while Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) made gains, capturing 72.8% of the market, driven by the success of its Sapphire Rapids processors and other offerings.\n\nJefferies pointed out that Intel's Sapphire Rapids processors were particularly strong, contributing to Intel's incremental share gain of 39.1%, up from 18.1% in June.\n\nIn addition, they note that other Intel products also helped boost its market share, with incremental share reaching 15.9% in July, a notable improvement compared to flat performance in June.\n\nOn the other hand, AMD's \"Processor-only incremental share [was] weak vs. INTC,\" said Jefferies.\n\nWhile total processor-only instances grew 0.6% month-over-month, AMD's share only increased by 0.2%, significantly lower than the 2% growth it experienced in June.\n\nAs a result, they state that AMD's total market share dropped slightly from 21.2% in June to 21.1% in July, with particular weakness in its Genoa processors.\n\n\"Genoa incremental share was 1.2% compared to 12.2% in June, similarly its lowest reported data point over the same period,\" adds the firm.\n\nDespite the struggles in processor instances, AMD did manage to gain 10 bps in AI instances alongside AWS. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a decline in Dedicated Accelerator instances, losing 10 bps of market share.\n\nOverall, Intel's momentum, led by Sapphire Rapids, helped it outpace AMD in the server instance market in July, according to Jefferies.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAMD lost some market share in Server Instances while Intel gained- report\n\nExclusive-Vista and Blackstone in talks to acquire software maker Smartsheet, sources say\n\nFrance needs respect and unity, new French prime minister Barnier says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence darling Nvidia Corp. is facing near-term headwinds that are making its valuation look compelling, giving investors an attractive buying opportunity, according to Bank of America Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris\n\nShares of the chipmaker are down about 15% from its late August earnings release, when the company failed to live up to investors’ lofty expectations. The downward pressure could continue in the coming weeks as Nvidia grapples with production issues surrounding its much-awaited Blackwell chips, recent regulatory scrutiny, more cautious investor sentiment toward the AI trade generally, and overall market volatility.\n\nCombined, these could create an “enhanced” buying opportunity for investors, as Nvidia’s stock slips within the lowest quartile of valuation seen in the past five years, wrote BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya.\n\n“The key fundamental recovery catalyst will likely be supply chain data points over the next several weeks, confirming the readiness of new Blackwell product shipments,” the analysts said in their Sept. 4 note.\n\nNvidia shares have been on a rollercoaster ride in recent months, adding and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in market value since a record high in June. That’s moved the broader S&P 500 Index, where Nvidia is the third-largest stock behind Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. So far this year, the stock is the top performer on the S&P 500, up about 115%.\n\nShares of Nvidia rose as much as 3.2% in intraday trading on Thursday, but are set to lose more than 10% overall this week, putting them on track for their worst week since April.\n\nDespite the lack of positive catalysts in the near-term, the stock should be supported over the next few years as companies build out their AI capabilities using Nvidia chips, including the firm’s Blackwell and Hopper lines.\n\n“The tech industry will give itself at least another 1-2 years of intense buildout of NVDA Blackwell chip with its 4x lift in AI training and 25x+ lift in inference,” reads the BofA report. “Efforts thus far with the first wave of large language models (LLM), using NVDA Hopper was just the teaser.”\n\nBofA reiterates that Nvidia is a top sector pick and buy-rated stock. The firm’s $165 price target implies about 55% upside from Wednesday’s close.\n\nWall Street is overwhelmingly positive on shares of the chipmaker. Nvidia has 66 buy ratings, 8 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Bre Bradham and Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "UBS issues shopping list for investors amid tech volatility",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been going through a rout as fears of a US recession sparked a Wall Street sell-off that wiped $279bn of Nvidia (NVDA) alone in one single day. Despite the ongoing volatility, UBS (UBS) is advising investors to see this as a strategic moment to refine their technology portfolios — whether by making selective purchases or offloading certain assets.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, recommends investors assess their portfolio’s technology and AI exposure.\n\nThose with lower AI allocations might consider building exposure through structured strategies to navigate potential volatility, while those with higher allocations could explore capital preservation strategies as a hedge against further market turbulence.\n\n“Semiconductor capital expenditure remains promising,” Haefele noted, though he acknowledged that some areas of the industry are more appealing than others. Nvidia's recent earnings, which exceeded consensus estimates but fell short of loftier expectations, sent mixed signals to investors.\n\nRead more: BP and L&G shares favourite among Fidelity investors as tech appetite fades\n\nHowever, Haefele pointed out that the broader semiconductor sector could find support in the coming quarters due to robust order books and an expected increase in AI-related capital expenditures, which, despite their recent growth, are still below historical peaks.\n\nUBS suggests a targeted approach within the semiconductor space, prioritising AI logic chips where valuations have become more reasonable. Quality foundry stocks also appear attractive, with UBS expecting sustained earnings growth.\n\nAt the other end of the sector, memory chip stocks, which are typically more volatile, may struggle in the current market and face heightened regulatory risks from the US. Chip manufacturing equipment makers, heavily reliant on revenue from China, are seen as the most vulnerable in the near term due to increasing export restrictions.\n\nLooking beyond semiconductors, UBS sees potential in quality large-cap technology companies, particularly those that are beginning to show returns from AI investments. While sentiment around large-cap tech has softened, second-quarter results were solid, and global tech earnings growth is projected to reach 15% to 20% over the next six quarters.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are leading the way in AI monetisation, with Microsoft anticipating faster cloud revenue growth and Meta aligning its investments with substantial monetisation opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Investors buying the dip as Wall Street rout makes stocks cheaper\n\nValuations for mega-cap tech stocks have also become more attractive, currently trading at around 27 times next year’s earnings — approximately 15% below their recent peaks. UBS maintains a preference for quality tech companies with strong secular growth and resilient earnings, supported by solid fundamentals and robust free cash flow.\n\nIn the smartphone sector, supply chains may see a boost from the upcoming replacement cycle. Apple (AAPL), in particular, has shown relative resilience, with its shares holding up well ahead of the seasonal iPhone launch. UBS notes that supply chain checks suggest a launch preparation in line with last year, with the potential for a 5% to 10% increase in orders if demand is strong.\n\nUBS favours companies within the smartphone supply chain that have pricing power and industry leadership while remaining cautious on lower-quality hardware firms that could face margin pressures.\n\nUBS says that tech volatility is likely to persist in the near term but remains confident in the long-term investment case for AI.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Better Stock-Split Buy: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Investors love a good stock split, and here's why. While these maneuvers don't change the value of a company, they do bring down the per-share price of high-flying stocks, making the purchase of full shares more accessible to a broader range of investors.\n\nIn a 10-for-1 stock split of a stock trading for $1,000, for example, you would only have to invest $100 to get a share of the company post-split. The company has more shares selling for a lower price, but its overall market cap has not changed and individual investors still own the same dollar amount of stock. When a company splits its stock, it also shows a certain degree of optimism about the future, with the idea that the stock will once again take off and even potentially return to earlier levels.\n\nStock splits have flourished in recent times, led by major companies across industries. And the tech industry, which accounted for a great deal of stock gains in the first half of the year, has been a big part of the story. Among these companies are two leading artificial intelligence (AI) players, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split in June, and Supermicro recently announced a 10-for-1 split, with the stock to begin trading at its new price as of Oct. 1. Both of these players have soared over the past few years thanks to their dominance in the AI market and make great long-term buys -- but which one is the better buy today? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the global leader in AI chips, holding an 80% share, but it hasn't stopped there. The tech giant has expanded its offerings to include a huge suite of AI products and services, and has reached into new growth areas such as enterprise software and sovereign AI. All of this has helped Nvidia grow revenue and net income in the triple digits quarter after quarter and reach gross margin of more than 70%.\n\nThis isn't likely to end anytime soon as demand for AI is in its early days, with predictions for today's $200 billion market to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade. On top of this, Nvidia is a true innovator, pledging to update its graphics processing units (GPUs) on an annual basis.\n\nAnd right now, we're just weeks away from a key launch. Nvidia plans to ramp production of its new Blackwell architecture and its highest-performing ever GPU in the coming months. The company even predicts billions of dollars in revenue from this platform in the fiscal quarter ending in January. Demand already is surpassing supply -- and the world's top tech companies are Nvidia's biggest customers -- so there's reason to be optimistic about Nvidia holding on to its chip leadership.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for Supermicro\n\nSupermicro benefits from the latest innovations of Nvidia and other top chip designers as well as its own. The company is an equipment maker -- developing everything from workstations to servers -- and includes the latest chips from Nvidia and others in its products. In fact, Supermicro works hand-in-hand with chip leaders so that it can immediately integrate their innovations into its equipment.\n\nAll of this means the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell should boost Supermicro's earnings, too. Supermicro has delivered exceptional growth, five times greater than the industry in the past 12 months, it says,, thanks to its strategy of working closely with chip designers and using a building-blocks technology approach. By building blocks, I mean most of the company's main products include similar parts, making it fast and efficient to tailor a product to a customer's needs.\n\nThis has helped Supermicro's earnings to soar. And now, even more growth may be ahead as Supermicro's direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology solves one of the biggest problems facing data centers: the heat generated by AI projects. Supermicro expects 25% to 30% of new data centers to use DLC in the coming 12 months and that most of this will be provided by Supermicro.\n\nNvidia or Supermicro?\n\nIt's clear that, as long as demand for AI products and services keeps growing, Nvidia and Supermicro will benefit. And the companies both have established solid earnings and share performance track records. The one thing that sets them apart right now is valuation. Nvidia trades for 38 times forward earnings estimates, while Supermicro trades for only 12 times estimates.\n\nEarlier in the year, their valuations were similar -- and at one point Supermicro was even more expensive. Recently, though, two pieces of news have weighed on the equipment maker. Short-seller Hindenburg Research issued a report alleging troubles at Supermicro, and, separately, Supermicro delayed the filing of its 10-K annual report.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 5, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNVIDIA Approves $50 Billion Share Buyback: Time to Buy?\n\nNVIDIA Corp. crushed bubble fears this year and its shares surged more than 100%. However, NVIDIA's stock price recently faced bouts of volatility after tech behemoths trimmed spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the company's latest quarterly results failed to meet high expectations.\n\nBut it's also true that NVIDIA's newest stock buyback plan is expected to please income-oriented investors. So, is this the right time to buy the NVIDIA stock? Let's have a look –\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Share Repurchase Plan\n\nNVIDIA hasn't tampered with its quarterly dividends, but it recently authorized a fresh $50 billion share repurchase. However, stock buybacks aren't new for NVIDIA. The company approved a $25 billion share repurchase in August 2023 and bought back stocks worth around $15.4 billion in the first half of its fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA's board of directors can afford to repurchase shares as the company has generated significant cash flows. NVIDIA's new stock buyback plan is currently the third largest on the S&P 500. Apple Inc. has repurchased shares worth around $91 billion over the past year, while Alphabet Inc. has repurchased some $63 billion in shares, per FactSet.\n\nStock Buyback – A Good Sign for NVIDIA\n\nShare repurchases, in general, are an indication of a healthy corporate organization. This is because share repurchases lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares and an increase in the value of the remaining shares, which is a blessing for shareholders.\n\nNVIDIA's new $50 billion stock buyback and the remaining $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization may be less than 2% of the company's market capitalization. However, this shows that management is optimistic about NVIDIA's future business prospects.\n\nDo share prices go up after a stock buyback? The reduction in the number of outstanding shares often leads to an uptick in share prices. So, it's expected that NVIDIA's shares should increase in the long run.\n\nIt's prudent for investors to ignore NVIDIA's $279 billion market capitalization rout on Tuesday since its shares are not down on isolation. The broader tech sector fell due to discouraging economic data. In reality, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) year to date, signifying a long-term uptrend.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy You Should Stay Bullish on the NVIDIA Stock\n\nBeing the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) bodes well for NVIDIA. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs.\n\nNotably, the global GPU market size is projected to jump from $75.77 billion in 2024 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\n\nNVIDIA's strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares scale upward. MarketsandMarkets stated that the AI industry is estimated to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\n\nLaunch of the cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips later this year would eventually squash any skepticism about NVIDIA. This is because Blackwell is more than just a GPU, its infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform.\n\nNVIDIA's initiatives to enter the ever-growing gaming and industrial metaverse space are also a tailwind for the company. Hence, the $2.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 73.6% from a year ago (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD, or INTC?).\n\nFundamentally, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently. After all, NVIDIA stock's return on equity (ROE) is nearly 120%, while the Semiconductor-General industry's is 73.2%. An ROE above 100% shows that the company's net income is greater than its equity or that the company's performance is very strong.\n\nNVIDIA Stock Is Expensive – Here's How to Trade it\n\nDespite the positives, buying NVIDIA's shares may burn a hole in your wallet. The voracious demand for AI models and supremacy in the GPU market has made the NVIDIA stock pricey.\n\nThis is because, per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 43.2X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 18.2X.\n\nThus, investors should wait for the right entry point and buy on the dip. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should hang on to it since the stock is for the future, as AI is the next big thing in the technology space (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\n\nNVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "One Red Flag for Nvidia Stock That Could Send It Tumbling",
        "content": "When digging through financial statements, it's important to look at the trends for metrics rather than just a single quarter of results. This can lead to a better picture of a company's performance, and I've pinpointed one for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) that investors should watch.\n\nThe trend of this metric is concerning and could cause weakness in the stock.\n\nUnprecedented demand for Nvidia's GPUs has raised profit levels\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become an important piece of computing hardware. Their ability to process multiple calculations in parallel separates them from more conventional computing methods. This also makes them perfect for processes that require intense calculations, like training artificial intelligence (AI) models or running an engineering simulation.\n\nAI has been the primary driver for Nvidia's surge in GPU demand. With major players in AI loading up on its GPUs, the company has been able to charge practically whatever it wants, since its GPUs are seen as second to none.\n\nThis has shown up in its gross profit margin, a figure that conveys how much money is left after the cost of manufacturing the product is accounted for.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia's gross profit margin hovered in the high 50% to low 60% range. But thanks to this new wave in demand and the company's market position, it has spiked to around 75%. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut the second quarter saw a slight decline in gross margin from the first quarter, falling to 75.1% from 78.4%. This fall is expected to continue in the third quarter, with management's projections guiding for 74.4% gross margins.\n\nThis isn't a huge decline, but the trend is noteworthy. Usually, when a company's gross margins fall, it means it has to decrease prices to drive more demand. Obviously, Nvidia doesn't need any more demand. But what the decline could mean is that alternative solutions are gaining steam, and the company is having to tweak its prices slightly.\n\nThis could be a drop in the bucket and have no real meaning over the long term. But if worthy competition does arise and Nvidia's profit margins fall back to historical levels, the stock could be in trouble.\n\nWhat if Nvidia's margins fell to historical levels?\n\nIf Nvidia's margins reverted back to historical levels, it wouldn't be good for the stock.\n\nLet's assume the gross profit margin falls back to normal levels (60%) and its current operating expense level is maintained. That would give Nvidia net income of $12.2 billion (if the second quarter's tax rate is used). That would be a 27% decline from today's levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe expectations that are built into Nvidia's stock are extraordinary: It trades for 55 times trailing earnings and 41 times forward earnings. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nIf you reduce the denominator of the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) by 27%, these figures would rise to 75.6 times trailing earnings and 56.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's even more expensive, and the stock might not command that premium with growth rates starting to slow down due to year-over-year comparisons becoming more difficult.\n\nSo, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock price declined by a similar amount. That's only if I could snap my fingers and see Nvidia's margins instantly decline. In reality, a decline like this would take some time to play out.\n\nI'm not saying that Nvidia's margins will fall back to previous levels. However, investors should consider that the new margin levels are vital to the investment thesis.\n\nIf the gross margin continues to compress and then starts to fall, then the stock will likely follow suit. However, unless Nvidia's competitors (or its current customers) launch a product that can rival its GPUs, its elevated gross margins could be permanent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Biotech Stock Will Outperform Nvidia in the Second Half of the Year",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a tough one to beat when it comes to share-price performance. The technology giant has seen its shares soar 2,500% over the past five years, and this year, it's heading for a 118% increase.\n\nThere's a good reason for this incredible run. Nvidia dominates one of today's biggest growth areas -- the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market -- holding an 80% share. As a result, Nvidia's earnings have been climbing in the triple digits to new records, quarter after quarter.\n\nThough Nvidia makes a great buy, this stock isn't the only potential winner for your portfolio in the second half of 2024. My prediction is that a biotech stock operating in a particularly dynamic field will outperform the tech giant during this period. (It already beat Nvidia's performance in the first half.)\n\nThis biotech has fallen behind over the past six months, but major advancements in its pipeline may give the stock the boost it needs to jump ahead, once again. Read on to find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe billion-dollar obesity drug market\n\nWhich biotech company are we talking about? Viking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX), a player that's making significant progress in the obesity drug market, which Goldman Sachs Research predicts may reach $100 billion by the end of the decade. Viking is developing candidates known as dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, much like the already commercialized drugs of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nThese types of drugs work by acting on hormones involved in the digestion process, controlling blood sugar levels and appetite. They've been immensely popular, leading to shortages in the market and pushing Lilly and Novo Nordisk to expand their production capabilities.\n\nViking's candidates have produced promising data in clinical trials. For example, the phase 2 trial of injectable candidate VK2735 met its primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, with patients achieving as much as a 15% reduction in body weight after 13 weeks. And in the phase 1 trial of the tablet version of the candidate, patients showed as much as 5.3% reduction in weight in just 28 days. The announcement of these results earlier in the year wowed investors, prompting the stock to take off.\n\nIn the second half of 2024, Viking is planning an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for VK2735. Following that, it aims to launch a phase 3 trial. The company also expects to start a phase 2 trial for the oral version later this year. This progression may offer the stock fuel to rocket higher in the coming months.\n\nStory continues\n\nA potential takeover target?\n\nInvestors also have speculated that a bigger biotech or pharma company may consider Viking as a takeover target to get in on the booming weight loss drug market. Further speculation or concrete developments here also could keep Viking stock flying high in the later months of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia could advance, as well, especially considering the company's upcoming launch of its new architecture Blackwell, its most powerful chip ever. But Viking's share performance following pipeline developments has proven to be better than that of Nvidia following good news. When Viking reported positive VK2735 data earlier this year, the stock surged more than 120% in one trading session. Nvidia, after announcing the launch of a stock split -- news investors generally welcome -- climbed about 9% in one session.\n\nAny positive news from Viking could result in outsized gains. With programs advancing in the coming months, more news could be on the horizon.\n\nLong-term investing\n\nOf course, this is just short-term performance. Before buying a stock, it's important to consider its long-term potential because holding on to solid companies for at least five years is the way to truly boost your portfolio.\n\nI expect Eli Lilly to dominate the weight loss drug market, thanks to its position today and candidates in the pipeline. However, considering the great demand in this market, Viking could carve out share down the road -- or potentially join forces with another company.\n\nViking comes with some risk since it's an up-and-coming player and not an established one like Eli Lilly. But it also carries significant growth potential if pipeline programs continue to advance successfully. That's why this stock -- which I predict will beat Nvidia in the second half -- also may score a long-term win for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Stock-Split Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 285%, According to Certain Wall Street Experts",
        "content": "Last week, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) reported solid financial results for the second quarter, but the stock has now tumbled 20% from its high. The drawdown was fueled by concerns about the sustainability of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and the delayed launch of Blackwell, Nvidia's next generation of data center chips.\n\nThat represents a dramatic change in market sentiment for the semiconductor company. Only three months ago, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split alongside phenomenal first-quarter financial results, and that news caused shares to surge 20% during the following week.\n\nBut Nvidia is still on pace to be a $10 trillion company by 2030, according to Beth Kendig, lead technology analyst at the I/O Fund. She remains upbeat about Blackwell and expects an upward revision in the consensus earnings estimate for the next fiscal year. \"Early next year will be fireworks again for Nvidia, and we will be on track for that $10 trillion,\" she told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFormer hedge fund manager and current Mad Money host Jim Cramer came to the same conclusion several years earlier. In 2021, he told CNBC's Halftime Report that Nvidia could eventually be a $10 trillion company, and his conviction has not wavered. \"I stand by my view that you should own Nvidia stock and not trade it,\" Cramer recently told viewers.\n\nNvidia is currently worth $2.6 trillion, so the $10 trillion target set by Kendig and Cramer implies 285% upside for shareholders. Here's what investors should know.\n\nNvidia has a durable competitive advantage in AI chips\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that complete complex calculations orders of magnitude faster than central processing units (CPUs). The company accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and its GPUs accounted for over 80% of AI processors, according to analysts. Nvidia is also the market leader in AI networking equipment, according to Morningstar.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs cutting-edge hardware with proprietary CUDA software. The CUDA platform includes over 400 software libraries (building blocks) that streamline GPU application development across a broad range of disciplines. Nvidia launched CUDA in 2006, and the ecosystem is still expanding. For instance, the company added new libraries for data processing, generative AI, and physics simulations in August.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note, \"We have seen many threats to Nvidia come and go since 2018 -- something like a dozen start-ups, several efforts from merchant competitors such as Intel and AMD, and several custom designs. Most of these have come up short. Competing with Nvidia, a company that spends over $10 billion per year in R&D, is a difficult feat.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackwell GPUs could be the most important product in Nvidia's history\n\nLast week, Nvidia reported excellent financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to $30 billion as demand for AI hardware and software drove strong sales growth in the data center segment. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income surged 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\n\nThe chart below provides segment-specific revenue figures for the second quarter. Infographic detailing second-quarter revenue across Nvidia's four primary business segements.\n\nShown above is second-quarter revenue growth across Nvidia's four primary business segments. OEM & Other revenue has been excluded because it accounted for less than 1% of total revenue.\n\nIn August, The Information published a report alleging that Blackwell GPU shipments would be delayed due to design flaws discovered unusually late in production. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress provided context on the recent earnings call: \"We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nThat means Blackwell will hit the market about three months later than originally quoted by management. But CEO Jensen Huang still believes the platform will be a game changer for the industry. In fact, he recently told analysts, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\"\n\nNvidia stock trades at a reasonable valuation\n\nWall Street analysts expect Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 49% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 48 times adjusted earnings look reasonable.\n\nAs for the $10 trillion target Beth Kendig and Jim Cramer set, I think Nvidia could hit the milestone by 2030. For instance, if we assume the price-to-earnings ratio falls to 25 by the end of the decade, Nvidia would achieve a $10 trillion valuation if earnings increased at 36% annually.\n\nThat is well within the realm of possibility. In fact, spending across AI hardware, software, and services is expected to increase by 36% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. However, investors should not take that outcome for granted.

        "content": "BP (BP.L) and Legal & General (LGEN.L) were the favourite stocks among Fidelity investors in August as they sought to move away from technology funds.\n\nThe past two months have been particularly challenging for AI-related stocks, with concerns over the sustainability of their growth story leading to a rotation out of the highly valued \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) lost $278.9bn (£211.9bn) on Tuesday in the biggest loss of value ever for a US stock as it plunged over 9.5%.\n\nAmid fears over a potential US recession, Fidelity investors are diversifying their investments away from technology funds and into defensive strategies in August, the data showed.\n\nWhen it came to ISA and SIPP investors, shares in BP and Legal & General showed to be the most popular in August. In third place, ISA investors went with Aviva (AV.L) and SIPP clients favoured miner Glencore (GLEN.L).\n\nIn the move away from tech, AlphaWave IP (AWE.L) the only technology stock on the list.\n\n“In August, Fidelity investors demonstrated a shift in their investments, broadening their focus to include a diverse array of sectors such as consumer goods, technology, and industrials,\" Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, said.\n\nRead more: Investors buying the dip as Wall Street rout makes stocks cheaper\n\nCarnival (CCL.L), benefiting from a surge in cruise tourism, also made it into the top 10 for ISA investors in August.\n\nMotorpoint Group (MOTR.L) reflected the strong performance of the used car market despite a decrease in revenues and widened pre-tax losses.\n\nFor SIPP investors, Crest Nicholson (CRST.L), a residential housebuilder, emerged as a new entrant following its rejection of a takeover bid from competitor Bellway (BWY.L).\n\nTech-focused funds, which had dominated Fidelity ISA and SIPP investments for much of the year, saw a decline in investor enthusiasm. The Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P0000XAFS.L), a consistent top-seller, saw reduced interest as investors began to pivot towards safer, more diversified options.\n\nStevenson said: “The tech sector has enjoyed a remarkable run, but August was a rocky period. Nvidia, in particular, has been a key driver of market movements this year. The company, which briefly became the world’s most valuable, saw its market capitalisation drop by around $750bn in July and August, only to recover within a few trading days.”\n\nStevenson noted a \"classic shift towards safety\" as investors sought to preserve capital amid market volatility. This trend has renewed interest in money market funds, with the Royal London Short Term Money Market Fund (0P0000NRQO.L) and the Fidelity Cash Fund (0P00018MM4.L) becoming popular choices among Fidelity's ISA and SIPP investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: UK investors flock to Nvidia and passive funds in August\n\nIn addition to the pullback from tech, there was a noticeable uptick in interest in funds focused on global diversification and emerging markets. The HSBC FTSE All Share World Index Fund (0P00013P6I.L) made its debut in the top ten for ISA investors, reflecting a growing appetite for broader exposure in uncertain economic times. Emerging market funds, such as the Fidelity China Focus Fund (0P0000CO5Z) and the Jupiter India Fund (0P0001JKIB.L), also garnered significant attention, indicating a strategic shift towards regions with growth potential.\n\nDespite the shift away from technology funds, investment trusts with a tech focus remain attractive. The Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT.L) maintained its strong inflows, securing its position as a top choice for the second consecutive month. Allianz Technology Trust (ATT.L) also remained popular among SIPP investors.\n\nGlobal growth continues to be a key theme for Fidelity investors, with the JP Morgan Global Growth & Income Trust (JGGI.L) attracting substantial interest, particularly among ISA investors, for its diversified approach to investing in high-quality companies worldwide.\n\nSIPP investors also showed growing interest in trusts focused on diversification and defensive strategies, with the F&C Investment Trust (FCIT.L), one of the oldest investment trusts, continuing to draw inflows.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has delivered blistering gains since early last year, but it's been a wild ride. After surging 828%, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker shed 27% of its value, though it's now down about 20%.\n\nExpectations were high going into Nvidia's second-quarter financial report. While the results were better than expected, they weren't enough to support the recent run-up. One Wall Street analyst believes the decline represents a compelling opportunity.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald says Nvidia is a buy\n\nIn the wake of Nvidia's financial report, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse reiterated his buy rating and $175 price target on Nvidia stock, which represents potential gains for investors of 62%, compared to Tuesday's closing price. Despite the stock's recent weakness, the analyst called Nvidia's results \"solid.\"\n\nMuse believes concerns about the delayed launch of Blackwell -- the company's next-generation AI architecture -- \"appears to be a nothing burger ahead of one of the biggest and baddest product cycles in Nvidia's history.\" With no change to the AI tailwinds driving Nvidia's growth, Muse believes the current price is \"still too cheap to ignore.\"\n\nThe analyst is clearly on top of his game. During the company's Q2 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said, \"The demand for Blackwell is incredible.\" He believes \"Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry\" because it \"provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center\" than its predecessor, Hopper. Management expects \"several billion dollars\" in Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter before it runs riot next year.\n\nNvidia is guiding for third-quarter revenue growth of roughly 80% year over year after five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, but we knew growth would slow eventually. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade, according to researchers at McKinsey & Company, and Nvidia is at the forefront of this paradigm shift.\n\nNvidia stock is currently selling for 38 times forward earnings.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.’s revenue rose 33% in August, accelerating from the previous month thanks to demand for servers powering AI applications.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\n\nApple Inc.’s main manufacturing partner, also known as Foxconn, reported sales of NT$548.3 billion ($17.1 billion) — a record for the month of August. That pace was up sharply from growth of 22% in July.\n\nFoxconn’s topline has begun to recover from a protracted smartphone slump, helped by a growing business supplying data center operators with servers containing Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerators. Last month, it said it expects revenue to grow over the rest of year, reversing successive quarterly declines. The company’s shares are up close to 70% in 2024.\n\nSome investors preach caution. Nvidia reported earnings that failed to live up to expectations, triggering a record selloff. And analysts have issued fresh warnings that AI’s potential is thus far largely untested and unproven.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nNvidia’s clarification of its scheduled production ramp-up of Blackwell, its next-generation AI GPU platform, in late 2024 helps remove uncertainty over likely growth of the AI server supply chain next year. Despite very limited contribution of the new chips this year, major ODMs such as Hon Hai, Quanta and Wiwynn are set to post triple-digit growth in AI server sales with stellar shipments of systems featuring Hopper chips, Nvidia’s current mainstream platform, in 2H24.\n\n— Steven Tseng and Sean Chen, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nStill, Hon Hai has set itself the goal of securing 40% of the global AI server market, relying on relationships with many of the world’s biggest tech companies and its own manufacturing expertise.\n\nThe Taiwanese company also benefits from consumer electronics demand, and the addition of AI features and enhancements may encourage mobile users to upgrade their devices. Shipments of the iPhone in China have in recent months have bounced back, and the global smartphone market is recovering.

        "content": "By Nick Carey and Marie Mannes\n\n(Reuters) - Volvo Cars will use a single software system backed by powerful chips from Nvidia for all future models and will rely on \"megacastings\" to cut costs for electric cars, the company said on Thursday.\n\nIn releases ahead of a planned investor event in Gothenburg, Volvo said that starting with its flagship electric EX90 model - which the Swedish automaker will begin delivering to customers this month - it will have a single \"technology stack\" for all car models.\n\nThe EX90's software system is backed by Nvidia's DRIVE Orin system-on-a-chip, which is capable of over 250 trillion operations per second (TOPS) and will be replaced later this decade by a chip capable of 1,000 trillion TOPS, Volvo said.\n\nThat software will help Volvo build better safety systems for its cars and constantly improve vehicles in circulation via over-the-air updates, Chief Engineering & Technology Officer Anders Bell told Reuters.\n\nMost major automakers say software-defined electric vehicles (EVs) will provide opportunities to generate billions of dollars in additional revenue from selling subscription services, but Bell said Volvo will not pursue that business model.\n\n\"The primary goal is to make the car better and have a more sticky product, not to sell a lot of subscriptions,\" he said.\n\nBell said Volvo will rely on \"megacastings\", which like gigacasting use massive presses to make large single aluminium pieces of vehicle underbodies.\n\nUsing those large single pieces lowers costs as they replace many individual pieces that need to be welded together.\n\nTesla has been a pioneer in the use of gigacasting, with a growing number of automakers including General Motors and Nissan following suit.\n\nBell said that through the use of megacasting, Volvo will also be able to greatly increase the use of recycled aluminium and reduce emissions throughout its supply chain.\n\n(Reporting by Nick Carey and Marie Mannes; editing by Jason Neely)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Augmented Reality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n\nAR/VR Startups\n\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\n\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that  positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAugmented Reality Market & Outlook\n\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\n\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pokémon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) powers some of the leading AR and VR devices globally. For instance, NVIDIA Cloud RX delivers VR and AR experiences over 5G and Wi-Fi networks, enabling users to stream AR content wirelessly. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also advancing technology to integrate AR into vehicles, with its NVIDIA Drive AR processor collecting data and displaying it to drivers through augmented reality.\n\nCiti reaffirmed its Buy rating and $150 price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the company announced a new service designed to enhance generative AI capabilities for enterprises. The new offering, NVIDIA AI Foundry, in collaboration with NVIDIA NIM inference microservices, leverages Meta's openly available Llama 3.1 models. Additionally, analysts at Fundstrat Global Advisors predicted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s revenue could increase tenfold, potentially reaching $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nIn Q1 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported a remarkable revenue of $26.0 billion, reflecting a 262% increase year-over-year. The company's non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12, up 461% year-over-year. This impressive performance was largely driven by the Data Center segment, which achieved record revenue of $22.6 billion, representing a 23% increase quarter-over-quarter and a 427% increase year-over-year.\n\nIn the second quarter of this year, Insider Monkey's research indicated that 179 out of 912 hedge funds held investments in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Among these, Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was one of the largest shareholders, with a $9.34 billion investment in the company.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn’t immediately evident from NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (“the Index”) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\n\nOur Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious “AI winner” due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

You have new product cycles. You have new introductions of things. And some customers want the existing one faster. Some want to wait for the new one. We have all the above,\" Dell told Yahoo Finance at the Citi TMT conference in New York City on Wednesday.\n\n\"But the macro picture here is very, very clear, and that is that there's enormous demand. It's growing. It's expanding out from the hyperscalers to the service providers to enterprise to commercial to sovereign AI to embedded AI to the edge to retail to manufacturing to your PC to here, there, and everywhere,\" he added.\n\nDell's second quarter underscored why the tech titan's stock has gained an impressive 45% year to date, in part as it's seen as a key player in the build-out of America's AI infrastructure.\n\nThe company said it secured $3.1 billion of AI server sales in the quarter, almost double the $1.7 billion netted in the preceding quarter.\n\nSales in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) surged 38% to $11.65 billion. AI sales are captured in the ISG segment.\n\nDell's Client Solutions Group — which includes sales of PCs and laptops — saw sales drop 4% to $12.41 billion. Consumer sales declined 22% to $1.86 billion, while the commercial business was flat at $10.6 billion.\n\n\"What organizations are seeing is this is a historic opportunity to make their businesses way more productive and efficient, while at the same time, kind of reimagining them given all this capability,\" Dell, who first started the company in 1984, said.\n\nBy and large, the Street remains bullish on Dell's stock due to its AI exposure and because it looks too cheap to ignore.\n\n\"Combining the revenue opportunity [for AI] over the medium-term — which increases visibility into double-digit revenue growth for the core business, and the continued focus on operating expenses, we see a robust earnings growth trajectory [for Dell] which is not fully appreciated in the 13x P/E multiple the shares are trading at currently,\" said JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.\n\nChatterjee reiterated an Overweight rating on Dell shares, the equivalent of a Buy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Demand for AI chips should spur growth for the semiconductor industry over the next few years, the CEO of a major supplier to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said, dismissing concerns that investors had misjudged the pace and extent of spending on artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\n\nWhile the global chip market has grown about 8% annually over the past 20 years, AI semiconductors should grow at a much higher rate going forward, Scientech Corp. Chief Executive Officer Hsu Ming-Chi told Bloomberg Television.\n\n“This booming of the AI industry has just begun,” Hsu said. “For the most prominent company, the equipment we sold to them probably increased two to three times in a year.”\n\nThe CEO’s comments came after Nvidia Corp. reported earnings that failed to meet investors’ loftiest expectations. Analysts also issued fresh warnings that AI’s promise of rewiring global economies is thus far unproven. Nvidia’s shares tumbled 9.5% on Sept. 3, wiping out $278.9 billion in the biggest loss of value ever for a US stock.\n\nStill, Hsu expects his company will see quarterly sales grow sequentially during the second half of 2024. He expressed his confidence in the launch of many AI applications in the future.\n\nTaipei-based Scientech makes equipment used in TSMC’s exclusive packaging technology, called Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate. That’s in turn employed to make AI chips for the likes of Nvidia. In May, TSMC Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang said his company makes 99% of the world’s AI accelerators.

        "title": "Here’s why Nvidia’s aggressive sales tactics are in the DOJ’s crosshairs",
        "content": "Investors’ favorite AI play, Nvidia, has been on thin ice in recent weeks. Concerns about its rich valuation, new pressure from antitrust regulators, the sustainability of the AI boom, and the impact of the slowing U.S. economy have spooked even some of the chipmaker's most ardent defenders.\n\nNvidia stock has dropped roughly 18% since Aug. 19, with the majority of the damage coming after a 9.5% plunge on Tuesday that erased a record $279 billion in market cap.\n\nJust after the dark day of trading for Nvidia, Bloomberg reported that the U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) has ramped up its antitrust probe against the company. DOJ officials reportedly sent a subpoena to Nvidia, and other involved companies, which includes “legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information,” according to unnamed Bloomberg sources familiar with the matter. Subpoenas often precede the filing of a formal complaint against a company under investigation.\n\nDOJ officials have expressed concern that Nvidia makes it difficult for its customers to switch to new suppliers and penalizes those that don’t exclusively use its AI chips, according to Bloomberg’s sources. The DOJ investigation into Nvidia began in July, The Information first reported, after similar allegations from competitors about Nvidia’s pricing strategies.\n\nIn a statement to Fortune, Nvidia said that it “wins on merit” and customers are free to choose whatever solution works best for them, adding that the company “scrupulously” adheres to all laws.\n\n“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed. Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business,” a representative added.\n\nStill, the tech world’s issues with Nvidia’s tactics certainly seem to be widespread.\n\n\"All of Nvidia's competitors have issued grievances with me. I'm not going to name them, but you can imagine who they might be,\" Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analyst and advisory firm, told Fortune.\n\n“Nvidia's customers haven't talked about any of these tactics, but they have talked about the desire to have—what words did they use—a more ‘balanced supply chain,’” he added.\n\nNvidia's April acquisition of RunAI, which provides AI computation software, is also under the DOJ’s microscope, per Bloomberg’s report. There are concerns that the purchase will further strengthen Nvidia's grip on the entire AI chip supply chain, making it more challenging for its customers to switch to competitor’s products.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, Moorhead believes this could end up being “a very serious probe” for Nvidia, which could slow its business slightly, force the company to open up some of its software platform for use by competitors, or, eventually, lead to a significant fine.\n\n“The reason I say that is first of all, technically, Nvidia is a monopoly. Second, AI is super important to society, economics and business today and into the future. So it's a super hot button [issue]. And that means regulators are super motivated to do something,” he warned.\n\nSo, is Nvidia a monopoly?\n\nNvidia controls roughly 90% of the AI-critical next-generation chip market, and it has made big steps toward vertical integration in recent years, branding itself as not just a chip company but an \"AI platform enterprise.”\n\nThe impressive market share gains and suite of both software and hardware AI offerings have made Nvidia a monopoly in the view of many experts, but the DOJ will have to prove more than just that.\n\n“It's not illegal to be a monopoly. It's illegal—if you're a monopoly—to squash competition and harm consumers,” Moorhead noted.\n\nTying agreements, where a seller ties the sale of one product to the purchase of another, are one of the ways Nvidia is allegedly abusing its monopoly power. These agreements, also called “tie-in” sales, are not always illegal, but can be challenged under four provisions of antitrust laws, according to the DOJ.\n\nBoth section one and section two of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which prohibit the “restraint of trade” and make it illegal to “monopolize,” can be used to challenge tying agreements. Similarly, the DOJ could rely on section three of the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act, which forbids acts that will \"substantially lessen competition,” or section five of the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits “unfair competition.”\n\nJim Keller, CEO of the AI chipmaker Tenstorrent, an Nvidia competitor, told The Information in August that Nvidia’s sales tactics are not illegal, in his view, but he admitted customers often “feel pressured to buy Nvidia’s networking gear to guarantee themselves access to the company’s vaunted AI server chips.”\n\nWhile the DOJ is investigating claims of tying agreements, they will likely have to prove that the tying was done with official contracts, rather than merely “pressure.”\n\nBut that may be difficult to do, according to Scott Bickley, practice lead and principal research director at Info-Tech Research Group, a tech research and advisory firm. He noted that semiconductors have always been dished out on allocation schedules, with contracts both parties agree to in advance, and Nvidia isn’t being accused of breaching any contracts.\n\n“Of course, they're going to try to sell their gear—which they will probably say is more compatible, that you'll get a better quality experience if you run Nvidia chips with Nvidia racks and things like that. But to my understanding, and from what I'm hearing, they haven't forced that. They're heavily encouraging it, but they're allowing their biggest customers to utilize their own gear and their own hardware for their data center designs,” he explained.\n\nBickley argued that the tying agreement beef is largely a jockeying match for pricing between Nvidia and its very influential and powerful big tech clients in a space with little to no serious competition.\n\n“I don't think Nvidia's doing anything—that I can see, at least on the surface—that would be breaking the law,” he said. “I think they've just become the 800 pound gorilla in a space where there's not any other 800 pound gorillas to fight them off at this point.”\n\nThe potential use of exclusionary rebates is likely another reason the DOJ could be investigating Nvidia for antitrust violations. “[Those say] I'm only going to give you this good price if you don't buy the competition. It's not volume-based pricing, it's exclusionary-based pricing,” Moorhead explained, noting “you can't do that if you're a monopoly.”\n\nNvidia’s software platform CUDA might also be under the microscope. CUDA is used in everything from low level drivers to generative AI models, and it isn’t open to competitors like AMD or Intel to use.\n\n“Now, if you're not a monopoly, that's fine. If you have monopolist powers, people might look at that and say, well, ‘You're more in the marketplace business, right?” Moorhead said, explaining that: “In that case, you have so much power you have to open this up, even if it's your competitors.”\n\nStill, Bickley argued that Nvidia is simply utilizing its technology advantage to increase profits and gain market share, rather than engaging in anti-competitive behavior. Attempting to fine, break up, or slow Nvidia would only impede the development of AI in his view.\n\n“What we need is some good, old fashioned innovation,” Bickley argued. “You know, have some other companies come out with competing products and technologies that start to siphon away some of that investment from Nvidia.”\n\nThe potential impacts of a DOJ investigation on Nvidia\n\nNvidia could face significant challenges if a DOJ investigation finds antitrust violations, experts say. But even if there aren’t any violations, the chipmaker’s business operations could be slowed, at least slightly, by the investigation.\n\n“When anybody has the Department of Justice looking at them, it slows things down,” Moorhead explained, likening it to putting small bits of sand in a gas tank. “You have to have a lawyer approve your allocations. You have to have a lawyer approve your pricing. You have to have a lawyer—in meetings that you normally wouldn't have a lawyer in.”\n\nNvidia could also be forced to open up its CUDA software platform to competitors in a worst-case scenario, leading to increased competition. “Apple had to open up the app store, and Microsoft had to open up its API with Internet Explorer, this would likely be something like that, which would enable AMD, Intel, and others…to tap into CUDA on an equal basis,” Moorhead explained.\n\nIf the DOJ is able to prove Nvidia acted illegally, it may need to pay heavy fines as well, and not just in the U.S. “I do believe that this case is going to spread to the EU, Korea, Japan and likely Taiwan—probably not China—which, again, just makes the scrutiny even higher. But essentially, it's paying a fine,” Moorhead said.\n\nHowever, neither Moorhead nor Bickley believe these fines will dramatically impact Nvidia’s business, in large part due to the company's distinct technology advantage and surging revenues. Both experts also noted that it will take months, or more likely years, for the DOJ’s investigation to conclude.\n\n“By the time it comes to a conclusion, whatever that conclusion is, the money will have been made by Nvidia, so any fine that they put forward will be basically pocket change,” Bickley said. “I don't think it will have any material impact at all on them and their and their earnings and their financial position.”\n\nBickley doesn’t see the DOJ’s case as likely to succeed, either, despite investors’ negative reaction to news of the investigation. “I don't really see a path for them to come up with any type of true anti-competitive judgment,” he said. “I don't think it's going to come up much.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have been two of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Nvidia is the world's largest producer of high-end data center GPUs for processing machine learning and AI tasks. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a rapidly growing supplier of dedicated AI servers. Most of those systems are powered by Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nOver the past two years, Nvidia's stock surged more than 640% as Supermicro's stock rallied nearly 550%. Both stocks soared as the rapid expansion of the generative AI market drove more companies to upgrade their data centers with new AI chips and servers. But should investors chase either of these high-flying AI stocks right now? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is still firing on all cylinders\n\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue from gaming GPUs for PCs. But the rapid expansion of the AI market turned its data center unit, which accounted for 87% of its top line in its latest quarter, into its largest and fastest-growing business.\n\nThat's why Nvidia's revenue surged 126% in fiscal 2024, which ended in January 2024, and 171% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2025. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow 123% and 137%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nThose growth rates are incredible, but Nvidia still faces some unpredictable challenges. It controlled 98% of the data center GPU market last year, according to TechInsights, but it faces stiff competition from AMD's cheaper GPUs. Nvidia has also been struggling to ramp up its production of its latest Blackwell GPUs, and several of its top AI customers -- including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Alphabet's Google -- have been developing their own first-party AI accelerator chips.\n\nNvidia's red-hot data center chip sales are also gradually cooling off. Its 16% sequential sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 actually marked a deceleration from its 23% growth in the first quarter and 27% growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Its yield issues with Blackwell also reduced its gross margin sequentially in the second quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow 41% in fiscal 2026. Its stock doesn't look that pricey at 44 times forward earnings, but it might shed its premium valuation if companies start to scrutinize and rein in their AI spending.\n\nSupermicro faces some major challenges\n\nSupermicro is an underdog in the server market, but it carved out a niche by producing high-performance liquid-cooled servers. That made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which provided it with a steady supply of GPUs for its high-end AI servers.\n\nSupermicro's revenue rose 37% in fiscal 2023, which ended last June, and surged 110% in fiscal 2024. Its soaring sales of AI servers, which now account for over half of its top line, offset its slower sales of traditional servers. Bank of America expects the company to expand its share of the AI server market from 10% to 17% over the next three years.\n\nBut in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Supermicro's gross margin shrank sequentially and year over year as it grappled with supply chain issues, ramped up its spending on new liquid-cooling technologies, and faced more pricing pressure from Dell Technologies and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in the AI server market.\n\nOn Aug. 27, prolific short seller Hindenburg Research accused Supermicro of stuffing its sales channels with partial orders of defective products and inflating its revenues. It also said Supermicro hadn't resolved all of the accounting issues that previously caused its stock to be delisted from the Nasdaq in 2018. A day later, Supermicro postponed its 10-K filing for fiscal 2024 and said it needed \"additional time\" to assess its \"internal controls over financial reporting.\"\n\nAnalysts still expect Supermicro's revenue and earnings to grow 90% and 58%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 as it ramps up its shipments of AI servers. For fiscal 2026, they expect its revenue and earnings to rise 19% and 30%, respectively. Those growth rates seem impressive for a stock that trades at just 13 times forward earnings, but its recent problems could drive away the bulls and compress its valuations for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe better buy: Nvidia\n\nNvidia remains the linchpin of the booming AI market, and its market dominance still gives it plenty of pricing power. We can't say the same about Supermicro, which is a lot smaller than Dell and HPE. Supermicro's delayed 10-K filing could also contain some nasty surprises that provide more fuel for Hindenburg's bearish thesis against the company. I once thought Supermicro had a shot at outperforming Nvidia this year, but its shrinking gross margin, Hindenburg's allegations, and its postponed 10-K filing raise too many red flags. That's why I'd stick with Nvidia instead of Supermicro as my top AI play.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\n\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug​.\n\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon’s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company’s total sales​. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure​. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company recently reported its second-quarter 2024 earnings, surpassing market expectations with earnings per share beating estimates by $0.04 and revenue exceeding forecasts by $1.3 billion. Additionally, the guidance for the third fiscal quarter also came in above expectations. During the earnings call, concerns about the production ramp-up of Blackwell, the company's latest AI chips, were addressed. The CFO disclosed that customer samples of the Blackwell architecture were shipped in the second quarter, with full-scale production scheduled to start in the fourth quarter and continue through fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in an appearance on news platform CNBC after the earnings call, said that the company expected to earn billions of dollars in revenue from volume production of Blackwell chips in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. Huang also underlined that hyperscalers only represented 45% of the total data center revenue of his company, emphasizing that NVIDIA was well diversified in this area, with customers ranging from internet service providers, sovereign AI firms, to industries and enterprises.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "ETFs in Focus Amid September's Market Storm Possibilities",
        "content": "September could further increase market volatility. Often termed as Wall Street’s worst month, September has been challenging for traders. According to Yahoo Finance, for the past 98 years, September is the only month in the calendar to have averaged a negative return.\n\nThis calls for a more cautious approach, with investors turning to defensive funds to navigate the downturn. Investors are closely monitoring the upcoming U.S. jobs reports and unfavorable data could trigger market overreactions, leading to panic selling and plummeting stocks.\n\nPotential surprises from a tight U.S. presidential race and the Fed’s upcoming meeting add further uncertainty to the market, emphasizing the need for increased exposure to defensive funds. If the Fed deviates from the dovishness, which has already been priced in by the markets, significant volatility can be triggered.\n\nIncreased Market Vulnerability on Heavy Tech Reliance\n\nHeavily tech-reliant portfolios are exposed to the risks of high valuations and concentrated rallies in select names, leaving them vulnerable to significant drawdowns if the AI-driven market bubble bursts. Increasing exposures to defensive funds becomes a smart strategy then.\n\nHigh market expectations make it challenging for leading tech giants to deliver earnings that meet investor demands, as recently demonstrated by NVIDIA. Despite recording impressive growth in second-quarter 2024, NVIDIA’s earnings failed to meet the high expectations that had fueled its recent rally, resulting in its shares falling 6.4% on Aug. 29, 2024.\n\nEver since the tech giant released its results, NVDA shares have fallen about 14% (as of Sept. 3). According to Yahoo Finance, NVIDIA’s record sell-off has resulted in about $279 billion being wiped off from the market by investors.\n\nManufacturing Numbers Heighten September Stress\n\nOn the decline for most of the past two years, U.S. manufacturing contracted once more in the month of August, worse than what economists had earlier forecasted. Marking the third consecutive month of contraction, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index increased to 47.2% in August compared to the forecasted 47.9%, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nAll signs indicate that market turbulence is likely to continue, with the current sell-off potentially not being the last one. Investors are expected to tread cautiously as the manufacturing data likely points toward a cooling U.S. economy.\n\nETFs to Consider\n\nBelow, we highlight a few ETF areas that investors could use to navigate the uncertain environment in a better way to protect themselves from the potential headwinds in the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in these sectors not only shields investor portfolios from downside risks and safeguards investments during market distress but also offers gains when the broader market trends upward. These sectors provide dual benefits, protecting portfolios during market downturns and offering gains when the market trends upward.\n\nAlternatively, investors can seize the opportunity to buy the dip and invest in growth funds to capitalize on potential future economic upswings. Investors can consider funds like Vanguard Growth ETF VUG, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF and iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF IVW.\n\nQuality ETFs\n\nAmid market uncertainty, quality investing emerges as a strategic response as a potential buffer against the potential headwinds. This approach prioritizes identifying firms with robust fundamentals, consistent earnings and lasting competitive strengths. Investing in such high-quality companies can mitigate volatility for investors.\n\nInvestors can look at funds like iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF QUAL, Invesco S&P 500Quality ETF SPHQ, JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF JQUA and SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF QUS.\n\nConsumer Staples ETFs\n\nThe potential slowdown in the economy could benefit consumer staple stocks, as these companies manufacture everyday necessities such as food, beverages and household items. Additionally, surging household debt levels could burn a significant hole in consumers’ pockets and prove to be a positive for these funds.\n\nInvestors can consider funds like Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP, VanguardConsumer Staples ETF VDC, iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF IYK and Fidelity MSCI ConsumerStaples Index ETF FSTA.\n\nHealthcare ETFs\n\nThe healthcare sector is non-cyclical, providing a defensive tilt to the portfolio amid market turmoil. Further, the long-term fundamentals remain strong, given encouraging industry trends.\n\nFunds like Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV, Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT, iShares U.S.Healthcare ETF IYH andFidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF FHLC.\n\nUtility ETFs\n\nBeing a low-beta sector, utility is relatively protected from large swings (ups and downs) in the stock market and is, thus, considered a defensive investment or a safe haven amid economic turmoil.\n\nInvestors can consider Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund XLU, Vanguard Utilities ETF VPU, iSharesU.S. Utilities ETF IDU and Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF FUTY.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia shares keep falling. Should you buy the dip?",
        "content": "The rise of Nvidia has been synonymous with Wall Street’s AI-boom, but Tuesday’s market sell-off hit the dominant chip maker’s stock the hardest. Nvidia shed $279 billion in market cap, the biggest ever drop for an American company in a single day, before shares fell slightly further on Wednesday.\n\nAs Warren Buffett once said, it can pay “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”  Do investors now have a rare opportunity to buy the dip for shares of a fast-growing company that accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500’s total returns during the first half of the year?\n\nEven after the plunge, Nvidia’s stock is still up 115% year-to-date. Analysts, though, have made clear investors should not expect shares—which closed just above the $106 mark Wednesday, down from an all-time high of $140.76 in June—to continue appreciating at the same pace. It is also common wisdom that revenue growth will inevitably decelerate given the eye-popping growth of previous quarters.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nTo get an idea of why Nvidia's growth is poised to slow, consider its data center business, which has been the company’s main revenue driver. Revenue from those operations hit a record $26.3 billion this past quarter, up 154% from a year ago. Nonetheless, it was a far cry from the unit’s 427% revenue bump last quarter.\n\nThe company is running into the law of large numbers, Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview with Fortune before last week’s Q2 earnings release. He urged caution to his clients heading into the call.\n\n“But that said, listen, I mean, when you look at the valuation of this company, it's trading at a big discount to where it actually historically trades at,” he said.\n\nThat message was echoed by Bank of America analysts, a group led by Vivek Arya, even after Nvidia beat expectations in its latest earnings. Arya and his team raised their price target on the stock from $150 to $165. Zino and CFRA maintained its buy rating on the stock, standing pat with a price target of $139 for the year.\n\nAs of Tuesday close, Nvidia was trading around 68 times its diluted EPS, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. That’s down from a P/E ratio of 180 last September.\n\nThe biggest long-term concern for Nvidia, Zino noted, is what happens when demand, which currently far outstrips supply, begins to dry up. In a tweet Wednesday morning, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said he believed Nvidia’s stock was significantly hurt by a note from Michael Cembalest, the chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Cembalest raised doubts about whether tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta will earn adequate returns after spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI-investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's not a market-wide sell-off at all. It is a sell-off of anything having to do with AI/data center/computing as well as housing and oil and some companies leveraged to infrastructure\n\n— Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) September 4, 2024\n\nIn the long haul, Zino believes the answer is yes.\n\n“Because that's the kind of shift, the permanent shift we're going to see,” Zino said. “There are just going to be a lot more AI-enabled devices out there, a lot more connected devices out there. And because of that, you're going to need a lot more data centers in the future.”\n\nIf so, investors who buy Nvidia now might not completely miss the boat.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., responding to a Bloomberg News report about the US Department of Justice sending out subpoenas as part of an antitrust probe, said it has been in contact with the government agency but hasn’t been subpoenaed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\n\nThe DOJ often sends requests for information in the form of what’s known as a civil investigative demand, which is commonly referred to as a subpoena. The Department of Justice has sent such a request seeking information about Nvidia’s acquisition of RunAI and aspects of its chip business, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn its response to the story, Nvidia said that its edge in the AI computing market stems from the superiority of its products.\n\n“Nvidia wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” the company said in a statement, adding, “We have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed. Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”\n\nIn the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ’s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, people familiar with the matter said. A representative for the DOJ declined to comment.\n\nAntitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don’t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nRegulators have been investigating the purchase of RunAI, a transaction announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.\n\nNvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it’s eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp.\n\n(Updates with more on probe starting in fifth paragraph.)\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show La justicia no viene al caso en las cortes de inmigración de EE.UU.

        "content": "Investing.com -- As the curtain closes on a \"generally good\" quarterly earnings season for corporate America, Barclays warns of an uncertain road for earnings in the coming quarter, paved with an ongoing slowdown in big tech earnings and macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n\"3Q24 EPS has been revised down nearly -5% since May and Y/Y growth is expected to fall by more than half vs. this reporting season,\" Barclays analysts noted, flagging the potential challenges ahead.\n\nThe gloomy outlook for the current quarter earnings pales in comparison to Q2 2024, which saw earnings per share growth reaching 11.7%, the highest in over two years, with about 81.2% of S&P 500 companies beating EPS estimates.\n\nBut while the Q2 earnings mostly beat expectations, the surprise factor, or the margin of the beat was \"modest,\" the analysts note, knocking the aggregate surprise 4.1% below the long-term average.\n\nThe small surprise factor during this season was set before the earnings season officially got underway as a number of companies reported negative revisions leading up to the earnings reports.\n\nFinancials were the biggest winner, with \"the highest EPS surprise in 3 years, 83% of the sector beating consensus and forward estimates moving higher,\" Barclays said.\n\nBig tech also left its mark on the earnings season -- and not in a good way. Big Tech EPS growth, which led earnings growth over the past two years, suffered a second-straight quarter of decelerating earnings growth and is \"also expected to continue decelerating next quarter,\" the analysts said.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the touchpaper for the AI trade, was particularly noteworthy after posting its weakest EPS surprise of 5.4% in the last seven quarters, along with \"modest\" sales guidance, they added.\n\nEarnings growth isn't expected to get any help on the macroeconomic front, the analysts believe, as uncertainty about whether the whether a soft landing or recession beckons continues to weigh.\n\n\"Further-out estimates [beyond 3Q24] are largely untouched; we think this is reflective of growing macro uncertainty,\" they added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStorm clouds gathering for Q3 earnings amid macro headwinds, and tech slowdown\n\nMarathon's Detroit refinery union workers go on strike\n\nMajor book publishers defeat Internet Archive appeal over digital scanning\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Have $20,000? These AI Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) last year led to a rally in the tech market. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has climbed 81% since the start of 2023, driven primarily by excitement over AI. While the bull run has benefited current investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones, as the stocks of many of the world's leading tech giants are trading at a premium.\n\nIt can be difficult to figure out when a stock is a good buy, but investors can start by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and comparing it to the P/E of competitors. The ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share, and lower is considered better.\n\nAI superstar Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) P/E sits at 56. With Advanced Micro Devices' P/E at 181 and Intel's at 96, Nvidia looks like a bargain. Meanwhile, Nvidia keeps succeeding with its majority market share in AI chips, and its stock looks like a no-brainer way to invest in AI right now.\n\nAnd Nvidia isn't the only compelling option. So, have $20,000 that you don't need for anything in the short or medium term? Here are two AI stocks that look like bargain buys in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia ($108 per share)\n\nAccording to research group BIS research, the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market saw spending of about $15 billion last year and will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 32% until at least 2028 -- hitting $62 billion. GPUs are a crucial growth area in AI, with the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, fierce competition between various AI software giants means companies will require the latest and most powerful chips to keep up with their rivals, creating instant demand for newly released GPUs.\n\nNvidia has enjoyed this demand firsthand, with an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs.\n\nThe company posted its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 28. Revenue increased 122% year over year, beating Wall Street expectations by just over $1 billion. Meanwhile, earnings per share came in $0.04 higher than analysts had forecast. The quarter benefited from consistent growth in AI GPU sales, with revenue in its data center segment popping 154%.\n\nFurthermore, the chart below shows that Nvidia's earnings could reach nearly $5.00 per share in two fiscal years. If the stock's P/E stays near where it is, that would mean a much higher stock price in two years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\n2. Alphabet ($158 per share)\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has delivered impressive gains over the years, with its stock up 178% since 2019. Alphabet's operating income and free cash flow have climbed 135% and 96% over the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nPopular services like YouTube, Google, Android, and Chrome have made Alphabet an invaluable resource to consumers and businesses worldwide. These platforms attract billions of users daily, providing the company with a lucrative tool for building a highly profitable digital advertising business. And now, the company has a similar opportunity in AI.\n\nAdvertising has spurred the company's growth in recent years; in the most recent quarter, advertising accounted for nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue. The tech giant's investment in AI is also promising as it employs an expansion strategy similar to what it used to succeed in advertising. Over the last year, the company has integrated AI into many of its services, using the technology, for example, to better track viewing trends on YouTube and recommend videos, create a more responsive Google Search, and add a range of generative AI features to Android.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has even ventured into AI hardware with its recently revealed Google Pixel 9 smartphone, likely to give Apple's coming iPhone 16 a run for its money with its advanced generative features.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, Alphabet stock is a bargain compared to its rivals when viewed on a P/E basis. The company's P/E of 23 is a low on this list. An investment in Alphabet could offer big gains over the long term.

        "content": "Investors are lining up to buy the dip as fears over the risks of a US recession have knocked mega cap stocks, making them cheaper and more attractive to buy.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled more than 9% through Tuesday’s session in the biggest one-day market capitalisation drop in US history, amid a broader pullback in semiconductor stocks. Nvidia lost $270bn (£205bn) in a single day, sparking a wave of selling in chip stocks.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘’Fresh worries about the health of the global economy have gripped markets, with the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) far from immune given the international leaning of the index. London-listed stocks are set for another downbeat session, after deep concerns rippled out from Wall Street over the risks of an American recession.\"\n\nDutch chip firm ASML (ASML) was down more than 6% on Wednesday and AMD (AMD) plunged over 7%.\n\nHowever, as some traders are selling stocks to cut losses, others are seeing an opportunity to buy at a discount amid market panic.\n\nJung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management in Singapore, told Bloomberg: “Although we expect the volatility spike to revisit more often for some time in the future, we maintain our view that each selloff is a buying opportunity. In this regard, we expect to see the broad equity market in Asia rising very quickly, once again.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks slump as Wall Street market rout spooks investors\n\n“The concern for peak in demand for AI is exaggerated in our view. We will likely see the demand for AI as well as its supporting infrastructure remaining robust throughout the first half of next year.”\n\nHowever, not everyone is confident about buying the dip, fearing that it could turn into catching a falling knife.\n\n\"Investors appear wary of buying the dip, ahead of this week’s US employment data, which culminates on Friday with the latest non-farm payroll release,\" David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said.\n\nStill, there are also a number of catalysts ahead that should prompt share prices to bounce back, as central bankers are expected to deliver on rate cuts. The US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England are all set to announce their policy decisions later this month.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell has said the “time has come” for the Fed to cut rates.\n\nRead more: UK investors flock to Nvidia and passive funds in August\n\nIn the UK, investors sought to take advantage of the dip in August, figures from Calastone showed.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquity fund inflows fell to £535m in August, a 75% drop compared to the previous month and the lowest level since November 2023, the latest fund flow index by Calastone revealed.\n\nA panic sell-off on 5 August rocked the funds industry as investors pulled £206m out of the market, then bought the dip in the next five days, adding net £592m to equity funds during that period.\n\nWhen markets bounced back later in August, some investors chose to take profits with outflows in the second half of the month.\n\n\"Investors flinched when global markets convulsed in early August,\" said Edward Glyn, head of global markets at Calastone. \"Outflows turned to inflows as markets calmed and sellers melted away, but nerves have clearly been rattled.\"\n\nGlobal stocks were hit by heavy selling early in August on weak US economic data and a surprise Bank of Japan rate hike, causing a Black Monday in Tokyo.\n\nMarket rout was felt across most equity fund sectors, with inflows down by just over a third (-35%) for global equity funds to £639m, by half (-50%) for North American equity funds to £564m, and by just under three fifths (-58%) for European funds to £155m and similarly for emerging market funds (-59%) to £174m.\n\nMeanwhile, Asia-Pacific funds suffered a sixteenth consecutive month of outflows, which almost quadrupled (+260%) month-on-month to -£184m.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its “Alger Spectra Fund” second quarter 2024 investor letter. In 2024’s second quarter, U.S. stocks were positive, with the S&P 500 rising 4.28%. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Materials and Industrials sectors underperformed compared to the S&P 500 Index, while the Information Technology and Communication Services sectors outperformed. There was a notable return gap in the second quarter, where large-cap growth stocks saw meaningful gains, while smaller-cap and particularly value stocks lagged. Against this backdrop, the fund outperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 9.19%, and its shares gained 129.49% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 3, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $108.00 per share with a market capitalization of $2.649 trillion.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. Simply put, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter results driven by strong demand from data centers. Additionally, management noted that large cloud service providers, contributing approximately 45% of data center sales, recognize the high return on investment offered by Nvidia’s computing solutions, which are driving AI spending. The company also introduced its next-generation H200 chip, which nearly doubles the inference performance compared to the H100 chip, enhancing how trained AI models process new data. Lastly, management raised their fiscal second quarter guidance, noting that demand for their current H100 chips remains strong, and that demand for their next generation products is estimated to outstrip supply over the next year. We continue to believe the company is well positioned to potentially benefit from the growing AI data center workloads, which are driving demand for the increased interconnections and fully accelerated software stacks, thereby enabling leading application performance and fast result times.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 179 hedge fund portfolios held NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the end of the second quarter which was 186 in the previous quarter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported another record quarter in Q2 with $30 billion in revenues, representing a 122% year-over-year increase and 15% sequential growth.  While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nIn another article, we discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and shared list of stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices: Billionaires Are Selling Them and Scooping Up Shares of 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, investors have pretty much always had a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend to captivate their attention. However, no addressable market has seemingly loomed larger since the arrival of the internet than the current rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhat makes AI so special is the ability for software and systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. This means AI-driven software and systems can become more proficient at assigned tasks, as well as grow to learn new skills. On paper, this gives artificial intelligence utility in almost every sector and industry around the globe. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe massive addressable market associated with AI -- an estimated $15.7 trillion lift to the global economy by 2030, according to the analysts at PwC -- isn't lost on Wall Street's top investment minds. However, quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that billionaire money managers have mixed feelings about the most-popular AI stocks.\n\nIn the June-ended quarter, more than a half-dozen billionaire investors were active sellers of the \"brains\" behind AI-accelerated data centers. But interestingly enough, numerous billionaire asset managers were avid buyers of two other key AI players that have announced or completed a stock split this year.\n\nData-center hardware kingpins Nvidia and AMD were shown to the door\n\nAlthough enterprise demand for the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power generative AI solutions, train large language models, and oversee split-second decision-making for AI-driven software and systems, has been off the charts, billionaires haven't been afraid to ring the register and take profits on the two most-prominent AI-GPU developers: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nThe June-ended quarter marked the third consecutive quarter that more than a half-dozen billionaires were sellers of Nvidia's stock. The seven well-known sellers in the latest quarter include (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nBy some combination of fate and coincidence, AMD also had seven billionaire money managers that sent its shares to the chopping block in the second quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (5,716,366 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,952,088 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,649,937 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (977,904 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (536,689 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (502,688 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (260,000 shares)\n\nWhile profit-taking is certainly one reason we've likely witnessed notable selling in Nvidia and AMD from billionaires, historic precedent might be an even bigger catalyst.\n\nFor 30 years, numerous can't-miss technologies, innovations, and trends have come and gone, and not a one has avoided an early innings bubble-bursting event. Investors have a tendency to become wide-eyed with the potential for game-changing technologies, and almost always overlook that it takes time for new innovations to mature and be adopted by consumers and/or businesses.\n\nThe simple fact that most companies lack a well-defined game plan for their AI investments is a clear signal that AI euphoria has likely overshot the technology's current utility.\n\nCompetitive pressures are another reason billionaire investors might be headed for the exit with Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia can't keep up with enterprise demand for its H100 GPU and is liable to lose valuable data center \"real estate\" with its top four customers (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") developing in-house AI-GPUs. While AMD can chip away at Nvidia's monopoly like AI-GPU market share with its substantially cheaper MI300X AI-GPU, the end result of both companies ramping production is less AI-GPU scarcity and, over time, weaker pricing power.\n\nThough billionaires were decisive sellers of the brains behind high-compute data centers, they were clear-cut buyers of two other AI stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMore than a half-dozen billionaires piled into Broadcom\n\nWhile prominent billionaires were busy dumping shares of Nvidia and AMD during the second quarter, there were piling into AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), which completed a 10-for-1 forward-stock split in July. To somewhat keep with the theme, a total of seven billionaire investors were buyers of Broadcom stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (2,347,500 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,096,440 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,880,740 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (865,090 shares)\n\nBroadcom made its grand entrance into the AI space with the release of the Jericho3-AI fabric in April 2023. Jericho3 is capable of connecting up to 32,000 GPUs, with a purpose of reducing tail latency and helping businesses maximize the computing capacity of their GPUs.\n\nBut in spite of the clear boost Broadcom has received from artificial intelligence, billionaires might be even more impressed with its operating diversity. For instance, it's one of the leading providers of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies continuing to expand the reach of 5G have lifted demand for Broadcom's smartphone solutions.\n\nBroadcom has also leaned on acquisitions as a way to expand its ecosystem of products and services and promote cross-selling opportunities. This includes buying information technology management software and solutions provider CA Technologies, gobbling up cybersecurity company Symantec, and paying $69 billion for cloud-based virtualization software provider VMware. The latter will help Broadcom meet the private- and hybrid-cloud needs of businesses.\n\nHaving true revenue diversity means that Broadcom would almost certainly fare better than Nvidia and AMD if the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests it will.\n\nSix billionaire money managers scooped up shares of Super Micro Computer\n\nThe other high-flying AI stock-split stock that had billionaires mashing the buy button in the June-ended quarter is rack server and storage solutions provider Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Six billionaires opened a position or added to their existing stakes in Super Micro, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (553,323 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (508,814 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (98,752 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (45,066 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (15,777 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,040 shares)\n\nOn Aug. 6, when Super Micro lifted the hood on its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results, its board announced the approval of a 10-for-1 stock split, which will take effect after the close of trading on Sept. 30.\n\nWhile investors have been placing a lot of emphasis on the GPUs that make AI-driven software and systems tick, Super Micro Computer is reminding Wall Street just how important AI infrastructure is for enterprise data centers. The company's customizable rack servers, which incorporate Nvidia's leading H100 GPU, have been in high demand, as evidenced by the 110% sales growth Super Micro recorded in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). The midpoint of Super Micro's sales guidance -- $28 billion -- for fiscal 2025 implies nearly triple-digit year-over-year sales growth.\n\nThe downside for Super Micro Computer is that it's heavily tied to Nvidia's fortune. Supply constraints have made it impossible for Nvidia to meet all of its customer's demands, which means Super Micro likely isn't reaching its potential.\n\nMoreover, we've been here before with Super Micro. This is a company that soared during the initial enterprise cloud-computing boom, only to have orders fail to meet Wall Street's lofty expectations not long thereafter. If AI needs time to mature as a technology, Super Micro's stock could give back most of its gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has joined a $100 million-plus funding round for Tokyo startup Sakana AI, one of the larger investments the US chipmaker has made so far in Japan’s fledgling artificial intelligence arena.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat\n\nSakana, founded in 2023 by a pair of former Google engineers, secured the Series A or early-stage financing led by New Enterprise Associates, Khosla Ventures and Lux Capital. The startup said it will team up with Nvidia on research, data center access and “AI community-building” locally.\n\nSakana — which means “fish” in Japanese — sets out to train low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. Its team unveiled several AI models for Japanese speakers this year, demonstrating how quickly domestic companies can ramp up their capabilities in the sphere.\n\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he was drawn in particular to Sakana’s endeavors in Japan to popularize AI. His company, which makes the accelerator chips that drive the global development of generative AI, has since 2023 stepped up its pace of startup investment.\n\n“Countries are embracing sovereign AI to capture and codify their data, culture and language through their own unique large language models,” Huang said in a statement. “The team at Sakana AI is helping spur the democratization of AI in Japan.”\n\nThe Asian nation is beginning to draw global attention as an AI market. Microsoft Corp. is investing $2.9 billion over two years to build out the country’s data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, while OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman just opened a Tokyo office. Microsoft is also partnering with SoftBank Corp. on generative AI, while OpenAI is working with Rakuten Group Inc.\n\nPreviously valued at around $200 million, Sakana’s approach contrasts with those of industry leader OpenAI and others spending billions of dollars training AI on huge datasets. Sakana says its algorithms can help automate the creation of AI models that process language or images by mimicking natural selection when they combine, test and discard data, reducing the amount of human input required.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show Private Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Need 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "content": "Broadcom (AVGO) Reports Earnings Tomorrow: What To Expect\n\nFabless chip and software maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after market close. Here’s what to expect.\n\nBroadcom beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 4% last quarter, reporting revenues of $12.49 billion, up 43% year on year. It was a decent quarter for the company, with a meaningful improvement in its inventory levels. Looking ahead, its full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance topped Wall Street's estimates.\n\nIs Broadcom a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Broadcom’s revenue to grow 46% year on year to $12.96 billion, improving from the 4.9% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.20 per share. Broadcom Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Broadcom has a history of exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 1% on average.\n\nLooking at Broadcom’s peers in the processors and graphics chips segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Nvidia delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 122%, beating analysts’ expectations by 4.5%, and Qorvo reported revenues up 36.2%, topping estimates by 4.1%. Nvidia traded down 6.4% following the results while Qorvo’s stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of Nvidia’s results here and Qorvo’s results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the processors and graphics chips segment, with share prices up 4.7% on average over the last month. Broadcom is up 6.7% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $192.4 (compared to the current share price of $153.5).\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chip shares dragged Asian indexes lower on Wednesday and European futures fell after growth concerns drove the steepest selloff in a month on Wall Street and investors wiped $279 billion from the value of market darling chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nOil hit year-to-date lows in Asia trade, the safe-haven yen rose, Japanese stocks fell more than 3% and the regional shares ex-Japan dropped nearly 2%. [MKTS/GLOB]\n\nHere are analyst and investor comments on market moves:\n\nNICK FERRES, CIO, VANTAGE POINT ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE\n\n\"The ISM manufacturing index poured cold water on the benign growth outlook.\n\n\"Although equities have responded enthusiastically to the dovish rate outlook ... a range of key leading indicators suggest that macro conditions appear likely to deteriorate more sharply looking forward. In that context, the S&P 500 valuation multiple, equity and credit premium offer insufficient compensation for risk.\n\n\"We fear another drawdown phase over the coming weeks.\"\n\nJUN BEI LIU, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TRIBECA, SYDNEY\n\n\"People are taking a bit of profit off.\n\n\"There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the equity market. If anything, things are actually looking pretty good. You've got 25 basis point cuts to start and quite a few to follow and the economy is slowing but not collapsing.\n\n\"The next few months will probably see the bottom of earnings and for investors, in the next few months is where you deploy into a lot of those opportunities.\"\n\nSTEVEN LEUNG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL SALES, UOB KAY HIAN, HONG KONG\n\n\"Hong Kong is pretty weak, so whenever we see a negative signal like that from the U.S., Hong Kong will be performing even worse.\n\n\"People are thinking the current situation is different to the one in August, due to the unwind of the yen carry trade. This time, it's not because of that, it's more because of the U.S. economy. It's more scary, because it's not a technical reason, it's a more fundamental issue.\"\n\nJASON TEH, CIO, VERTIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT, SYDNEY\n\n\"The question is how fast the economy slows down while the Fed cuts rates because if they are behind the curve, then the markets will continue to sell off. It's that tightrope right now and the market is trying to figure it out.\n\n\"When you look at Nvidia as a market leader, it's not holding up despite very strong profits. There's an old saying - if the troops can't follow the generals it's a warning sign ... if the Nvidias and Apples and Microsofts cannot hold up the market, that's it we're in a bear market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMICHAEL ARONE, SPDR CHIEF STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON\n\n\"What I expect is that we’ll see a continued rotation away from technology stocks leading the way to broader leadership. That’s happening because interest rates and inflation are both falling and that should help to close the gap in earnings growth between the technology sector and the rest of the market.\"\n\nSAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA, NEW YORK\n\n\"I think investors just succumbed to seasonality ahead of what they fear will be a double dose of declines in an election year in both September and October, and they piled on to those stocks that had lots of profits booked.\n\n\"This may be a short week but it will be an important and crucial week one for investor confidence; people are going to remain on edge.\"\n\nSTEVE SOSNICK, MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, GREENWICH, CT\n\n\"There’s a bit of a post-Nvidia earnings hangover going on today. Those earnings last week were fine; they exceeded expectations. But the magnitude of the beats is shrinking quarter by quarter and that’s not lost on investors.\n\n\"There’s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality. That’s why the VIX is higher. I don’t think the ISM number, showing a weaker manufacturing sector but higher prices, was at all helpful. And there you have it. Gravity.\"\n\nMICHAEL GREEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIMPLIFY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA\n\n\"People are over-allocated to Nvidia and many of these names and they’re trying to reduce that exposure. It just has the potential for these things to sell off quite significantly.\"\n\n(Reporting by Reuters bureaux in New York and Asia; Compiled by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Asian stocks decline, following Wall Street's drop on worries about the economy",
        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Asian stocks tumbled Wednesday after Wall Street had its worst day since early August, with the heavyweight Nvidia falling 9.5%, leading to a global decline in chip-related stocks.\n\nJapan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 3.8% to 37,211.09, leading losses in Asia. Electronics and semiconductor company Tokyo Electron slumped 7% in morning trading. South Korea’s Kospi was down 3.0% to 2,584.81, with tech giant Samsung Electronics dropping 3.1%. Taiwan’s Taiex lost 4.0%, dragged down by the heavyweight Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which was 4.7% lower.\n\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.1% to 7,933.40 after Wednesday data showed the country’s GDP grew by 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023, slightly above experts’ forecast. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined 1.1% to 17,462.25 and the Shanghai Composite index shed 0.5% to 2,789.39.\n\nU.S. futures were lower. Rising oil supply was driving down prices, as Libya moved closer to resolving a conflict over control of the country’s oil revenue that meant its oil production may soon increase.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude fell 45 cents to $69.89 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 42 cents to $73.33 a barrel.\n\nGrowing worries about China's economy — the world’s largest importer of crude oil — also amplified doubts about future oil demand, especially after the recent release of weak data, which was dragged down by a real estate slump and weak consumption.\n\nThe S&P 500’s heaviest weight, Nvidia, fell 9.5% on Tuesday. Its stock has been struggling even after the chip company topped high expectations for its latest profit report. The subdued performance could bolster criticism that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks simply soared too high in Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Global semiconductor-related stocks declined on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 sank 2.1% to give back a chunk of the gains from a three-week winning streak that had carried it to the cusp of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 626 points, or 1.5%, from its own record set on Friday before Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.3% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks led the way lower.\n\nTreasury yields also stumbled in the bond market after a report showed U.S. manufacturing shrank again in August, sputtering under the weight of high interest rates. Manufacturing has been contracting for most of the past two years, and its performance for August was worse than economists expected.\n\n“Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty,” said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing business survey committee.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther reports due later this week could show how much help the economy needs, including updates on the number of job openings U.S. employers were advertising at the end of July and how much U.S. services businesses grew last month. The week’s highlight will likely arrive on Friday, when a report will show how many jobs U.S. employers created during August.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 119.47 points to 5,528.93. The Dow dropped 626.15 to 40,936.93, and the Nasdaq composite sank 577.33 to 17,136.30.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.84% from 3.91% late Friday. That’s down from 4.70% in late April, a significant move for the bond market.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar was nearly unchanged at 145.48 Japanese yen. The euro cost $1.1054, up from $1.1043.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n\nView comments",

We will likely see the demand for AI as well as its supporting infrastructure remaining robust throughout the first half of next year.”\n\nInvestors should “look for stocks that have not enjoyed the rally despite its connection with AI” such as Samsung Electronics Co., Yun added.\n\nAndrew Jackson, a strategist at Ortus Advisors Pte. in Singapore\n\n“It feels a bit like a storm in a tea cup after August. It feels like we are not getting a repeat of the intense panic selling like last time,” he said. Jackson added that he would buy Micronics Japan Co. and Advantest. on declines as they have little to no exposure to China.\n\nCharu Chanana, head of FX strategy at Saxo Markets in Singapore\n\n“The September curse comes together with memories of an early August selloff that came on the back of jobs report. And we have another jobs report coming this week, so traders are taking risk off the table for now,” she said.\n\n“I would be rather cautious here,” she added.\n\nRandy Abrams, head of Taiwan research at UBS Global Asset Management in Taipei\n\n“Now investors are starting to question if the ROI is coming through. They are a bit nervous when they see some of the macro data is not as strong. So there is a question whether the music keeps playing, whether the cloud investment is still there.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSoft data points are driving skittishness in AI stocks, but “the reality we see from supply chain and the hyperscalers is that they will continue to spend,” and that’s why investors bought the dip a few weeks ago, he said.\n\nAn Hyungjin, chief executive officer at Billionfold Asset Management Inc. in Seoul\n\n“It doesn’t seem to be an opportunity to dip buy tech stocks,” An said. “Because South Korean industries are dependent on the US economy, worries about its economic slowdown cannot but touch off market jitters.”\n\nInvestors should find relative safety in the Korean companies that depend on domestic demand than those relying on US exports.\n\nDayeon Hong, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Shinhan Asset Management Co. in Seoul\n\n“Stock markets have rebounded quickly after declining sharply in August so what we see today is partly a reversal of that rebound,” she said. “As the market volatility could increase on Friday, investors are preemptively moving to defensive positions.”\n\nKohei Onishi, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo\n\n“Today’s fall is just a reaction to big drop in New York shares overnight. Given that the US market had been rising, the decline of this size is not a surprise,” he said. “We have lots of events in the run-up to the FOMC on Sept 17-18 and markets will likely be range-bound this month. But once uncertainties around those events are cleared, we are likely to see a rally in share prices toward the end of year.”\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Annabelle Droulers and Hideyuki Sano.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show Private Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Need 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian semiconductor-related stocks tumbled, putting regional benchmarks on course for their worst drops in a month amid renewed concerns of overheating in the artificial intelligence rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat A Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell as much as 2.2%, the most since the Aug. 5 panic selloff. Taiwan’s Taiex tumbled as much as 5.3% while Japan’s Topix slid 3.4% and Korea’s Kospi dropped 3%. The declines came after leading global AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. shed a daily record of $278.9 billion in market value Tuesday.\n\nThe latest concerns were sparked by analyst comments that AI stocks had gotten too far ahead of what the technology can actually deliver in terms of profits. The risk-off mood was further stoked by worry over the US economy after a closely watched US manufacturing gauge missed estimates.\n\n“Now investors are starting to question if the return on investment is coming through,” Randy Abrams, head of Taiwan research at UBS Global Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “They are a bit nervous as some of the macro data is not as strong.”\n\nDespite rising volatility, most investors cautioned against taking Wednesday’s slide as the start of another market meltdown, recommending dip-buying of selected names, as AI spending is expected to remain strong.\n\n“It feels a bit like a storm in a tea cup after August,” said Andrew Jackson, a strategist at Ortus Advisors Pte. “It feels like we are not getting a repeat of the intense panic selling like last time.”\n\nChip stocks were the biggest drags on MSCI’s broadest Asian equity gauge Wednesday. Among key Nvidia suppliers, foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. slid as much as 5.5%. Japanese testing-equipment maker Advantest Corp. plunged as much as 10%, while Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. tumbled 9.2%.\n\nMore broadly, investors are monitoring conflicting cues to kick off September, a historically volatile month for stocks. While China’s economic funk continues to weigh on sentiment, there are also expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in its upcoming meeting, providing a boost for equities.\n\nSome also maintain optimism on the promise of AI, with companies around the world still planning to spend billions as they incorporate the new technology.\n\n“The concern for a peak in demand for AI is exaggerated in our view,” said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global Pte. “We will likely see demand for AI and its supporting infrastructure remaining robust through the first half of next year.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, valuations are seen as somewhat less of an issue in Asia, where AI stocks have lagged the gains in some of the biggest global names. A Bloomberg gauge of Asian chipmakers is trading at about 13 times forward estimated earnings, down from over 18 times earlier this year and trailing the nearly 24 times level of an index of major US-listed peers.\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi and Annabelle Droulers.\n\n(Updates with more comments in fifth and sixth paragraphs.

        "title": "Stocks Hit by Biggest Selloff Since August Crash: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks posted their worst day since the Aug. 5 market meltdown, with the S&P 500 falling more than 2%, as growth and monetary anxieties combined to torch risky assets much as they did a month earlier.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office A Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\n\nJust as in the August episode, tech got hit the hardest, with Nvidia Corp. driving a plunge in chipmakers. And the parallels don’t stop there. The yen jumped, a closely watched manufacturing gauge again missed forecasts, and oil plummeted on concern about tepid global demand. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - the VIX - soared. Treasury yields tumbled, with traders keeping their bets on an unusually large half-point Federal Reserve rate cut this year.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 saw their worst starts to a September since 2015 and 2002, respectively. With inflation expectations anchored, attention has shifted to the health of the economy as signs of weakness could speed up policy easing. While rate cuts tend to bode well for equities, that’s not usually the case when the Fed is rushing to prevent a recession.\n\nTraders are anticipating the Fed will reduce rates by more than two full percentage points over the next 12 months — the steepest drop outside of a downturn since the 1980s. The trepidation after the latest rise in unemployment will leave traders “on edge” until Friday’s payrolls data, said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n“This week’s jobs report, while not the sole determinant, will likely be a key factor in the Fed’s decision between a 25 or 50 basis-point cut,” said Jason Pride and Michael Reynolds at Glenmede. “Even modest signals in this week’s jobs report could be a key decision point as to whether the Fed takes a more cautious or aggressive approach.”\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped to around 5,530. The Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 each lost over 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%. The $22 billion VanEck Semiconductor ETF saw its biggest plunge since March 2020. Nvidia tumbled 9.5%, erasing $279 billion in a record one-day wipeout for a US stock. The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws.\n\nUS 10-year yields fell seven basis points to 3.84%. A record number of blue-chip firms tapped the corporate-bond market, taking advantage of cheaper borrowing. The yen climbed as Bank of Japan’s Kazuo Ueda reiterated the central bank will continue to raise rates if the economy and prices perform as expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Morgan Stanley strategist who foresaw last month’s market correction says firms that have lagged the rally in US stocks could get a boost if Friday’s jobs data provide evidence of a resilient economy. A stronger-than-expected payrolls number would likely give investors “greater confidence that growth risks have subsided,” Michael Wilson wrote.\n\nThe equity-market rally may stall near record highs even if the Fed starts a highly anticipated rate-cutting cycle, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said earlier this week. The team led by Mislav Matejka noted that any policy easing would be in response to slowing growth, making it a “reactive” reduction.”\n\n“We are not out of the woods yet,” Matejka wrote in a note, reiterating his preference for defensive sectors against the backdrop of a pullback in bond yields. “Sentiment and positioning indicators look far from attractive, political and geopolitical uncertainty is elevated, and seasonals are more challenging again in September.”\n\nSeptember has been the biggest percentage loser for the S&P 500 since 1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. A contrarian sentiment gauge from Bank of America Corp. rose to its highest level in nearly two and a half years last month — creeping closer to a “sell” signal for US stocks.\n\nTo Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management, aside from the macro picture, there’s also the fact that we’re entering what’s often a “miserable time” of the year for equities.\n\n“While history isn’t gospel, it’s not crazy to think that this September could be especially volatile,” Cox noted. “But this isn’t the conclusion to draw from decades of seasonal market data. Instead, your attention should be on why this is a “buyable dip, because there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic here.”\n\nAmong those, she cited: earnings growth, the Fed about to start easing policy against the backdrop of controlled inflation and the fact that investors are sitting on a massive pile of cash “that could make its way back into stocks.”\n\n“A key lesson from the last few weeks is that big-tech stocks have not proven defensive during the recent market pullbacks,” said Philip Straehl at Morningstar Wealth. “While there is little evidence of a slowdown in AI spending, valuations have set a high bar for incoming corporate and macro data.”\n\nRich Ross at Evercore says the S&P 500 has had at least a 5% drawdown from the August/September highs in nine of the last 10 years.\n\n“This year should be no different after the late August squeeze into resistance at an all-time high,” Ross noted. “The S&P has a strong downside bias buttressed only by a bent towards ‘low volatility’ defensives and financials — which benefit from lower rates and steeper curves.”\n\nAs investors navigate through the historically weak September, Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise remarked the October-December period is the S&P 500’s strongest three-month stretch.\n\n“In our view, investors should remain focused on using volatility to their advantage,” Saglimbene said. “Importantly, lean on time-tested dollar-cost averaging strategies and portfolio diversification to weather a potentially bumpier push into year end.”\n\nMarking the start of a busy week for economic data, a report showed US manufacturing activity shrank in August for a fifth month.\n\nThis coming Friday, the August jobs report is expected to show payrolls in the world’s largest economy increased by about 165,000, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.\n\nWhile above the modest 114,000 gain in July, average payrolls growth over the most recent three months would ease to a little more than 150,000 — the smallest since the start of 2021. The jobless rate probably edged down in August, to 4.2% from 4.3%.\n\nWhile the Fed is finally coming around to cutting rates, it does not feel like stringing out a bunch of 25 basis-point rate cuts will do the job, said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. Under that scenario, it will take a long time to return the funds rate to neutral and in the process, you’ll keep policy restrictive, keeping open downside risks to growth.\n\n“That muddling through scenario will probably risk further increases in the unemployment rate. So, if they aren’t going 50 in September, they are going to need to go 50 at some point later this year,” he concluded.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nBoeing Co. slumped as Wells Fargo & Co. lowered the planemaker to a sell-equivalent recommendation, saying it’s hard to see any upside in the shares. Vice President Kamala Harris joined President Joe Biden in declaring that United States Steel Corp. should remain domestically owned and operated, the latest headwind to the proposed sale of the company to Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp. Deutsche Bank AG cut the recommendation on JPMorgan Chase & Co. to hold from buy, while upgrading Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. on changing preferences within the banks sector.

        "content": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nWorld markets will open on an extremely shaky footing on Wednesday after a gloomy snapshot of U.S. factory activity on Tuesday reignited fears about the U.S. economy's 'soft landing' and slammed stocks, oil prices and bond yields sharply lower.\n\nIt was the first trading day of September for U.S. markets after the Labor Day holiday weekend, and for those who put greater store in 'seasonal' factors, it is an ominous start to what is traditionally a weak month for stocks and risk appetite.\n\nMany market moves on Tuesday were the largest since the historic volatility burst on Aug. 5 - Wall Street, world stocks and Treasury yields had their biggest declines and U.S. equity volatility had its biggest rise since that day.\n\nOthers were even more eye-opening and ominous.\n\nOil slumped 5%, its biggest fall this year and a reflection of investors' worries over U.S. and Chinese growth. If demand and economic activity are wavering in the world's top two economies, Houston, we have a problem.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia shares tanked 10%, wiping around $265 billion off the company's value in one of the biggest one-day market cap losses on record. If Nvidia has been responsible for much of the tech- and AI-fueled equity rally over the past 18 months, selloffs of this magnitude are a worry.\n\nWeak purchasing managers index data from China and the United States are setting the negative tone, and there are more Asia and Pacific PMI reports scheduled for release on Wednesday, including China's 'unofficial' Caixin service sector PMI.\n\nChina's 'official' PMI figures from Beijing over the weekend showed that manufacturing activity sank to a six-month low in August as factory gate prices tumbled and owners struggled for orders. Shanghai stocks open on Wednesday at a seven-month low.\n\nAustralian GDP figures are also on tap on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters predict growth in the second quarter accelerated to 0.3% from 0.1% at a quarter-on-quarter pace, but year-on-year growth held broadly steady at 1.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the broad-based and aggressive selloff in U.S. stocks on Tuesday, Asian markets will almost certainly open in the red on Wednesday - the old adage still stands: when the U.S. catches a cold, the rest of the world sneezes.\n\nInstitute for Supply Management figures show that U.S. manufacturing activity has contracted every single month since October 2022, with the exception of March this year. That's nearly two years of uninterrupted manufacturing recession.\n\nThis has been offset by expansion in services activity, but rates traders are now attaching a near 40% chance of the Fed beginning its easing cycle later this month with a 50 basis point cut.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Wednesday:\n\n- China 'unofficial' Caixin services PMI (August)\n\n- Australia GDP (Q2)\n\n- South African President Ramaphosa State Visit to China\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever)",

        "title": "Nvidia Gets DOJ Subpoena in Escalating Antitrust Probe",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI processors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office A Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\n\nThe DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint.\n\nAntitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don’t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nNvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting rout on Tuesday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year — fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.\n\nAs part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ’s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for DOJ and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nNvidia has drawn regulatory scrutiny since becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker and a key beneficiary of the AI spending boom. Sales have been more than doubling each quarter, and it’s eclipsed onetime chip leaders such as Intel Corp.\n\nIn the DOJ probe, regulators have been investigating Nvidia’s acquisition of RunAI, a deal announced in April. That company makes software for managing AI computing, and there are concerns that the tie-up will make it more difficult for customers to switch away from Nvidia chips. Regulators also are inquiring whether Nvidia gives preferential supply and pricing to customers who use its technology exclusively or buy its complete systems, according to the people.\n\nNvidia, founded in 1993, made its name by selling graphics cards to computer gamers. But its approach to chipmaking ultimately proved useful for building AI models, a process that involves bombarding the software with data. The company also has rapidly expanded its lineup with a range of software, servers, networking and services — all aimed, Nvidia argues, at speeding up the deployment of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he prioritizes customers who can make use of his products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as he provides them, a policy designed to prevent stockpiling and speed up the broader adoption of AI.\n\nThe success of its products — along with struggles by rivals to field alternative chips — has made Nvidia a crucial part of the supply chain for some of the biggest companies in the world. Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., for example, spend more than 40% of their budget for hardware on the chipmaker’s gear. During the peak of shortages of Nvidia’s H100 accelerator, individual components were retailing for as much as $90,000 each.\n\nAnalysts project that Nvidia will chalk up $120.8 billion of revenue in calendar 2024, up from $16 billion in 2020, with most of that money coming from its data center unit. In fact, Nvidia is set to bring in more profit this year than the total sales of its nearest rival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\n\nThere also are broader regulatory questions about Nvidia’s practices. Access to AI capabilities has become a key focus for governments around the world, with the technology becoming increasingly vital to economic strength and national security.\n\n(Updates with more on Nvidia’s growth in seventh paragraph. A previous version of the story corrected the day of the week.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports Need 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

(25:10) - Episode Roundup: NVDL, NVDX, NVDU, NVD Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nIn this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with William Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, about single-stock ETFs, particularly the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL, which has been immensely popular this year.\n\nNVIDIA NVDA reported very strong results as anticipated. Sales and earnings more than doubled, surpassing sky-high expectations, though the magnitude of these beats was smaller compared to the previous year.\n\nGross profit margins narrowed compared to the previous quarter, partly due to production issues with its next-generation Blackwell chips, which required a minor design change. However, the company stated that production will ramp up as expected and that demand remains strong.\n\nThe stock has slipped after earnings, as investors remain concerned about whether the AI bonanza can continue. Shares are still up over 127% this year alone, and investors have piled into NVDL, hoping to amplify their returns.\n\nSingle-stock ETFs can be effectively used as short-term tactical trading tools by high-conviction traders. However, investors should remember that these products are not meant for buy-and-hold investing and should only be used by those who closely monitor their portfolios.\n\nThere are many single-stock ETFs available to investors today, but only a handful have been popular, mainly those focused on NVDA and Tesla TSLA.\n\nThe Defiance Daily Target 1.75x Long MSTR ETF MSTX, which recently debuted, has already accumulated $180 million. The fund, which provides leveraged exposure to Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy MSTR, is likely to be the most volatile among U.S.-listed ETFs, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTune in to the podcast to learn more.\n\nMake sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the ETF Spotlight and remember to subscribe!

        "title": "U.S. stocks tumble as September starts, investors cool on chips",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slid on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 down more than 2% and the Nasdaq Composite down over 3% as investors softened their optimism about AI in a broad market sell-off following tepid economic data. The benchmark S&P 500 index, Nasdaq and Dow are on track for their biggest daily declines since early August.\n\nShares of chip stocks were hard hit, with AI heavyweight Nvidia tumbling nearly 10% and Wall Street's chip index the PHLX chip index slumping 8%.\n\nTODD SOHN, ETF STRATEGIST, STRATEGAS LLC, NEW YORK:\n\n\"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed. Since the Fed paused rate increases a year ago, more than $30 billion has flowed into U.S. technology-related ETFs; meanwhile all other sector ETFs lost $10 billion in the same time period. Tactical allocations go into those sector ETFs, and imbalances like this can persist for a while, but eventually, the steam runs out of the trade.\n\n\"Then there are the earnings – it’s also hard to keep beating those high expectations. Plus, now we have Broadcom’s results due Thursday. And if you put ten people in a room and asked them why this is happening, at least one would point to the election and the possibility that a new administration would do something to tariffs that would affect chips.\n\n\"Finally, while it wouldn’t be at the top of my list, there’s the calendar. People may have woken up this morning and realized it’s September, which historically is not a great month for stocks. Add to that the fact that so far this year the largest drawdown we’ve seen in the S&P 500 is about 8%, and that typically we’d see something around 14%, people are nervous.\"\n\nSTEVE SOSNICK, MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, GREENWICH, CT.\n\n\"There’s a bit of a post-Nvidia earnings hangover going on today. Those earnings last week were fine; they exceeded expectations. But the magnitude of the beats is shrinking quarter by quarter and that’s not lost on investors. The stock had rallied going into earnings – a huge amount of investment poured into it – and so it wasn’t just sufficient to be good, it had to be great. And Friday’s rally took place in remarkably light volume ahead of a long weekend that happened to coincide with the end of the month, so the typical markup that happens at the end of a calendar month met no resistance.\n\n\"This week is different, and so you’ve seen a nasty day. There’s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality. That’s why the VIX is higher. I don’t think the ISM number, showing a weaker manufacturing sector but higher prices, was at all helpful. And there you have it. Gravity.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDENNIS DICK, TRADER AT TRIPLE D TRADING:\n\n“If you look at the action on Friday, everything was rallying, but Nvidia was lagging. So, you could see the relative strength was poor after their earnings print. It hasn't been good since then.”\n\n\"September is seasonally a very weak month of the year, so I think people are nervous. People are just using this as an excuse to take profits and the most likely candidates to take profits are the semis, because they’ve been the strongest.”\n\nSTEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO:\n\n“We ran right back up to the new high again. There was absolutely zero news over the weekend that meant anything to anybody. But here we are down 600 points.”\n\n“They're expensive. They're not cheap stocks. I mean, wow, I don't know what Nvidia needed to do in the quarter... It was a pretty freaking good quarter, a couple minor issues, but it just goes to show you these things are just very expensive.\n\n“It also becomes a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because so much money now flows into ETFs and so much money flows into S&P and target funds and all that. It just gets spread across the market and it gets spread across the market on a market cap weighted basis, so it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you're one of the top market cap names in the S&P 500 and all the money is pouring into S&P 500 ETFs funds, how does that not help you? And I think that's part of it, and that's part of why you get these stretched valuations.\"\n\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BROOKFIELD, WI\n\n\"People are worrying and thinking about all kinds of macro issues. Has the Fed fumbled the ball? The fear is that it is tripping over its own feet when it comes to the timing and pace of rate cuts instead of sticking the landing. Will the jobs report increase the odds of a recession? The biggest thing here is the possibility that investors will sell what has gone up the most in the face of any softening.\"\n\nSCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE\n\n“We came in with the futures down but once this ISM number came out it triggered this fall.\"\n\n“The market is worried about how drastic the slowdown is going to be. The tech sector, even with this pullback we’ve had today, it’s still up a lot for the year and these things have moved a lot. These stocks led the chart up and on down days they will lead the chart down. When you look at something like 2/10 inversions the last 8 recessions curve has gone positive before recession occurs and we’re only a few basis points away. The market is thinking about that too.”\n\nMICHAEL GREEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIMPLIFY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA\n\n“People are over allocated to Nvidia and many of these names and they’re trying to reduce that exposure. It just has the potential for these things to sell off quite significantly”\n\n“I also think there is a derisking related to election as the election season officially starts now when people are back from Labor Day and everybody is off the beach. Everybody looked at their portfolios and said that going into the political uncertainty of a tight election, we want to have less risk. The PMI report was an excuse for that.”\n\nCALLIE COX, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RITHOLTZ WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK\n\n“Stocks are starting the fall off on a sour note, yet it’s hard to say exactly why people are selling today. Tech is dragging the index down, with Nvidia accounting for about a third of the S&P 500’s losses. We saw a manufacturing report come out this morning that suggests goods demand is slowing. But it wasn’t shockingly bad data, and the narrative of slowing demand isn’t exactly surprising.\n\n“I’d pin some of the drop on seasonality. September is typically a rough month of the year for the stock market – and the S&P 500 has fallen on the Tuesday after Labor Day every year since 2016. People may simply just be catching up to what they missed during the dog days of summer.\n\n“Believe in this bull market, but shield yourself against rash decisions in what could be a turbulent fall. And don’t get distracted by short-term market swings. Since 1950, 60% of market selloffs haven’t reached correction territory, and 26% have ended before the dreaded bear market level.”\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee, Noel Randewich, Chuck Mikolajczak, Chibuike Oguh, David Randall, Laura Matthews and Carolina Mandl; Compiled by Megan Davies)\n\nView comments",

The issue people had on it was not so much the revenue, it was the gross margins.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is getting hit hard in Tuesday's trading. The semiconductor company's share price was down 8.7% as of 2:15 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price is falling in response to rising concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. News out of China and other geopolitical dynamics are also prompting sell-offs for Nvidia and other chip stocks today.\n\nInvestors are feeling jittery ahead of this week's jobs report\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor is expected to release its latest employment data on Friday, and Wall Street is seeing an uptick in bearish sentiment ahead of the report. Investors have been looking forward to interest-rate cuts that are expected to be delivered by the Federal Reserve this month, and the rate reduction could be larger than many analysts initially expected. But there's a catch.\n\nSome analysts now expect that the Fed will cut interest rates by a full point this year. If so, that could be a sign that the central banking authority believes the economy is on track for a recession. Investors are bracing for a worrying jobs report at the end of this week, and Nvidia and other high-profile growth stocks are seeing big valuation pullbacks.\n\nConcerns that China will invade Taiwan hit chip stocks, again\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said that China should also move to reclaim land from Russia if it wants to officially make Taiwan its territory. Rather than suggesting that China should take back Russian land that used to be within its own borders, Lai was making a statement about whether the Chinese government was being logically consistent in some of its stated reasons for plans to exert greater control over Taiwan. Nevertheless, it looks like the comments from Taiwan's president are highlighting the risk that China could invade Taiwan at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWhile the Chinese government has long made claims that Taiwan is already part of its territory, the contention has taken on added importance in light of the crucial role that Taiwan plays in semiconductor manufacturing and artificial intelligence trends. The island nation is home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- the leading contract manufacturer of semiconductors that's responsible for the fabrication of advanced chips for AI applications. Nvidia relies on TSMC for the fabrication of its chips, and any disruptions to the fab leader's output could have major implications for the company's performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wall Street Tumbles, Yen Surges, Oil Sinks Below $70, VIX Spikes As Traders Brace For Volatile Month: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nThe first trading session of September started with a widespread selloff across risk assets, as traders took a cautious approach ahead of what is historically a volatile month for global markets.\n\nAt 1 p.m. in New York, the S&P 500 had dropped 1.6%, while small-cap stocks nosedived 2.7%. The Magnificent Seven, tracked by the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NYSE:MAGS), offered no safe haven, declining 2.3%.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” surged by 20%, reflecting heightened anxiety among investors.\n\nTech stocks were hit hard, with the Nasdaq 100 down 2.5%, on track for its worst one-day drop since Aug. 1.\n\nTuesday’s selloff was reminiscent of the market turmoil caused by the unwinding of the yen-dollar carry trade earlier in the summer. This time, the yen jumped 0.8% against the dollar after hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda overnight.\n\nDespite the yen’s strength, the U.S. dollar gained 0.2% against a basket of other currencies, buoyed by broader market movements.\n\nOn the economic front, U.S. manufacturing data for August showed a deeper-than-expected contraction, with the employment index indicating mounting challenges ahead of a crucial jobs report due later in the week.\n\nTreasury yields fell as the weak manufacturing data fueled speculation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to policy changes, dipped 3 basis points, while the 10-year Treasury note yield dropped 7 basis points. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rose 1.2%.\n\nIn commodities, gold prices slipped 0.5%, while oil prices plunged more than 4%, marking the steepest one-day decline since October 2023. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell to levels not seen since early January 2024, driven by concerns over weaker demand and expectations of increased OPEC supply next month.\n\nCryptocurrency markets also faced pressure, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) down 2.5% as overall sentiment remained weak.\n\nTuesday’s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day change (%) Dow Jones 41,057.56 -1.2% S&P 500 5,557.61 -1.6% Nasdaq 100 19,102.46 -2.4% Russell 2000 2,160.05 -2.7% CBOE VIX 18.54 19.2%\n\nUpdated at 1:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.5% lower to $555.15. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) fell 1.1% to $411.80. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) tumbled 2.4% to $45.16. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) sunk 2.6% to $214.30. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) outperformed, up by 1%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) tumbled 3.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonday’s Stock Movers\n\nAmong mega-cap stocks, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) plummeted 7.6%, marking the worst one-day drop since April. Other major chipmakers also tanked including Marvell Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), down 7.3%, MicronTechnology (NASDAQ:MU), down 6.5%, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), down 6%, and TaiwanSemiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), down 5.7%. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 7.5% amid news that the stock might be removed from the Dow Jones index. Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) tumbled almost 8% after Wells Fargo downgraded the stock to an Underweight rating and slashed its price target.\n\nRead Next:Stock Of The Day: Berkshire Hathaway Trades Above Usual Range — Time To Sell The Warren Buffett Stock?\n\nBear market illustration generated using artificial intelligence via Dall-E.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Wall Street Tumbles, Yen Surges, Oil Sinks Below $70, VIX Spikes As Traders Brace For Volatile Month: What's Driving Markets Tuesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "£223bn wiped off Nvidia stock in Wall Street sell-off",
        "content": "The floor of the New York Stock Exchange on August 16 - Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAmerican stock markets fell this afternoon after manufacturing in the world’s largest economy contracted for a fifth month in a row.\n\nMore than £220bn was wiped of the value of artificial intelligence giant Nvidia, as its shares dropped by nearly 8pc, helping to pull down the index of 30 leading US chipmakers by 6.5pc. It came less than a week after its quarterly financial results and forecasts disappointed investors, despite its sales doubling.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell 2.4pc, the S&P 500 fell 1.4pc and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1pc.\n\nAugust manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) pointed to ongoing challenges in the sector, which has now been in contraction for 21 out of the past 22 months.\n\nThe institute’s purchasing managers’ index (PMI) data gave a reading of 47.2 in August, up marginally from the 46.8 percent recorded in July. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.\n\n“Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty,” said Timothy Fiore of the ISM.\n\nWorries about a slowing US economy helped send stocks on a scary summertime swoon early last month, but financial markets later rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve could pull off a soft landing for the economy.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said that the today’s market reaction is “just speculation about the Fed. If there is any kind of economic weakness, investors believe the Fed will respond by lowering interest rates more aggressively.”\n\nAfter jacking its main interest rate to a two-decade high to beat high inflation, the Fed looks set to ease interest rates later this month in hopes of easing conditions for the economy and avoiding a recession.\n\nMany traders are anticipating the Fed will deliver a full percentage point of cuts to interest rates this year, which is a “recession-sized” amount, according to a Bank of America Global Research report.\n\nThe fall in share prices came as traders await a number of labour market reports due during the week, ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls data for August.\n\nThe jobs market has come under greater scrutiny, after July’s report hinted at a greater-than-expected slowdown, that consequently sparked a global selloff in riskier assets.\n\nOn Friday, closely watched US jobs data is expected to influence the Federal Reserve’s take on the American economy and when it will start lowering interest rates. The move will have repercussions through global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nStephen Innes, analyst at SPI Asset Management, warned that Friday’s data “is shaping up to be a significant litmus test”.\n\nHe said: “A stronger-than-expected payroll number, paired with a lower unemployment rate, could inject some much-needed confidence into the market, signaling that growth risks might be easing, at least for now.\n\n“If the report disappoints, especially if it pushes the unemployment rate higher, we could quickly see growth concerns flare up again.”\n\nAnalysts cautioned investors that September is typically a poor month for US stocks. Sam North, of investment platform eToro, said: “September has historically been a challenging month for US stocks. Between 1928 and 2023, the S&P 500’s return in September is -1.17pc on average.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:39 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us on the Markets blog today. We’ll be back in the morning but you can catch up on all our latest business stories here.\n\n06:20 PM BST\n\nFraud protection plan to be watered down, report says\n\nPlans to reimburse fraud victims by up to £415,000 look set to be dramatically watered down, amid pressure from ministers and fintech firms.\n\nThe FT said that the maximum fraud payout will now be set at £85,000, citing Treasury insiders who had called the planned level “a disaster waiting to happen”.\n\nThe Payment Systems Regulator ins introducing a new fruit regime on Oct 8, which will require banks to pay back almost all victims of “Authorised Push Payment”, which cost consumers £460m last year.\n\nYesterday, The Telegraph reported that banks will be handed new powers to freeze payments for up to four days under new fraud prevention rules.\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nNvidia falls by 8pc in US chip rout\n\nAritificial intelligence giant Nvidia fell by as much as 8.4pc on Wall Street today, less than a week after putting out forecast-beating results.\n\nInvestors have reacted unfavourably to the chipmaker’s quarterly results, which showed doubled sales to a record $30bn (£22.8bn).\n\nHowever, Nvidia’s forecasts for future growth were weaker than expected.\n\nShares are currently down 7.4pc, pulling down the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector, of 30 leading US chip companies, by 6.3pc.\n\n05:39 PM BST\n\nGlobal shares fall after US traders return from a long weekend\n\nGlobal shares fell today with Wall Street weighing them down while US Treasury yields fell amid concerns about manufacturing data.\n\nThe MSCI World index is down 1.3pc.\n\nOil prices sank on expectations of an imminent deal to resolve a dispute that has halted Libyan production and exports following a UN brokered meeting between rival factions, pushing Brent prices to their lowest in 2024.\n\nInvestors are also waiting for Friday’s August US jobs report, which is expected to help determine whether the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point of a half percentage point on Sept 18.\n\nRobert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth, said:\n\nInvestors are wondering are we heading into a recession quicker than was thought or does the Fed have this under control with rate cuts going forward ...\n\nPeople haven’t been able to express their nervousness because they haven’t been in the office. Now they’re back at work and it all comes to a head on the first day of trading.\n\nAdding to volatility was the fact that many investors were back from summer vacations and a long weekend as US markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday yesterday.\n\n05:26 PM BST\n\nEuropean shares fall as US data rekindles growth worries\n\nEurope stocks fell today in their worst session in nearly a month, as US manufacturing data brought concerns about a slowdown in global growth back to the forefront.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index, which includes some of Britain’s biggest companies, dropped 1pc, with Germany’s Dax slipping 0.9pc from record highs. Stocks in France, Spain and Italy dropped between 0.9pc and 1.3pc.\n\nDeclines began this morniong, and increased after US manufacturing data pointed to still-subdued factory activity, increasing jitters over the strength of the world’s largest economy.\n\nAll the major European indexes notched their worst day since the global equity selloff in early August that was also sparked by resurgent worries about a US recession.\n\nAnalysts at Danske Bank said:\n\nOver the summer, market focus has turned from concerns about persistently high US inflation, that would force the [Federal Reserve] to keep rates restrictive, to fears over a slowdown in the US economy.\n\nSharescould struggle for momentum before Friday’s US non-farm payrolls data, a crucial data point as investors assess the possible size of an expected Fed rate cut in September. Key economic data for euro zone countries is also due this week.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is also expected to ease policy this month, though many policymakers have reiterated the need for caution and data-dependency.\n\n“We expect a less aggressive cutting cycle by the ECB compared to Fed due to limited slack in the labour market, more persistent inflation and a lower starting point,” Danske Bank analysts wrote in a note.\n\n05:14 PM BST\n\nUS manufacturing sluggishness ‘may herald steeper rate cuts’\n\nToday’s poor US manufacturing figures could herald bigger rate cuts, a leading accountancy firm has said.\n\nGeorge Lagarias, chief economist at Forvis Mazars, said:\n\nWe would not be too worried about today’s retrenchment. September and October are traditionally the weakest months in the year for equities, so some profit taking, especially after such a strong August is to be expected.\n\nWe suspect that today’s moves are more seasonal than anything.\n\nAnd the manufacturing data only confirms the sluggishness we have been seeing in the past few months. If anything, manufacturing weakness may herald steeper rate cuts, which would be welcome by markets.\n\n05:00 PM BST\n\nOil prices slump amid US and China growth worries\n\nOil prices slumped more than four percent and stock markets retreated Tuesday as worries about growth in China and the United States weighed on sentiment.\n\nA stream of indicators, including the latest manufacturing data, has highlighted weakness in the world’s two largest economies.\n\nTrade Nation analyst David Morrison said:\n\nIt seems that the oil market is indicating a lack of confidence in the global economic outlook, not only due to the downturn in China, but also from increasing uncertainty about the pace of any slowdown across the US.\n\nWith oil producers reluctant to cut output - and the Opec oil cartel and its allies have even been considering boosting production - oil prices have been on a downward trend.\n\nFawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index, said:\n\nThe fact that recent data shows no signs of any acceleration in import demand in China, Europe or North America points to a situation where the oil market is not going to be as tight as expected a few months ago.\n\nOil prices fell even further - with Brent oil, the main international contract, falling under $74 per barrel to its lowest point this year - after US manufacturing data came in below forecasts.\n\nWhile the August reading of the ISM manufacturing survey improved somewhat from July, and will boost the prospects for a faster pace of US interest-rate cuts set to begin this month, investors have recently become worried that the Federal Reserve may have waited too long and the economy may tip into recession.\n\n04:52 PM BST\n\nFTSE closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down this afternoon by 0.8pc.\n\nThe biggest riser was easyJet, down 2.7pc, follow by retailer B&M, up 2.2pc.\n\nAt the other end of the blue-chip index, Rightmove fell 6.8pc, followed by mining company Fresnillo, down 5.6pc.\n\nThe FTSE 250 aslo fell 0.8pc.\n\nThe top riser was Rolex dealer Watches of Switzerland, up 6.3pc, followed by Wag Payments, up 4.1pc.\n\nThe biggest faller was Hochschild Mining, down 5.4pc, followed by TBC Bank, down 4.9pc.\n\n04:45 PM BST\n\nInvestors should ‘step back’ and not worry about normal September losses, suggests analyst\n\nInvestors should not worry too much about “challenging” September stock market losses, an analyst has suggested. Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro, told The Telegraph:\n\nThe market’s sensitivity to unfavourable data is evident, but it’s important to take a step back and recognise what a strong year it has been so far. Equities are trading at near all-time highs, and another dip might actually be welcomed by some market participants as a buying opportunity.\r\n\r\n“Looking ahead, the non-farm payroll report this Friday will likely have a more significant impact on market sentiment, along with the next CPI [inflation] release just before the [interest rate] announcement on September 18.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it’s worth remembering that September has historically been a challenging month for US stocks. Between 1928 and 2023, the S&P 500’s return in September is -1.17pc on average. Given that investors already expect a slowdown, the markets don’t need additional reasons to be cautious during this month.\n\n04:42 PM BST\n\nJohn Lewis plots new £80m housing development despite plans to refocus on retail\n\nJohn Lewis is pushing ahead with a new £80m rental housing scheme despite vowing to “unashamedly” focus on retail. Hannah Boland reports:\n\nThe partnership has submitted a planning application to convert a former warehouse in Reading into a new 215-flat development made up of one, two and three-bed homes. The project is the partnership’s third foray into the property market, following two similar schemes in London.\n\nThe planning submission comes despite John Lewis signalling it would no longer be prioritising property development after changing strategy to refocus on retail.\n\nUnder chairman Dame Sharon White, John Lewis had been seeking to diversify away from retail. Dame Sharon, who steps down later this month, set a target for the partnership to make 40pc of profits in areas outside of the high street by 2030, earmarking housing and financial services as key areas of focus.\n\nHowever, the partnership ditched the target in March. John Lewis said the economic environment had changed “so dramatically” that plans to diversify were now a longer-term project. Instead, executives promised a “relentless focus” on retail.\n\nThe strategy shift comes as a new chairman is set to take over the partnership after Dame Sharon’s five-year term. Jason Tarry, the former UK boss of Tesco, will assume the role later this month.\n\nRead the full story...

Both the FTSE 100 and 250 are down around 0.8pc.\n\nThe decline is echoed on the continent, where Germany’s Dax is down 1pc, and France’s Cac 40 is down a similar amount.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nUS stock market fall ‘doesn’t come as a surprise’, says analyst\n\nA September fall on Wall Street should not surprise us, according to Axel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at online trading platform IG. He said:\n\nHistorically, the US stock markets tends to end in negative territory in September; the return of US traders after Labor Day and a drop in US indices thus doesn’t come as a surprise.\n\nUS stock indices drop by over a percentage point as traders return from their extended Labor Day weekend and US ISM manufacturing data disappoints.\n\nIt shows the 21st monthly contraction in US factory activity in the last 22 periods, underscoring the impact of high interest rates.\n\nUS employment data culminating in non-farm payrolls on Friday might add to the mix and add further pressure to indices which tend to decline in September.\n\n03:53 PM BST\n\nEuro zone bond yields fall as some investors move out of stocks\n\nEuro zone bond yields fell today as cautious investors moved out of stocks, with mixed US manufacturing survey data doing little to lift the downbeat mood.\n\nGermany’s 10-year yield, the bloc’s benchmark, fell to 2.268pc, after hitting a one-month high of 2.349pc on Monday. Yields fall as prices rise, and vice versa.\n\n03:51 PM BST\n\nDollar strengthens as traders eye week of data for the world’s largest economy\n\nThe dollar dropped against the euro and the pound as traders braced for a data-heavy week, including Friday’s US payrolls report that will could shape the path of interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nInvestor focus this week will squarely be on the US payrolls data after Fed chairman Jerome Powell last month endorsed an imminent start to interest rate cuts in a nod to concern over a softening in the labour market.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Reuters expect an increase of 165,000 US jobs in August, up from a rise of 114,000 in July.\n\nAhead of that, job openings data on Wednesday and the jobless claims report on Thursday will be in the spotlight.\n\n03:46 PM BST\n\nUS manufacturing contraction not substantially worse than expected, say economists\n\nThe contraction in US manufacturing activity in August was not “substantially worse than expected”, economists at High Frequency Economics have said.\n\nThe latest industry survey data, which have caused a sell-off on Wall Street this afternoon, show that the decline in the manufacturing sector continued into a fifth consecutive month in August, as demand remained weak.\n\nThe August data point to ongoing challenges in the US manufacturing sector, which has now been in contraction territory for 21 out of the past 22 months.\n\nOne survey respondent in the chemical products sector said they had seen a “noticeable slowdown in business activity.”\n\n“Previous optimism about future growth has been dashed,” they added.\n\nAnother respondent in the computer and electronic products sector said their business outlook was “good” amid an ongoing recovery.\n\n03:37 PM BST\n\nWall Street stocks push downwards after weak manufacturing data\n\nUS stocks are continuing to push down during trading this afternoon following a disappointing start to a week full of updates on the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 is 1.3pc lower, coming off a winning week that had carried it to the cusp of its all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1.2pc, from its own record set on Friday before Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The Nasdaq Composite is 1.9pc lower.\n\nTreasury yields were also sinking in the bond market after a report showed US manufacturing shrank again in August, as it continues to wilt under the weight of high interest rates. Manufacturing has been contracting for most of the past two years, and its performance for August was worse than economists expected.\n\nWorries about a slowing US economy helped send stocks on a scary summertime swoon early last month, but financial markets later rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve could pull off a perfect landing for the economy.\n\nAfter jacking its main interest rate to a two-decade high to slow the economy enough to stifle high inflation, the Fed looks set to ease interest rates later this month in hopes of avoiding a recession.\n\nOther reports later this week that could show how much help the economy needs, including updates on the number of job openings US employers were advertising at the end of July and how strong American services businesses grew last month.\n\nThe week’s highlight will likely arrive on Friday, when a report will show how many jobs US employers created during August.\n\nThe jobs report has once again become the main event for the stock market each month, taking over from updates on inflation, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nMany traders are anticipating the Fed will deliver a full percentage point of cuts to interest rates this year, which is a “recession-sized” amount, Gonzalo Asis and other economists and strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.\n\n03:33 PM BST\n\nTurkey submits request to join Brics nations\n\nTurkey has submitted a request to join the Brics group of major emerging market economies, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government has said.\n\nOmer Celik, spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), said: “Our president has many times stated that we want to become a Brics member.\n\n“The process is now under way.”\n\nThe Brics group of nations include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWith that, I will head off for the day and leave you in the capable hands of Alex Singleton.

Markets were closed on Monday for Labor Day.\n\nThe Fed is priced in to announce at least a quarter of a percentage point cut in borrowing costs from their present range of 5.5pc to 5.25pc - their highest level since 2001.\n\nAnalysts have warned that weakening factory output in the US “don’t bode well for growth”:\n\nFalling backlogs and new orders firmly in contractionary territory don't bode well for growth, and sequential weakness in the employment sub-index might - around the edges - lower the \"whisper\" estimate ahead of Friday's payrolls report.

its worst month since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, new data show, raising concerns that the world’s largest economy could yet be heading for a recession.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing PMI - which is separate to S&P Global’s measure detailed below - gave a reading of 47.2 in August, up marginally  from the 46.8 percent recorded in July.\n\nHowever, its measure of production slid for a fifth month to the lowest level since May 2020, while new orders showed bookings shrinking to a 15-month low.\n\nStock markets plunged sharply following the release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 down 1.1pc and the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.5pc.\n\nTimothy R Fiore, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said: “Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty.”\n\n02:56 PM BST\n\nUS factory output falls for first time in seven months\n\nUS factory output decreased for the first time in seven months during August as sales continued to fall amid increasing reports of weakening demand, a closely watched survey has shown.\n\nThe S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI have a reading of 47.9 in August, down from 49.6 in July and below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the second consecutive month.\n\nManufacturers revealed a reduction in employment, while new export orders were down for the third month running.\n\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:\n\nA further downward lurch in the PMI points to the manufacturing sector acting as an increased drag on the economy midway through the third quarter.\n\nForwardlooking indicators suggest this drag could intensify in the coming months.\n\nSlower than expected sales are causing warehouses to fill with unsold stock, and a dearth of new orders has prompted factories to cut production for the first time since January.\n\nProducers are also reducing payroll numbers for the first time this year and buying fewer inputs amid concerns about excess capacity.\n\nUnited States

year\n\nOil prices have dropped to their lowest level this year amid doubts over demand from the US and China.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, fell below $75 a barrel for the first time since December, wiping out gains that saw it rise above $91 in April.\n\nIt comes as traders nervously await economic data from the US this week, which will indicate how steeply the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates later this month.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices have been hit by weak data from manufacturers and the property sector in China, stoking fears about demand in the world’s second largest economy.\n\n02:35 PM BST\n\nWall Street stocks slump ahead of jobs data\n\nUS stock markets fell as trading began ahead of a week of crucial economic data culminating in a jobs report that could signal how big a cut to interest rates can be expected by Americans.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 0.4pc to 41,387.39, the S&P 500 declined by 0.7pc to 5,610.13 and the

daily drop in three months amid concerns about China’s steel market.\n\nThe metal dropped as much as 2.7pc following its 4.2pc fall on Monday after disappointing Chinese manufacturing and property data.\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts said to clients that the situation for iron ore prices is “challenging” despite it climbing above $100 a ton last week before the underwhelming Chinese data, which has raised concerns about demand from the world’s second largest economy.\n\n02:10 PM BST\n\nBritain has ‘pent up demand’ for City deals, say lawyers\n\nAfter official figures showed the number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in Britain plunged by 35pc in June to just 93, Caroline Rae of Herbert Smith Freehills said:\n\nThe levels of UK M&A activity during the second quarter of 2024 are disappointing but not a surprise given the political uncertainty in the UK caused by the general election.\n\nHowever, we are cautiously optimistic that activity will pick up towards the end of the year as uncertainty over the economic outlook eases.\n\nWhilst the road ahead will continue to be challenging with interest rates and valuation gaps, the pent up demand for M&A remains, particularly from corporates who are looking at transactions to accelerate growth and achieve business transformation and can’t wait around for perfect conditions.\n\n01:50 PM BST\n\nDemand for UK debt not a confidence vote in Government, say analysts\n\nOn the surface, record levels of demand for UK gilts look like a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who has pledged to “get to grips with the public finances” and plug a £22bn blackhole in the public finances, writes Melissa Lawford.\n\nHowever, analysts warned that the figures were not representative of a vote of confidence in the Government.\n\nAlthea Spinozzi, head of fixed income strategy at Saxo Bank, said: “I completely dismiss that idea. We know that fiscal spending will continue to be high.”\n\nInstead, investors are betting that the rate offered on the bonds will offer good value, as the Bank of England continues to cut interest rates, Ms Spinozzi said.\n\nThe high levels of demand will have little impact on government borrowing costs, as these are determined primarily by Bank Rate expectations, said Megum Muhic, vice president at RBC Capital Markets.\n\n“It is expectations on what the Bank of England will do that drives 95pc of government borrowing costs,” he said.\n\n01:48 PM BST\n\nRace to buy British debt as pensioners die younger\n\nA drop in pensioner life expectancy since Covid drove record demand for Labour’s first government bond sale, as funds race to buy more short-term debt.\n\nThe UK raked in a record £110bn of orders in Labour’s first government bond sale, the highest level of demand ever recorded in proportion to the size of the sale, according to analysis by Bloomberg.\n\nThe sale was of a 15-year gilt that will mature in January 2040, paying an interest rate of 4.375pc, and raised £8bn for the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nMegum Muhic, vice president at RBC Capital Markets, said the high demand was driven by falling life expectancies in retirement, which means UK pension funds are racing to buy 15-year bonds, instead of the 25-year bonds.\n\nBetween 2015 and the end of 2023, the average life expectancy for a man aged 65 dropped from 23 years to 21.5, while for women it fell from 25.5 years to less than 24, according to the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.\n\nAround half of this drop off has occurred since the pandemic, but the trend began before Covid.\n\nMr Muhic said: “Pension funds are very big buyers of long-dated gilts and their average liabilities have been getting shorter as average life expectancies (in retirement) have been getting shorter.”\n\nAs pensioner life expectancies shrink, pension fund demand for more short-term debt has been growing.\n\n“It is a big shift going on. There are a lot more buyers in this sector, their focus has shifted from 25-year [bonds],” Mr Muhic said.\n\n01:28 PM BST\n\nDry cleaners Johnson brushes up sales\n\nDry cleaners Johnson Service Group has cheered a jump in sales over the first half of the year, as it expanded its luxury hotel services operations with a deal to buy a rival.\n\nBosses at the textile rental and cleaning business hailed a “strong” performance as it also reported a significant rise in profits.\n\nShares in the London-listed group were down 0.4pc despite revenues growing by 13.5pc to £244.1m for the first half of 2024.\n\nOrganic revenues rose by 5.7pc as it also benefited from acquisitions.\n\nJohnson said sales volumes increased across its hotel, restaurant and catering arm despite “unseasonably poor weather” in the second quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, workwear trade “remained stable” during the half-year, with the company pointing towards improving sales momentum from new and existing customers.\n\nThe company reported that pre-tax profits grew by 38.5pc to £18.5m for the six-month period, as it also confirmed it has acquired competitor Empire Linen Services for £20.6m.\n\n12:58 PM BST\n\nReeves confirms plan to cap corporation tax at 25pc\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed the Government will be capping corporation tax at 25pc, as part of a “tax roadmap for business” which will be set out at the Budget.\n\nDuring Treasury questions, Ms Reeves told the Commons:\n\nInvestment is at the heart of this Government’s growth mission, alongside stability and reform, with robust fiscal rules and respect for economic institutions, the Government is building the confidence needed to deliver private sector investment.\n\nIt is vital also that the tax system supports growth, and that’s why today I can confirm that at the Budget the Government will be outlining a tax roadmap for business, to offer the certainty that encourages investment and gives business the confidence to grow, including our commitment to cap corporation tax at 25pc for the duration of this Parliament, and to retain full expensing.\n\nMPs also raised concerns about cuts to the winter fuel allowance, with one saying that 90pc of pensioners in Devon and Cornwall will be affected by the partial scrapping of the benefit.\n\nSteve Darling, Liberal Democrat MP for Torbay said that in his constituency in Devon that 21,000 pensioners will be impacted by the cut.\n\nIn response, the Chancellor said that the Government was working with charities and local authorities to encourage pensioners who are entitled to the pension credit benefit to apply to do so, adding: “I want to ensure that the lowest income pensioners get the support that they are entitled to.” Rachel Reeves said the Government will be capping corporation tax at 25pc -

in gains, after data pointed to a robust economy and moderating price pressures.\n\nThe Dow is at a record high and the S&P 500 is within 1pc of its own milestone as markets enter into what has been a historically weak month for the main indexes on average.\n\nTraders continue to scour for reassuring signs about the economy, with the release of the monthly ISM manufacturing survey due later.\n\nA number of jobs market numbers will also be published this week, ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls figure for August.\n\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were

of orders for its sale of £8bn of bonds - known as gilts - which mature in 2040, with a yield of 4.375pc.\n\nThe record-matching demand comes in the first bond sold via banks since Labour’s election victory.\n\nIt comes despite Labour claims of a dire economic inheritance, with one Cabinet minister suggesting that Labour was forced to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners to prevent a run on the pound.\n\n11:13 AM BST\n\nPound slips after strongest rally in 10 months\n\nThe pound edged lower against the dollar as investors booked some profits from sterling’s largest monthly rally in 10 months ahead of a US jobs market figures later this week.\n\nData on Tuesday showed summery weather in August helped boost UK consumer spending, as shoppers splashed out on food and drink, although this did little to support the pound.\n\nSterling, which gained 2.1pc in August in its strongest monthly increase since November 2023, was down 0.2pc against the dollar at $1.312, some 1.2pc below last week’s two-year high of $1.327.\n\nThe euro flat against the pound at 84.2p, having hit a one-month low late last week.\n\nBarclays said on Tuesday consumer spending on its credit and debit cards rose by 1pc year-on-year in August, bucking two months of decline.\n\nA separate survey from the British Retail Consortium also showed spending in shops increased by 1pc in annual terms in August.\n\nThe pound is by far the best performing major currency against the dollar this year, having risen by 3.1pc so far, compared with a 0.2pc rise in the euro, the runner-up, and the Norwegian crown, whose 4.5pc decline so far has overtaken the 3.6pc fall in the Japanese yen.\n\nThe principal driver is the expectation among traders that UK rates will take a lot longer to meaningfully fall than those in the euro zone or the United States.\n\n10:52 AM BST\n\nGas prices fall amid large stockpiles\n\nGas prices in Europe have fallen as large stockpiles eased concerns about potential

lockdown in 2020, official figures show, in a blow to Labour as the City braces for the Chancellor to raise taxes in her Budget next month.\n\nOur economics reporter Melissa Lawford has the details:\n\nThe number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in June, just before the general election, plunged by 35pc in a month to just 93, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThis was a sharp drop of 45pc year-on-year and the lowest monthly total since May 2020, when the Covid pandemic hammered transactions.\n\nHigh borrowing costs and market uncertainty have hit activity, with the total number of deals between April and June falling by 17pc to 385, compared to the first three months of the year\n\nSam Fuller, a managing director at Houlihan Lokey’s Consumer Group, an M&A adviser, warned that Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ upcoming October Budget, which is expected to include major tax rises, will likely be a further blow.\n\nMr Fuller said: “The upcoming Budget is feeling increasingly seismic and will almost certainly impact M&A activity levels.\n\n“Changes in corporate and capital gains tax rates, in particular, could impact company valuations and seller incentives, meanwhile an increased tax burden will further hurt an already struggling consumer economy.”\n\nThe value of domestic deals (made by UK companies acquiring other UK companies)

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Plunged (Again) Today and Is Now 20% Off Its High. Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock started off September not with a bang but with a whimper. Late last week, the company reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), and while the results were better than expected, they weren't as robust as some investors had hoped.\n\nThe stock was under pressure again on Tuesday, falling as much as 8.4%. As of 12:27 p.m. ET, the stock was still down 7.8%.\n\nDespite some ongoing uncertainty, investors should take a step back and look at the big picture.\n\nThe forest for the trees\n\nSome investors have become skittish about Nvidia stock in recent weeks, and it's easy to understand why. After five consecutive quarters of triple-digit year-over-year growth, management is forecasting a moderate deceleration, guiding for revenue growth of 80% in the third quarter. Sure, that's slower than it has been, but it's enviable growth nonetheless.\n\nAnother issue weighing on investor sentiment is Nvidia's waning gross margin of 75.1%. While that's an increase compared to 70.1% in the prior-year quarter, it's down from 78.4% in the first quarter. Some investors fear this could be the beginning of a new trend, but that conclusion is premature. Nvidia is scheduled to begin shipping its next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) processors later this year, and previous new product launches have improved margins. This time will likely be no different.\n\nFinally, stories emerged over the weekend of a tussle between China and Japan regarding sanctions on advanced chipmaking equipment, with the former threatening \"economic retaliation,\" according to a report by Bloomberg. This disagreement could potentially spill over into the broader AI sector, but it's simply too early to tell.\n\nTaking a step back\n\nThanks to soaring AI adoption, Nvidia stock has gained more than 650% since early last year (as of this writing) and has seen a commensurate jump in its valuation, currently selling for roughly 38 times forward sales. While that's certainly a premium, Nvidia's track record shows it's worth paying up for.\n\nIt's still early days for the adoption of generative AI, with the market expected to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That shows there's still plenty of time for Nvidia to continue tapping this emerging opportunity.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares are tumbling and dragging the rest of the semiconductor complex down with it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office A Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\n\nThe chipmaker fell as much as 8.4% on Tuesday in the wake of its earnings report last week that failed to live up to lofty expectations. The selloff erased more than $240 billion and helped fuel a 6.1% selloff in an index of 30 chip-related companies.\n\nTo Paul Nolte, market strategist and senior wealth manager at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management, Nvidia’s selloff is likely the result of post-earnings malaise, combined with a broader rotation into cheaper stocks.\n\nNvidia and AI stocks “have been the stars of the market for a while and it isn’t surprising to see them take a back seat for a while,” he said. “There’s still a big question about the ROI from all this spending.”\n\nThe drop in semiconductor stocks comes amid lingering questions about the sustainability of heavy spending on hardware used in artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia and other chipmakers have seen revenue surge amid heavy spending by companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. But those buyers have showed relatively little revenue growth from the outlays and there’s concern about how long that can continue.\n\nIntel Corp., whose shares are the second-worst performing in the Philadelphia semiconductor index this year, was among the biggest decliners on Tuesday, falling as much as 7.4%. The company is said to be exploring various options with investment bankers, including a split of its product-design and manufacturing businesses, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nChip equipment makers KLA Corp. and Applied Materials Inc. also fell more than 6%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, dropped 6.5%.\n\nNvidia has now fallen 12% in the three days following its Aug. 28 earnings report.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Will Push Employees To Their Limits, But Is Reluctant To Let Them Go – 'I'll Torture Them Into Greatness'",
        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has taken a unique approach to leadership, favoring relentless dedication over termination. In a recent interview, Huang clarified that while he demands a lot from his employees, he's not quick to fire anyone. Instead, he opts to “torture them into greatness,” a strategy he says has propelled Nvidia to the forefront of the tech industry.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communitiesnow harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nHuang believes that his tough love, making employees work every day of the week and sometimes staying as late as 2 a.m., sets Nvidia apart. “When you fire somebody,” Huang said, “you are informing him, ‘It was not your mistake’ or ‘I’m the one who made the mistake.’ But I truly believe people can change. They need to learn.” He drew upon his humble beginnings and said, “I used to clean bathrooms, and now I’m the CEO. If I can learn and grow, so can others.”\n\nThe 61-year-old CEO, who is worth $111 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, underscored his commitment to personal development. “I am constantly learning from the 60 people reporting directly to me,” Huang said. He added that this drive for continuous improvement is why he refuses to give up on his employees. “It's tongue in cheek, but people know I'd rather push them to be great than see them fail.”\n\nTrending:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nHuang likened his management style to that of a dedicated coach. “Coaches who believe in their team push them hard because they know their potential,” he said. “Sometimes, people are so close to accomplishing something great. I just don’t want to see them give up when they’re right on the edge.”\n\nDespite the intense work environment, which some employees have described as a “pressure cooker,” Nvidia workers stick around. The lure? Generous stock compensation packages have made many long-term employees multimillionaires. The company’s stock has gained over 3,700% since 2019, making those who stayed there very wealthy.\n\nSee Also:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to beinvesting in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nDespite the long hours and sometimes incendiary meeting atmosphere, Nvidia’s workforce is very stable.

        "title": "Intel debuts second-gen Core Ultra mobile chips in bid to fend off Qualcomm, AMD",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) on Tuesday rolled out its new Intel Core Ultra 200V line of processors as it seeks to fend off the threat of Qualcomm (QCOM) eating into its share of the laptop market.\n\nIntel’s second-generation Core Ultra processors, the Ultra 200V line promise dramatically improved performance and power versus the company’s prior generation of Core Ultra processors and better battery life than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite laptop chips.\n\nThe second-generation Core Ultra processors feature a new design that ditches its predecessor’s low-power island architecture, which was meant to handle certain processes and save on battery life. But it didn’t quite work out as Intel hoped. The company, however, says the new Core Ultra 200V lineup is up to the task.\n\nIn testing, Intel says the Core Ultra 200V uses up to 50% less power versus its predecessor and gets 20% better performance per watt than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip.\n\nUsing the UL Procyon Office Productivity test, which simulates productivity tasks using Microsoft’s Office apps, Intel says it got 20.1 hours of battery life, beating Qualcomm’s 18.4 hours. Qualcomm, however, saw 12.7 hours of battery life while using Microsoft’s Teams, while Intel lasted 10.7 hours.\n\nBattery life has been one of the biggest issues for Intel’s laptop chips. Ever since Apple ditched Intel and began designing its own chips in its MacBooks with extraordinary battery life, Intel has been on its backfoot. Intel says its new Core Ultra 200V line of chips improve on battery life and performance, in strike at rivals Qualcomm and AMD. (Image: Intel) (Intel)\n\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips, which are available in Windows laptops, put even more pressure on Intel to improve its processors’ power consumption or risk seeing its market share erode. The Core Ultra 200V is meant to answer those concerns and then some.\n\nIntel says its chips offer better performance than both Qualcomm's and AMD’s chips in overall performance using synthetic benchmarks. In other words, the chips have the potential to provide the kind of power consumers want along with long-lasting batteries. Though Intel will have to wait until consumers get their hands on laptops with the new chips before it can claim a true win.\n\nIn addition to performance and battery life improvements, Intel’s Core Ultra 200V is also designed to offer AI PC capabilities thanks to its neural processing unit (NPU) that features up to 48 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance. TOPS are a general means of measuring AI workload performance.\n\nQualcomm’s chips offer 45 TOPS, and AMD’s (AMD) Ryzen 300 AI chips provides up 50 TOPS of AI performance.\n\nIt’s important to note that while chip makers are pushing AI PCs, or Microsoft-branded Copilot+PCs, apps that actually use a laptop’s onboard AI capabilities aren’t exactly the norm yet. Many of the AI apps consumers use run on cloud-based systems that bypass a laptop’s NPU.\n\nStory continues\n\nThink of NPU and AI performance as a kind of future-proofing measurement rather than something you’ll be using right out of the gate. If and when apps that use a laptop’s onboard AI become a part of most people’s regular workloads, then those NPUs will be invaluable.\n\nOn the GPU front, Intel is touting its chips’ performance and ability to play some of the latest PC games on the market. Qualcomm has run into difficulty with gaming on its Snapdragon chips, marking a missed opportunity to lure in gamers willing to pay top dollar for laptops with powerful processors.\n\nIntel’s second-generation Core Ultra line comes as the company is contending with some of its largest challenges in its 56-year history. Nvidia (NVDA) dominates the AI data center business thanks to its high-powered GPUs, while rival chip builder TSMC is outpacing the company in terms of chip technologies.\n\nIntel is working to turn that around, however, building out its own manufacturing capabilities in locations across the globe, creating its Intel Foundry business segment, and preparing its next-generation chip technology it calls Intel 18A, which CEO Pat Gelsinger says will return the company to its place on the semiconductor throne.\n\nBut so far Intel is still the largest customer of its foundry business, though it’s also signed a deal to produce some of Microsoft’s (MSFT) custom chips.\n\nDuring its latest earnings report, Intel announced lower than anticipated revenue and earnings per share and issued disappointing guidance for the current quarter. What’s more, the company said it is cutting 15% of its workforce and suspended its dividend payment as it focuses on a broader restructuring plan.\n\nShares of Intel are off a whopping 56% year-to-date, falling to $20.56 per share as of midday Tuesday. Rival AMD’s stock is up 131%, while AMD’s is up 2.3% year-to-date. Qualcomm shares are up 19%. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Sell Nvidia, Buy Arm?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delighted its shareholders with a return of nearly 1,000% since the start of 2023, but Thursday brought investors a rare post-earnings drop as the AI chip leader closed down 6.4% for the day.\n\nWhile the company beat headline estimates on the top and bottom lines, the sell-off in the stock seemed to have more to do with valuation and growth concerns.\n\nNvidia is now worth $3 trillion, meaning the upside for the stock has become more limited even as it's still posting blowout growth. Revenue was up 122% in the second quarter to $30 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were up 152% to $0.68.\n\nWhat was also surprising about the market's reaction to the news is that although Nvidia shares fell, many of its AI chip stock peers were up for most of the session, and one, in particular, was a big winner. That was Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which finished the day up 5.3% even though there was no company-specific news out on the stock.\n\nIn other words, investors seem to think that Nvidia's results were good news for the broader AI sector as they indicated strong demand for its chips, but they no longer see Nvidia as the best way to play the AI boom.\n\nIs Arm a better AI stock to own than Nvidia now? Let's take a closer look at the two companies to find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat you should know about Nvidia and Arm\n\nNvidia and Arm work closely together. Arguably, no other company has benefited more directly from Nvidia's success than Arm.\n\nNvidia uses Arm's CPU architecture in a number of its components, most notably the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips, which, according to Nvidia, are designed for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing applications.\n\nNvidia is also using Arm's Grace CPU for its next-generation Grace Blackwell Superchips, which feature liquid cooling and are part of the Nvidia GB200 NVL72 that will provide up to a 30x performance increase over traditional Nvidia H100 GPUs. Arm CEO Rene Haas said Grace Blackwell would be a \"very, very good chip for us in the AI data center.\"\n\nPart of Arm's attraction to investors looking to diversify away from Nvidia is that its unique business model means it's yet to capture much of the benefit from the explosion in demand for AI chips.\n\nUnlike its chip stock peers, Arm makes money from licensing its architecture to companies like Nvidia, which then put it in their chips. Arm collects revenue in two ways. It makes money when it sells licenses, and it makes money through royalties later on when those products start to sell.\n\nThere tends to be a lag of two to three years between collecting revenue from a new license and the royalty from the product with that license, so Arm has yet to collect significant royalties from the generative AI boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, licensing revenue has already soared, up 72% to $472 million in its most recent quarter. Arm attributed that surge to multiple high-value license agreements from thought-leading companies.\n\nBased on the jump in licensing revenue, we should see a surge in royalties, which generally make up the majority of Arm's revenue, in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIs Arm a better AI stock than Nvidia?\n\nWhile investors seemed to be rotating from Nvidia to Arm on Thursday, you might be surprised to learn that Nvidia is still the cheaper stock of the two. On a trailing price-to-earnings basis, Nvidia is now valued at a multiple based on adjusted EPS of 53, compared to Arm at 94.\n\nArm is also more expensive on price-to-sales basis at a multiple of 38, compared to Nvidia at 32.\n\nBoth companies generate huge margins, but Nvidia is still the faster growing of the two. However, that could change in the coming quarters as Arm's royalty revenue starts to kick in.\n\nThe biggest advantage Arm has over Nvidia is that it's easier for the stock to double, as its market cap is much lower than Nvidia's and its potential doesn't seem as fully understood by the market as Nvidia's. Arm has the greater potential to surprise to the upside.\n\nStill, selling Nvidia to buy Arm doesn't seem quite right; Nvidia's competitive advantages are just as strong as they were before the report, if not stronger.\n\nNvidia stock probably won't double again anytime soon, but it still deserves a place in any AI stock portfolio. Holding shares of both Nvidia and Arm, two dominant leaders in their respective categories, makes the most sense for AI stock investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bitcoin Rally to Resume With Rate Cuts: 3 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Watch",
        "content": "Bitcoin edged higher on Sept. 2, after a not-so-impressive August. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose around 0.2% and was trading at $58,972, after declining more than 7% last week.\n\nSeveral factors have been impacting Bitcoin’s price over the past month. However, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential left and is poised to resume its rally as the Federal Reserve gears up to start its rate cuts. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in crypto-centric stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR and Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD.\n\nMultiple Factors Impacting Bitcoin Price\n\nThe Bitcoin rally that started in 2023 gathered pace in the first quarter of this year, with the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. However, its price has since slumped and remained rangebound.\n\nEven the halving event in April did not manage to drive up Bitcoin’s price. The halving event, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks in half to limit the total Bitcoin supply to 21 million, usually boosts demand and lifts prices. However, Bitcoin declined sharply following its halving.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was trying to stage a rebound but plunged in early August as global markets witnessed a major selloff on fears of a potential U.S. recession. The fears have eased over the past few weeks, thanks to a spate of positive economic data that showed a steady decline in inflation.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin is still struggling to make a rebound as it faced setbacks from ongoing worries about token distributions and large-scale sale events, particularly involving the defunct exchange Mt. Gox.\n\nTricky September Ahead for Bitcoin Stocks\n\nSeptember could be a testing time for Bitcoin. Historical data shows that Bitcoin has had negative returns in September in nine out of the past 13 years, making it one of the worst months for the cryptocurrency, with an average decline of 5.36%.\n\nHowever, investors are optimistic about Bitcoin making a solid rebound once the Federal Reserve starts its easing cycle. Inflation has been declining steadily, and Federal Reserve officials are confident that it is well on track to reach the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nMarket participants are now almost 100% sure about a 25-basis point rate cut in September. Lower borrowing rates bode well for growth assets like cryptocurrencies as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t provide yields.\n\nIn a low-interest-rate environment, investors are more inclined to seek assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve greater risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto-Centric Stocks in Focus\n\nWe have narrowed our search to three crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 3, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, AT&T Inc. T, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Steel Partners Holdings L.P. SPLP and Natural Resource Partners L.P. NRP.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for NVIDIA, AT&T and Lockheed Martin\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., AT&T Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Steel Partners Holdings L.P. and Natural Resource Partners L.P.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nNVIDIA shares have lost some ground following the beat-and-raise quarterly release on Wednesday, August 28th, with market participants seemingly shrugging the company's raised guidance. But this lack of stock market follow through for the shares could very well be a reflection of the stock's impressive gains over the past year rather than a comment on underlying business trends.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\n\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds. The United States and China's tit-for-tat trade war is also a major concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nShares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+23.4% vs. +21.7%). The company is expected to benefit from an integrated fiber expansion strategy that improves broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. The deployment of O-RAN architecture is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network to reduce the huge debt burden.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a customer-centric business model, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in its postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans. However, lower demand for legacy voice and data services is affecting revenues in the Business Wireline vertical.\n\nDeclining Mobility equipment sales are a concern. Fierce competition in a saturated wireless market will likely strain margins. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome while high debt burden remains a perennial problem.\n\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\n\nLockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. +1.9%). The company's broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.\n\nThe solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position.\n\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company's operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\n\nShares of Steel Partners' have declined -2.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry's decline of -7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $795.34 million reported strong financial results in second-quarter 2024, with revenues growing 6.4% year over year to $533.2 million and a 113.2% surge in net income to $124.9 million.\n\nRevenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024 also increased by 6.7% to $1 billion. This growth reflects the company's effective diversification across its industrial and financial services segments. SPLP's operational efficiency is highlighted by a 15.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 14.7% in second-quarter 2023.\n\nSteel Partners' balance sheet is robust, with $256.4 million in cash and a $112-million debt reduction in the first half of 2024, enhancing financial stability. Investments in the Supply Chain segment, which saw 192% in revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024, position SPLP for long-term growth, particularly as global supply chains evolve.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\n\nNatural Resource Partners'shares have declined -0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Coal industry's decline of -2.4%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.13 billion faces significant risks from its heavy reliance on coal royalties, with metallurgical coal accounting for 75% of second-quarter 2024 coal royalty revenues.\n\nWeakened steel demand, particularly in China and Europe, is pressuring coal prices, potentially reducing NRP's cash flow. The secular decline in U.S. thermal coal demand, driven by environmental regulations and competition from natural gas, further threatens long-term revenues.\n\nAdditionally, a surge in Chinese soda ash production is depressing global prices, impacting NRP's profitability. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and high financing costs also pose challenges, while stringent environmental regulations and reliance on lessees increase operational risks. Overall, NRP's exposure to volatile coal markets and regulatory risks positions it in a challenging environment.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Resource Partners here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 3, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Block Inc. SQ.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nBitcoin to Gain from Rate Cuts: 4 Crypto-Centric Stocks with Upside\n\nThe crypto market is struggling to stage a rebound after a solid first half. On Aug. 27, Bitcoin fell 6%, marking its biggest decline since the turmoil that gripped global markets earlier this month.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin had a great 2023 and hit an all-time high earlier this year. The recent decline is temporary as the cryptocurrency still has immense potential. Given this situation, it would be ideal to watch out for crypto-centric stocks like Robinhood Markets, Inc., Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and Block Inc..\n\nBitcoin's Decline Temporary\n\nBitcoin plunged earlier this month as global markets witnessed a massive selloff triggered by fears that the U.S. economy could slip into a recession. However, the fears were soon eased by some positive economy data that showed a steady decline in inflation.\n\nMarkets rebounded and Bitcoin, along with other major cryptocurrencies, also started staging a rebound. However, the rebound rally came to a halt earlier this week, with Bitcoin price slipping to $58,116 on Aug. 27 from a high of $63,209.\n\nOn Aug. 30, Bitcoin was hovering around 59,600 as it attempted to make a rebound.\n\nBitcoin's current downward trend appears to be driven by the recent selloff, which is influenced by macroeconomic factors and other market trends.\n\nRate Cuts to Boost Bitcoin Stocks\n\nBitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. The surge this year gained traction after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. This approval was intended to offer both individual investors and large institutions a regulated and accessible way to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the rally lost momentum in April, and even the Bitcoin halving event did not manage to drive up the price.\n\nThe halving event, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half to cap the total Bitcoin supply at 21 million, typically stimulates demand and drives prices higher. Despite this, Bitcoin saw a significant decline.\n\nHowever, a decline in inflation has finally raised hopes that the Fed will soon start its rate cuts. Also, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that rate cuts were on the horizon. Market participants are now expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut in November, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nLower interest rates typically reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don't provide yields, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors are more inclined to seek assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve greater risk.\n\nThe shift makes cryptocurrencies, which are known for their volatility and potential for higher returns gains, more attractive to a wide range of investors.\n\nCrypto-Centric Stocks in Focus\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 35.7% over the last 60 days. Robinhood Markets currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR's commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the last 60 days. IBKR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA Advanced Micro Devices Intel and Arm Holdings",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 3, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC and Arm Holdings plc ARM.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nThe Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD or INTC?\n\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. recently reported its fiscal second-quarter results, following which its shares dipped. Does this mean that NVIDIA has lost its sheen to arch-rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Intel Corp. in the semiconductor space? Or, does it still have the potential to increase shareholders' wealth soon? Let's examine –\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Earnings Top, Shares Drop\n\nNVIDIA recently posted blowout second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues and net income that easily surpassed analysts' estimates. For the quarter ending on July 28, 2024, earnings per share for the chipmaker came in at $0.68, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 152% year over year.\n\nTotal reported revenues were $30 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and 122% from a year ago. Revenues of each segment, such as data center, gaming, professional visualization, and robotics were up from the previous quarter and year.\n\nStrong demand for existing Hopper chips and shipping of next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips to be launched later this year boosted NVIDIA's quarterly results.\n\nHowever, despite such promising quarterly results, NVIDIA's shares dipped 6.4% in Thursday's trading and were 2.1% lower on Wednesday. This is because the performance expectations were much higher as the NVIDIA stock is currently the S&P 500's best performer this year.\n\nWhy You Shouldn't Sell NVIDIA Stock\n\nThe share price drop at the moment is just a blip for NVIDIA. This is because if we look at the broader picture, with the Federal Reserve all set to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, NVIDIA's capital expenditure outlays on AI-related infrastructure are expected to increase.\n\nAI is a growing field, with the industry expected to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nWhile the Blackwell AI chip launch will give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers, its gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce, is expected to help NVIDIA penetrate the growing gaming market. NVIDIA's initiative to enter the industrial metaverse space with the help of Siemens is also a tailwind for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns with AMD Stock\n\nLike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices also makes semiconductors and is trying to enter the gaming space. However, NVIDIA is way ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, whose latest quarterly revenues were minuscule compared to that of NVIDIA. In the recently reported quarter, Advanced Micro Devices' total revenues increased just 9% from a year ago.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is investing heavily in AI, but unlike NVIDIA, they are late to the party. Any AI investment takes a long period to generate returns on the invested capital. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices hasn't poured money into the necessary AI infrastructure, which can be an issue for the company in the long run.\n\nAnyhow, Advanced Micro Devices is losing the competition with NVIDIA. Per data from Jon Peddie Research, Advanced Micro Devices' market shares in GPUs have fallen from 35% to 12% over the past decade, while NVIDIA's shares have risen from 65% to 88%.\n\nINTC Stock – Stands No Chance in the Competition\n\nWhile NVIDIA is in a league of its own, Intel is struggling to compete with Advanced Micro Devices, which has seen some progress in the production of high-performance processing machinery.\n\nIntel is in dire straits after failing to progress in the foundry business. Intel failed to make the most of the ever-expanding AI applications industry, where most of its peers are doing reasonably well.\n\nIntel's server and networking segment is also being disrupted by Arm Holdings plc. Many of ARM's designs in the micro server segment have been accepted by Intel's competitors. Intel's shares never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst and currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Fundamentals Much Stronger\n\nNVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This is because the NVIDIA stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 124.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have an ROE of 6% and 1.8%, respectively. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is considered very good.\n\nNVIDIA's net profit margin is 55%, way more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel's 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Any reading above the threshold of 20% signifies the company has been able to keep operation costs under control and generate profit from sales. As a result, the $2.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 74.8% year over year.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Trading Above 200DMA\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the NVIDIA stock has been constantly trading above its 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, indicating a long-term uptrend.\n\nOn the other hand, the prices of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have fallen below the 200 DMA this year, a tell-tale sign of a persistent downtrend.\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVIDIA Stock\n\nWith NVIDIA's shares exhibiting a bullish trend and the stock faring much better than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI space and beyond, notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 13.5% from the stock's last closing price of $125.61. The analysts' highest price target is at $200.\n\nHence, despite the recent hiccups, investors should hang on to the NVIDIA stock more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as AI is here to stay (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Is Now the Time to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) propelled shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) to incredible gains over the past year, from a 52-week low of $39.23 in 2023 to a high of $140.76 on June 20. This prompted a 10-for-1 stock split, and a 150% increase in its dividend in 2024.\n\nNow, after several consecutive quarters of impressive sales, Wall Street's expectations of the semiconductor giant are quite high. That seems to have contributed to a drop in Nvidia's stock after it reported earnings on Aug. 28.\n\nDoes the recent decline in Nvidia's share price create a buy opportunity? Or did the company's latest earnings report signal warning signs? To answer these questions, here's a look into where the company is at now.\n\nCustomer demand for Nvidia's products\n\nFor starters, let's unpack the results from its fiscal second quarter, ended July 28. The company experienced a 122% year-over-year rise in Q2 sales to hit a record $30 billion.\n\nThis triple-digit revenue growth was no small feat given what it accomplished in 2023's fiscal Q2. At that time, Nvidia achieved a 101% year-over-year sales increase as generative AI began to take off.\n\nFollowing 2023's Q2 performance with another triple-digit year-over-year increase illustrates the insatiable customer demand that exists for Nvidia's products. It's a key reason behind the company's investment appeal.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, describing what's currently driving this, stated, \"Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\" Hopper is the name of Nvidia's platform for the current generation of graphics processing units (GPUs) specifically designed for AI.\n\nThe company expects Hopper GPU shipments to increase in the second half of its 2025 fiscal year. Blackwell is the next generation GPU platform, scheduled for a production ramp up in Nvidia's fiscal Q4, and continuing into fiscal 2026.\n\nBoth the Hopper and Blackwell GPUs won accolades recently for industry-leading performance related to AI inference. Inference measures an AI's ability to correctly make decisions and execute tasks. These results demonstrate why Nvidia products are in such high demand.\n\nThe cause of Nvidia's Q2 post-earnings stock drop\n\nAs a result of the customer demand the company is experiencing, Nvidia estimated its fiscal Q3 revenue to reach around $32.5 billion. That represents nearly an 80% jump up from the prior year's $18.1 billion.\n\nYet since Q3's projected sales isn't as dramatic a year-over-year increase as Q2, some on Wall Street took it as a sign of slowing growth, contributing to Nvidia's share price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Huang previously indicated Blackwell production would ramp up in fiscal Q3, so the delay to Q4 affected Q3 sales estimates.\n\nHowever, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is a \"buy\" rating with a median price target of $147.80 for Nvidia stock. As this target reveals, Wall Street believes there's still good upside for shares, especially after the recent price drop.\n\nTo buy or not to buy Nvidia shares\n\nI agree with the Wall Street consensus that Nvidia stock is a buy. Looking at the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess stock valuation, Nvidia looks undervalued compared to major competitors AMD and Intel. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nContributing to this is Nvidia's growth in diluted earnings per share (EPS). In Q2, EPS reached $0.67, an impressive 168% year-over-year increase. In addition, the company more than doubled its fiscal Q2 free cash flow (FCF) to $13.5 billion from $6.1 billion in 2023.\n\nAnother positive factor in Nvidia's Q2 results is the year-over-year sales growth across all of its lines of business, including its gaming division. Gaming revenue was up 16% year over year to $2.9 billion.\n\nThis is significant because rival AMD's Q2 gaming sales plunged a whopping 59% year over year to $648 million. As its results demonstrate, Nvidia is able to maintain strong demand, even in markets where competitors struggle.\n\nThis strength lends credence to estimates that Nvidia commands in the neighborhood of 70% to 95% of the GPU market for AI. And with the AI industry forecast to grow from $136 billion last year to $826 billion by 2030, the long-term investor has many years of industry growth to reap the rewards of owning Nvidia stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Intel's Dow status under threat as struggling chipmaker's shares plunge",
        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Intel was one of the first two tech companies to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average during 1999's dot-com era, along with Microsoft. Now, a slump in its share price could cost the American chipmaker its place in the blue-chip index.\n\nAnalysts and investors said Intel was likely to be removed from the Dow, pointing to a near 60% decline in the company's shares this year that has made it the worst performer on the index and left it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow.\n\nA removal will hurt Intel's already bruised reputation. The company has missed out on the artificial intelligence boom after passing on an OpenAI investment and losses are mounting at the contract manufacturing unit that the chipmaker has been building out in hopes of challenging TSMC.\n\nTo fund a turnaround, Intel suspended dividend and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce during its earnings report last month. But some analysts and a former board member believe the moves might be too little, too late for the chipmaker.\n\n\"Intel being removed was likely a long time coming,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group.\n\nThe latest results may be the final push needed to finally see the company removed from the Dow, Detrick added.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, declined to comment on whether Intel could be removed from the index.\n\nChanges to the index are made as needed and the last update happened in February when struggling pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.com.\n\nStock price is a key element for inclusion in the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 index which takes into account market value.\n\nThe Dow's selection committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Currently, the highest weighted stock - UnitedHealth Group - is priced about 29 times higher than Intel.\n\nThe chipmaker is also the least influential member of the index with a meager 0.32% weightage based on its closing price of $20.13 on Aug. 29.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the larger impact would be to Intel's reputation, the exclusion would further hit its shares, which are down more than 70% from a record high in August 2000, leaving the chipmaker with a market value below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years.\n\nWHO WOULD REPLACE INTEL?\n\nNvidia could replace Intel on the Dow, according to Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Intel investor Gabelli Funds.\n\nWith shares up more than 160% this year, Nvidia has become one of the world's most valuable firms thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI. A stock split in May also increased the odds of its inclusion.\n\nBut some investors said Nvidia might be too volatile a stock for the Dow, which usually prefers more stable stocks.\n\nTexas Instruments, a nearly century-old chipmaker with significant production capacity within the United States, is another option to replace Intel in the index, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Intel.\n\nTexas Instruments' shares have risen more than 20% this year to $211.09 as of Thursday, which is closer to the Dow constituents' average price of about $209.\n\nIn the event of a removal, a stock with a price closer to the average price of the current list might be preferred as a replacement, said David Blitzer, who chaired the S&P Dow Jones Indices' Index Committee for more than two decades until 2019.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "title": "Wall Street Predicted Nvidia Stock Was Headed Lower Before the Company's Q2 Update. Here's What Analysts Think Now.",
        "content": "By most standards, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) hit the ball out of the park with its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results. The company reported record revenue of $30 billion, a 122% year-over-year increase. It posted earnings that soared 168% from the prior-year period. Nvidia's guidance projected even higher revenue next quarter.\n\nAnd yet the stock sank after these stellar numbers. Although Nvidia exceeded Wall Street estimates, the GPU maker didn't hit the \"whisper\" earnings number that was higher than the consensus public analysts' estimate.\n\nWall Street predicted Nvidia stock was headed lower even before its Q2 update. Here's what analysts think now.\n\nBullish bears or bearish bulls\n\nBefore I get to analysts' current thinking about Nvidia, let me first assure you that I don't view any of them as having Nostradamus-like predictive powers. The average Wall Street price target for Nvidia before the company's Q2 update was roughly 2% below its closing price prior to the earnings release. However, this was a 12-month price target. Nvidia fell more than that almost immediately on the day after its Q2 announcement.\n\nImportantly, most Wall Street analysts weren't all that negative about Nvidia. Of the 38 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August, 14 rated Nvidia as a \"buy.\" Another seven recommended the stock as a \"strong buy.\" That's a majority (55%) with positive views about Nvidia. Most of the other analysts -- 14 of them -- rated the stock as a \"hold.\" Only two assigned a negative \"underperform\" or \"sell\" rating to Nvidia.\n\nBut the average price target still reflected an expectation that the stock would fall over the next 12 months. I describe the analysts who maintain positive ratings on Nvidia yet give it price targets lower than the current share price as bullish bears or bearish bulls. They want to have it both ways.\n\nSticking with their stories\n\nLet's now shift to what analysts say about Nvidia after its Q2 update. LSEG reported that 18 analysts issued reports on Nvidia on Aug. 29 (the day after its quarterly earnings release). Guess how many changed their recommendation? Pat yourself on the back if you answered zero.\n\nHowever, several analysts did adjust their 12-month price targets. The average price target is now roughly 5% below Nvidia's share price. Wall Street is still full of bullish bears/bearish bulls.\n\nAnalysts seem to be sticking with their stories. Most of them still like Nvidia. Only one of those 18 updates was less than positive -- and it was a \"neutral\" rating. But they nonetheless think the stock could decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big question is: Why? Maybe it's because some analysts (perhaps many of them) don't believe Nvidia's customers will see positive returns on investment (ROI) with their purchases of the company's GPUs. For example, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari asked in the Q2 earnings call about customer ROI, noting that \"there's a pretty heated debate in the market\" about the subject. TD Cowen's Matt Ramsay also raised a question about customer ROI.\n\nWhy Wall Street could be wrong about Nvidia\n\nI think it's possible that Wall Street could be wrong about Nvidia's stock performance over the next 12 months. I also think those who don't expect Nvidia's customers to see strong ROI could be wrong.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang pushed back on skepticism about customer ROI. He argued in the Q2 earnings call, \"The people who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away.\"\n\nHuang rightly noted that a major data center migration from CPUs to GPUs is underway. He highlighted the tremendous potential for Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will begin shipping in fiscal 2025 Q4. He pointed out the promise of generative AI in robotics, software development, large-scale recommendation systems, and more.\n\nAll of this translates to significant growth prospects for Nvidia, not just over the next 12 months but over the next 10 years and beyond. We just might see Wall Street's price targets better align with their recommendations for the stock in the next few months as Nvidia begins to report its Blackwell revenue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Supercharged Growth Stocks Up 302% to 775% in 2 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence and pent up travel demand have been powerful catalysts for the post-pandemic stock market. Consider the three best-performing stocks in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the last two years, as listed below:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares advanced 775%. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) shares advanced 591%. Royal Caribbean Cruises(NYSE: RCL) shares advanced 302%.\n\nImportantly, Wall Street expects more gains from all three growth stocks. Nvidia's median target of $150 per share implies 26% upside from its current share price of $119. Super Micro's median target of $675 per share implies 54% upside from its current share price of $437. And Royal Caribbean's median target of $184 per share implies 12% upside from its current share price of $164.\n\nInvestors should never rely too heavily on price targets, but these three monster growth stocks warrant further consideration. Here are the important details.\n\nNvidia: 2-year return of 775%\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in data center accelerators, meaning they speed up tasks like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. GPUs perform technical calculations faster and more efficiently than central processing units (CPUs), and Nvidia regularly set records at the MLPerfs, objective tests that measure AI training and inference capabilities.\n\nThe company holds up to 95% market share in AI chips, according to analysts. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it has spent decades developing its CUDA platform, a software ecosystem that streamlines data preparation and application development across a broad range of disciplines. The company has also extended its ability to monetize AI by branching into cloud services and adjacent hardware markets, including data center networking and server CPUs.\n\nOver the last two years, Nvidia's revenue increased 240% and GAAP earning soared 599%. The company is well positioned to maintain that momentum. Grand View Research expects the graphics processor market to grow at 27% annually through 2030 due to strong demand for AI accelerators.\n\nNvidia shares declined following its second-quarter report, despite strong results, but most analysts remain bullish. Angelo Zino at CFRA believes Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade as the world becomes more AI-driven.\" More broadly, Wall Street expects the chipmaker's earnings to increase at 36% annually over the next three years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings seem reasonable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer: 2-year return of 591%\n\nSuper Micro Computer develops high-performance compute platforms for enterprise and cloud data centers. Its portfolio ranges from individual servers and storage systems to full server racks optimized for workloads like artificial intelligence. In fact, Super Micro is the leading supplier of AI servers, and its market share is expected to reach 17% in 2026, up from 10% in 2023, according to Bank of America analysts.\n\nWhat sets Super Micro apart are internal engineering capabilities and its modular approach to development, both of which support rapid product rollout. CEO Charles Liang says the plug-and-play nature of its servers lets the company quickly build a broad range of products featuring the latest chips from suppliers like Nvidia. In turn, Super Micro tends to beat competitors to market by two to six months.\n\nIn the last two years, Super Micro's revenue increased 188% and GAAP earnings jumped 277%. The company is well positioned to maintain that momentum because analysts at JPMorgan expect AI server sales to increase sixfold between 2023 and 2028. Additionally, Super Micro is a leader in direct liquid cooling (DLC) solutions, which lower data center costs by controlling server temperatures more efficiently than traditional air cooling. Demand for DLC should increase in lockstep with demand for AI servers because they throw off a lot of heat.\n\nSuper Micro shares recently nosedived when short-seller Hindenburg Research discovered \"accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.\" But most analysts remain bullish. Wall Street expects Super Micro's earnings to increase at 49% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 22 times earning look pretty cheap.\n\nRoyal Caribbean: 2-year return of 302%\n\nRoyal Caribbean is the second-largest cruise company in the world. Its fleet of 68 ships spans five brands that travel to about 1,000 different destinations. That scale affords the company a durable economic moat in the capital-intensive cruise industry. Additionally, Jaime Katz at Morningstar recently wrote, \"Royal Caribbean has carved out a compelling position in cruising thanks to its contemporary brand and compelling destinations.\"\n\nIn November 2022, Royal Caribbean outlined the Trifecta Program, a three-year financial initiative meant to return the company to pre-pandemic strength: (1) Adjusted EBITDA per available passenger cruise days of at least $100, (2) adjusted earnings per share of at least $10, and (3) return on invested capital of at least 13%. Those targets were chosen because they exceeded pre-pandemic records.\n\nRoyal Caribbean satisfied all three criteria in the most recent quarter, putting it 18 months ahead of schedule. That means the company is (1) monetizing customers more efficiently, (2) operating more profitably, and (3) allocating capital more effectively. Royal Caribbean also reinstated its dividend, another sign of improving financial strength. The quarterly payout is currently $0.40 per share, which gives a dividend yield of roughly 1%.\n\nWall Street expects Royal Caribbean's adjusted earnings per share to grow of 19% annually through 2026. That estimate makes the current valuation of 16.3 times adjusted earnings look reasonable, but not cheap. I say that because shares traded around 14 times adjusted earnings in the years leading up to the pandemic. The current price is a fine entry point, but I wouldn't fault investors that wait for a slightly cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) company is the number on trending ticker in pre-marker trading after analysts said it could reach to a $10tn valuation.\n\nBeth Kindig, the lead tech analyst at I/O Fund, is forecasting strong growth and \"fireworks\" for the stock after its Blackwell advanced chip launch.\n\nKindig predicted that Nvidia's growth trajectory should become more apparent once Wall Street analysts upwardly revise fiscal estimates for the following year. That should be a \"big moment\" for Nvidia, followed by the release of shipping volume figures for Blackwell in 2025.\n\n“That’s going to be fireworks, is how I would put it. Absolute, ultimate fireworks for Blackwell will come in first-quarter, with that second-quarter guide,” Kindig said. “Early next year will be fireworks again for Nvidia, and we will be on track for that $10tn.”\n\nThese new chips are nearly double the size of their predecessors and pack 2.6 times more transistors, which has led to significant manufacturing challenges and impacted profit margins.\n\nRolls-Royce (RR.L)\n\nRolls-Royce shares have staged a recovery in early trading, following Cathay Pacific's announcement that it expects to have its fleet fully operational by the weekend. The Hong Kong-based airline had temporarily grounded its A350 aircraft for inspections after discovering issues with their Rolls-Royce engines.\n\nCathay Pacific (CPCAF) disclosed that 15 components needed replacement after a \"first of its type\" engine component failure forced a Zurich-bound flight to turn back on Monday. In response, the airline cancelled at least 34 round-trip flights and initiated precautionary inspections across its 48-strong fleet.\n\nRead more: Sterling outperforms as traders bet on September interest rate hold\n\nThe airline said three of the 48 Rolls-Royce-powered planes it had inspected had already gone through successful repairs and all of the jets were expected to resume operation by Saturday.\n\nThe aerospace engineering company said in a statement it was aware of the incident that caused Cathay Pacific to ground its fleet of Airbus A350 jets. It added it was committed to working closely with Cathay Pacific, Airbus (AIR.PA) and authorities conducting an investigation.\n\nThe news follows a significant drop in Rolls-Royce's market value, which saw £2.7bn wiped off on Monday when Cathay warned that \"a number of aircraft will be out of service for several days\". Rolls-Royce's stock has since rebounded 4.3% in early trading.\n\n“Cathay is only planning for the grounded aircraft to remain out of service for ‘several days’, suggesting the issue requires a fairly minor and quick fix, and therefore does not call into question the engine’s design or architecture like we saw with the Trent 1000. Indeed, Cathay has noted that spare parts have been secured and repair work is under way”, analysts at Morgan Stanley said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nShares in the EV maker were slightly lower ahead of the US opening bell despite reporting surging sales in China.\n\nTesla’s August sales in China saw a 37% jump from July, hitting over 63,000 cars, thanks mainly to a boost in smaller cities. Deliveries of its China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles rose 17% from July.\n\nHowever, its performance lags major Chinese rivals by a wide margin. BYD, the world's biggest EV maker, said its China passenger vehicle sales surged 35% in August from a year earlier to a record monthly high of 370,854. Other local EV competitors including Leapmotor and Li Auto also reported higher sales, according to Reuters.\n\nPreliminary data from the China Passenger Car Association estimated that the total sales of electric passenger cars in China last month rose 32% from a year earlier to about 1.05 million units, an 11% increase from July.\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nShares in Intel were just below the flatline after surging over 9% in the previous session after Reuters reported that the company is set to propose cost reduction measures.\n\nThe plan, which is expected to be presented in mid-September 2024, includes selling businesses such as the programmable chip unit Altera to reduce overall costs. The proposal does not yet include plans to split Intel and sell off its contract manufacturing operation, or foundry, to a buyer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSM), according to Reuters.\n\nRead more: Eurozone inflation drops to 2.2% and closes in on ECB target\n\nTo assist with the strategic review, Intel has hired financial advisors from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThis move is part of an effort to rejuvenate the chipmaker's financial performance. Intel has faced challenges as it seeks to regain its footing in the AI chip market, currently dominated by Nvidia.\n\nIts market capitalisation has fallen below $100bn following its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) sold off after the company's recent earnings report and are now down about 11% from their all-time high.\n\nNvidia is still posting excellent growth, with revenue up 122% in the quarter, ahead of analyst expectations. But with the stock exceeding a $3 trillion market cap and expectations extremely high, Nvidia sold off anyway following the release.\n\nOne reasons could be concern over the company's gross margin. Here's what happened with this all-important metric last quarter, and whether investors should be concerned about it.\n\nWhy gross margin is front and center for Nvidia and AI stocks\n\nAs the AI revolution took off, cloud computing companies and large enterprises clamored for as many of Nvidia's data center GPUs as they could get. The supply-demand mismatch enabled Nvidia to charge a premium for its chips, even as volumes grew. Hence, its gross margin expanded from a range between 55% and 65% \"pre-AI\" to a whopping 78.4% in the company's Q1 this year ending in April, while operating margin expanded from a range between 20% and 40% all the way up to 64.9% in the first quarter. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut as you can also see, gross and operating margin took a dip in the recently reported second quarter compared with Q1. Gross margin retreated to 75.1%, a decline of 3.3 percentage points, and operating margin declined to 62.1%. Meanwhile, on the conference call with analysts, CFO Colette Kress forecast gross margin of just 74.4% in the current quarter.\n\nThat could suggest a cooling of demand or pushback on price from large customers, who may be getting tired of paying through the nose for Nvidia chips. After all, investor concerns over cloud customers' getting a return on all of their AI spending is what led to the pullback in technology stocks this summer.\n\nBut Nvidia gave different reasons for the decline\n\nIn the release, Nvidia noted that the decline in gross margin was due to \"a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\"\n\nThat explanation should let Nvidia shareholders breathe a sigh of relief, at least for now. It has been known that Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip would be pushed back slightly, because of a manufacturing defect discovered late in the manufacturing and sampling process.\n\nOn the call, Nvidia noted that it made a change to the GPU mask at its foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), in order to improve manufacturing yields. Of note, this appears to be a minor tweak, as CEO Jensen Huang noted no functional changes were necessary to the chip. Still, it appears there were enough defects on the initial sampling ramp-up of Blackwell that Nvidia had to scrap a fair amount of chips from early production at TSMC.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's not clear how much of the decline in gross margin was due to inventory writedowns. But the remaining margin decline was attributed to a \"mix shift to new products.\" This is where things get murky. Nvidia's gross margin could continue to fall back to earth. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCan new products garner the same margin?\n\nIn chip manufacturing, newer products often take time to ramp up their yields, as the manufacturing process is perfected over time. But is the decline in Nvidia's gross margin due to lower initial yields in manufacturing, or is Nvidia increasingly limited in the premium it can charge for new products?\n\nMake no mistake: The current workhorse, the H200, is no doubt more expensive than the H100. However, newer products are also more complicated, and therefore expensive, for TSMC to produce.\n\nSo it's unclear if the remainder of the gross margin decline is due to lower initial yields, which eventually go higher as production ramps up, or if Nvidia, while charging more money for new products, can't maintain the same margin as the sticker price for newer chips go higher and higher.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia noted that 45% of its revenue comes from cloud service providers, all of whom are now pursuing their own in-house designed AI accelerators to lower costs. In addition, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), which isn't a cloud service provider but also probably accounts for a big chunk of Nvidia's revenue in addition to that 45%, has begun designing its own accelerators as well. And rival Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) forecasts above $4.5 billion in sales for its MI300 line of AI GPUs, which just came out this year and should keep Nvidia on its toes.\n\nAll of these companies, however, should continue to buy Nvidia chips. Nvidia still makes the most advanced neutral third-party GPU chip, and with developers already very familiar with its CUDA software, Nvidia should still see strong sales over the next few years.\n\nBut with all of its major customers now pursuing their own lower-cost self-designed alternatives and more competition incoming, Nvidia will have to compete that much harder. That can either come by staying a step ahead on the hardware side, or cutting prices -- or both.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia's investors need to keep an eye on gross margin, or perhaps model in some give-back in margin in the years ahead, even as revenue marches higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Hypergrowth Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With Up to 243% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Investors have been waiting decades for a new innovation or trend to come along that could do what the internet did roughly three decades ago for corporate America. After plenty of patience, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution appears to have answered the call.\n\nThe allure of AI is the capacity for software and systems to learn without the need for human intervention. This ability to evolve over time and become more proficient at assigned tasks, if not learn new skills altogether, gives the technology a limitless long-term ceiling. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn a span of less than 18 months, AI euphoria lifted Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) market cap by more than $3 trillion and necessitated a historic 10-for-1 stock split. But following such a monstrous run-up in Nvidia, some Wall Street analysts have turned their attention to other hypergrowth AI stocks that, in their view, offer up to 243% upside.\n\nHeadwinds are mounting for Wall Street's AI darling\n\nThough you'll find no shortage of Wall Street analysts who still see the potential for upside in Wall Street's AI darling, there's no denying that headwinds are beginning to mount for Nvidia.\n\nHistoric precedent is easily the biggest red flag. For 30 years, there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation or trend that's avoided an early stage bubble. This is to say that investors commonly overestimate the uptake and utility of new technologies. The fact that most businesses currently lack a clear plan as to how they'll use AI to grow their sales and increase their profits is a testament that artificial intelligence is likely in the next in a long line of early stage bubbles.\n\nBeyond history, it's impossible to ignore the external and internal competitive pressure Nvidia will have to contend with. Despite controlling an estimated 98% of graphics processing unit (GPU) market share for data centers in 2022 and 2023, Nvidia's piece of the pie is liable to shrink as new AI-GPUs enter the arena.\n\nMoreover, its four largest customers by net sales, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Even if Nvidia's AI-GPUs maintain their computing advantages, which is entirely likely, these four top customers are going to use their in-house chips as complements to Nvidia's hardware. This will reduce future opportunities for Nvidia to win valuable data center \"real estate\" from America's most-influential businesses.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin declined in the fiscal second quarter (ended July 28) for the first time in two years. AI-GPU scarcity has been fueling the company's pricing power and its rapid expansion of gross margin. But as this scarcity wanes, Nvidia's pricing power, and its gross margin, should fall.\n\nInstead of focusing on Nvidia, select Wall Street analysts see more prolific upside in the following two high-growth AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSnowflake: Implied upside of 93%\n\nThe first supercharged AI stock that at least one Wall Street analyst sees outpacing Nvidia is cloud-based data warehouse goliath Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW). Analyst Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs believes Snowflake can reach $220 per share, which would work out to a gain of roughly 93%, based on where it ended August.\n\nRangan added Snowflake to Goldman's \"Conviction List\" in July, with the belief that the company is ideally positioned for the next phases of the AI revolution -- i.e., the stage(s) where platforms and AI applications benefit most.\n\nThe lure for Snowflake has long been its superior growth rate and well-defined competitive advantages. Its infrastructure is layered atop the most-popular cloud infrastructure service platforms to eliminate data-sharing constraints for its clients.\n\nFurthermore, it's shunned the traditional subscription model in favor of a pay-as-you-go platform that charges clients based on how much data they store and how many Snowflake Compute Credits they use. There's little question that this cost transparency is resonating with its customers.\n\nUnfortunately, Snowflake's once jaw-dropping growth rate has cooled considerably. Year-over-year organic growth rates that surpassed 70% as recently as the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended July 31, 2022) are now below 30%. While the company has an impressive $5.2 billion backlog at its disposal, and it's continuing to add bigger fish to its client pool, the valuation premium it once commanded no longer makes sense.\n\nIn order for Snowflake to come anywhere close to Rangan's price target, it's going to need to meaningfully improve its adjusted profitability and stabilize its year-over-year sales growth in the 25% range.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 243%\n\nA second hypergrowth artificial intelligence stock with tantalizing upside, based on the forecast of one Wall Street analyst, is rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah sees Super Micro's shares eventually hitting $1,500, which would imply a more-than-tripling from where they closed on Aug. 30.\n\nLoop's price target on Super Micro is based on the company being well-positioned in the AI server market. Businesses wanting to gain a first-mover advantage in the AI space will be compelled to spend aggressively on the infrastructure needed to make that happen.\n\nWe've certainly seen evidence that demand for Super Micro's servers is incredibly strong. Following net sales growth of 110% in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30), the midpoint of the company's fiscal 2025 sales guidance ($28 billion) implies revenue growth of 87% in the current year. Despite Wall Street's consensus calling for north of $45 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026 (ended June 30, 2026), Super Micro is currently valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 10.\n\nThings seem almost too good to be true -- and they just might be.\n\nLast week, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research released a report that alleges, among other things, evidence of accounting manipulation at Super Micro Computer. This short-seller report was followed days later by Super Micro delaying the filing of its annual report. While this isn't an admission of wrongdoing, nor does it validate Hindenburg's findings, it does stir the pot at a sensitive time for the company.\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer has failed to live up to lofty growth expectations before. Aggressive sales growth forecasts during the initial cloud-computing boom in the mid-2010s weren't met. Considering what history tells us about next-big-thing innovations and the time they need to mature, skepticism appears well warranted with Super Micro, in spite of its historically cheap valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among ChatGPT’s Recent Stock Recommendations",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\n\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\n\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\n\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\n\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data—not too hot, not too cold—that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\n\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on  “historical trends” and the “market landscape” from various sectors which have “substantial” potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nConcerns have emerged regarding a potential delay in NVIDIA's product shipments due to a minor design issue, which could shift expected volumes from Q4 to Q1. To counter this, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is increasing production of its existing \"Hopper\" architecture to manage the impact. Despite these issues, demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips remains robust, with the company anticipated to continue its growth trajectory.\n\nArya believes that potential delays in NVIDIA's new Blackwell chip will be minor and not significantly impact overall demand, as NVIDIA’s existing Hopper products continue to be in high demand. The company's impressive financial performance includes a revenue of $30 billion, a 15% sequential increase and 122% year-over-year rise, surpassing expectations. The data center segment generated a record $26.3 billion, driven by demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Hopper architecture and GPU computing.\n\nAnalyst Vivant Arya highlights that, despite market volatility affecting semiconductor stocks, NVIDIA's strong fundamentals are intact. Major customers like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are increasing AI investments, suggesting continued demand for NVIDIA’s products. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor, a key supplier, has issued a positive outlook, and partner Supermicro expects 90% sales growth next year.\n\nLooking ahead, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expects Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, bolstered by ongoing growth in its data center business and Blackwell production. The company remains well-positioned to maintain strong margins and advance its next-generation products.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Is ‘Actually Very Cheap’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Must-Watch Stocks Today.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other must-watch stocks according to Jim Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer recently discussed Nvidia’s latest earnings report on Mad Money. Despite a solid quarter, the company did not exceed the high expectations set by investors and failed to deliver its key products quickly enough to sustain its previous extraordinary performance. This disappointment led to a relatively muted market reaction, with only modest movements in major indices.\n\n\"Turns out that the company is mortal after all. Even though it reported a great quarter last night, it wasn’t able to deliver its key product fast enough to allow the company to do what it’s done so many times before: blow away earnings and raise forecasts to unfathomable levels. The company didn’t define today’s trading because it failed to dazzle in the way that so many money managers had come to expect. The major indices didn’t move much—the Dow advanced 244 points, the S&P was basically flat, and the NASDAQ dipped just 0.23%.\"\n\nCramer expressed relief that the company’s quarter brought an end to the unrealistic expectations that had surrounded the stock. He emphasized that the company is not a miracle company but a firm specializing in high-performance chips that enhance productivity and problem-solving. Cramer noted that the market had unfairly elevated the company to a status where it was expected to perform miraculous feats beyond its actual capabilities.\n\n\"My response to all this? Goodness gracious! With this quarter’s results, the albatross of perfection is now gone; the millstone has been shredded. As much as I love the company, I’m thrilled that we can finally return to a market where there are many important stocks representing many important trends, rather than just one stock capturing the attention of legions of investors—many of whom have no idea what it does, let alone where it fits into the technological food chain.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that, in the end, the company isn’t a concept; it’s not a cult; it’s not a miracle maker. It’s a company that designs incredibly fast chips that enable rapid calculations to help companies speed up problem-solving and improve productivity. You can’t ask the company’s Blackwell chip to cure cancer or put a man on Mars, and it certainly can’t bring about world peace. Yet, when you look at how this stock was trading in recent weeks, the market was basically asking CEO Jensen Huang to do all these things and more.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe believes the company should be held as an investment, not traded based on fluctuating expectations. While acknowledging that the stock had become overvalued before the quarter, Cramer maintains his belief in the company’s value.\n\n\"Right now, it looks like the company can expand customer gross margins—important but not earth-shaking, especially since the enterprise is the client, not you; you won’t even see it. Now that this quarter is in the rearview mirror, my hope is that those who wagered on the stock, rather than invested in the company, will finally move on. No more exacting comparisons with AMD, please. We need to go back to a world where we value the company like any other company, with a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple based on its growth.\"\n\nJim Cramer also addressed the question of whether AI investments are yielding tangible returns, especially in terms of improving gross margins. He noted that many of the most convincing AI applications have taken time to develop. Early investment in AI often focuses on training models, and only after this stage can AI start delivering practical benefits. Cramer emphasized that AI's most significant impacts are typically in enterprise settings rather than for individual consumers.\n\n\"For the skeptics, the most compelling AI use cases have been slow to develop. Much of the early investment goes toward training AI models. Only after this process comes to fruition can artificial intelligence actually do something useful for users. It's important to note that most areas where AI is truly useful are enterprise-oriented.\n\nAs a consumer, you may not see how effective these models can be. Keep the term \"enterprise\" in mind, because it means it's not aimed at individual users. That’s why tonight I’m going to start something new: a running list of some of the best AI use cases we've heard about.\"\n\nTo highlight the progress in this area, Cramer is introducing a new feature: a running list of notable AI use cases. He pointed out that some AI applications have been in use for a while. For instance, OpenAI generates revenue from its ChatGPT offerings, with a free version available alongside paid subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus for $20 a month and more expensive options for businesses.\n\n\"Some of these have been around for a while. For example, there's a free version of ChatGPT, but OpenAI generates revenue from $20-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, as well as higher-priced offerings for enterprise customers. The same goes for Gemini and Claude, which have similar pricing. Microsoft's Copilot functionality and Adobe's Firefly tools have also been part of their broader product suite since late last year. Both are money makers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with notable growth potential. It also examines hedge fund perspectives on these stocks, ranking them from least to most owned based on hedge fund ownership.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) as a notable player in the chip industry, particularly in the artificial intelligence space. Although Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s chips are not as advanced as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s, they remain highly competitive. Cramer points out that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s stock is relatively inexpensive based on its 2026 earnings forecasts compared to other companies in the S&P 500.\n\n\"For example, how about AMD, which also makes chips, including chips for artificial intelligence? While not quite as useful as Nvidia’s, they’re still in the same league. Plus, AMD makes chips for traditional computing and servers that compete against a hobbled Intel. AMD’s stock is actually very cheap based on its 2026 earnings estimates compared to others in the S&P 500. And by the way, what happened to Nvidia was actually good for AMD. They’re a competitor, for heaven’s sake.\"\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands out as a promising investment due to its strong performance in the semiconductor sector, especially in data centers and AI technologies. In Q2 2024, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) surpassed revenue expectations, fueled by a notable 115% year-over-year growth in its data center business. This impressive increase underscores Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s effective expansion into AI-driven markets and its competitive edge over rivals.\n\nAdditionally, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems is set to boost its capabilities in AI chips, enhancing its position in the growing AI sector. Despite some recent stock volatility, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s shares have rebounded, indicating confidence in its long-term potential. With its ongoing innovation in AI and continued success in data centers, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is well-positioned for future growth.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's must-watch stocks today. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "This Risk Weighs on Investors' Minds as Nvidia Continues to See Explosive Growth. Is the Stock Still a Buy?",
        "content": "Over the past few years, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks, thanks to its astronomical growth. However, the stock fell after the chipmaker announced its fiscal second quarter earnings last week, despite incredible growth that surpassed analysts' expectations. The market wasn't impressed.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the company's latest quarterly results and the one risk that appears to be weighing on investors' minds.\n\nOutstanding revenue growth continues\n\nFor its fiscal second quarter, Nvidia saw sales soar 122% year over year to $30 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.68, up 152%. Now admittedly that was a slowdown from the 262% revenue growth and 461% adjusted EPS growth it saw in Q1, but still incredible growth.\n\nIts data center business once again led the way with revenue surging 154% to $26.2 billion. The company credited its growth to its Hopper graphics processing unit (GPU) computing platform, and in the quarter in began ramping up its newest H200 Hopper chip.\n\nGross margins fell sequentially as Nvidia scaled up its new Blackwell chips, but still remained a robust 75.1%. That was down from 78.4% in Q1.\n\nNvidia is also generating an enormous amount of cash, with operating cash flow of $14.5 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow came in at $13.5 billion.\n\nIt ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $26.3 billion. It also announced a new $50 billion share repurchase program.\n\nLooking ahead, the company guided for Q3 revenue of $32.5 billion, led by Hopper growth and the shipping of samples of its new Blackwell architecture. It called demand for Blackwell \"incredible\" and said that the transition to its next-generation architecture will be smooth, with demand for both Hopper and Blackwell chips expected to remain strong.\n\nNvidia noted that it did have to make a change to Blackwell to improve production yields but that it expects production to ramp up in the fourth quarter. It said no functional changes were necessary. Last quarter, it indicated production would ramp up in Q3. It is now expecting to recognize several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in Q4. This is good news and assuages fears that there could have been a longer delay.\n\nIt predicted that its data center business would continue to grow strong into next year and beyond. It noted that computing power for next-generation large language models (LLMs) would require 10 to even 40 times the computing power as the prior generation and that the need for more and more computing power would persist.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs now the time to buy the stock?\n\nDespite its spectacular growth, robust gross margins, and opportunities in front of it, Nvidia trades at a relatively modest valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 30 times next year's analyst estimates.\n\nGiven the need for ever-increasing computing power to train more complex AI models and the spending large tech companies are doing to advance AI, Nvidia appears to still have a long runway of growth in front of it. Combine that with a very reasonable valuation, and the stock looks like a buy.\n\nThe one big risk the stock faces and the question on many investors' minds is if all the spending on AI will result in a payoff for the companies doing the spending. Now, companies with cloud computing segments like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are seeing some benefits, and companies like Meta Platforms and Apple are also investing heavily in AI.\n\nHowever, these benefits will also need to trickle down to software companies that are developing AI applications and their customers. Right now, a lot of money is being spent on AI infrastructure to the benefit of Nvidia, but there is still an ongoing debate as to whether other companies will see these investments pay off. If they do not, then the spending on AI infrastructure could ultimately slow down significantly.\n\nSo while Nvidia continues to look like a buy, the one thing investors should really monitor is if software company growth can begin to increase due to AI. If these companies do not begin seeing growth ramp up in the next year or so, that could be the proverbial canary in the coal mine regarding Nvidia's valuation.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "content": "Tech giant Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been on a scintillating run over the past year, powered by AI-driven innovations catapulting its stock to breathtaking heights. However, following its rollicking performance for the better part of the year, we've seen NVIDIA stock take a much-needed breather. Nonetheless, with multiple catalysts powering its bullish momentum, particularly with its game-changing Blackwell processors, it's difficult to ignore Nvidia at any point in the AI race. The recent dip in Nvidia's stock price presents an excellent opportunity to buy into its growth story before a sustained rally fueled by upcoming interest rate cuts.\n\nSEE ALSO33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic\n\nFor those who've been out of the loop for the past couple of years, Nvidia is a front-runner in AI and accelerated computing markets. Its explosive success in AI infrastructure, driven by its cutting-edge AI chips like the H100 and the eagerly anticipated Blackwell processors, led to north of 140% gain in its stock over the past year alone. Moreover, as we look ahead, the booming demand for AI chips continues pushing Nvidia to even greater heights as the AI revolution moves past the genesis stage.\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nQ2 Results Were Encouraging\n\nNvidia investors soured over the company's Q2 results, dampening enthusiasm with a relatively soft Q3 guidance. However, investors accustomed to Nvidia's stellar performances quickly ignored another monstrous quarterly showing, marked by a 122% revenue increase to $30.04 billion, beating estimates by a whopping $1.30 billion.  Additionally, on the bottom-line, its net income surged 168%, driven by a roughly 155% increase in data center sales on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. However, the market punditry quickly pointed to a relatively sluggish 16% sequential growth from a previous 23%. Also, contracted from 78% in Q1 to 75% in Q2. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the relatively modest revenue guidance of $32.5 billion for Q3 fell short of expectations. Consequently, Nvidia stock dipped post-earnings and has been down more than 7% in the past week.\n\nBright Outlook Ahead\n\nDespite the supposed weak performance in Q2, Nvidia has plenty on its plate to continue growing rapidly. Based on analyst estimates, we could see the tech giant wrapping up the year with $125.50 billion in sales, a massive 105% jump from the last fiscal year. Moreover, its upcoming Blackwell architecture is touted as a major step up from previous iterations, which could significantly enhance AI performance and capabilities. The new platform integrates various advanced technologies, promising to outperform the current Hopper architecture dramatically. On top of that, the company is sitting on an enormous cash war chest, having generated more cash flow in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 than in all four quarters last year.\n\nMoreover, with Blackwell added to the mix, we could see a stunner of a Q4 this year for the company, kickstarting another rally. The bears will quickly point out the stock's lofty price metrics, trading more than 30 times, trailing twelve-month (TTM) sales. However, based on 2025 estimates, it trades at approximately 16 times its 2025 sales at $174.25 billion. Also, based on 43 Wall Street analysts, it attracts a Strong Buy Rating, offering a 27% upside from current price levels.\n\nNVDA is ranked 6th on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 179 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the second quarter which was 186 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger is set to present a strategic overhaul to its board of directors later this month, aimed at streamlining its operations and cutting costs, Reuters reported Monday.\n\nGelsinger is expected to outline a plan that includes divesting non-core businesses, including its programmable chip division, Altera.\n\nThe proposal will be presented at a board meeting scheduled for mid-September, the report said.\n\nReuters said the plan will not include proposals to separate and sell off Intel's foundry operations. The company's manufacturing and design divisions have already been separated in financial reporting since the beginning of the year to avoid conflicts of interest and to better serve external customers of Intel’s fabrication facilities.\n\nIntel is struggling to compete with industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) which dominates the AI chip market. Its market capitalization has plummeted below $100 billion following a disappointing second-quarter earnings report in August.\n\nIn a recent appearance at a Deutsche Bank conference, Gelsinger acknowledged the company’s challenges and reassured investors that Intel is actively addressing its issues. He emphasized that the company is entering the second phase of its turnaround strategy, with key decisions expected to be made in the upcoming board meeting.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel CEO to pitch board on plans to cut costs, sell chip unit - Reuters\n\nTesla's China-made EV sales in August up 3% yr/yr\n\nSaudi Arabia stocks lower at close of trade; Tadawul All Share down 0.18%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After reaching an important support level, Nvidia (NVDA) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. NVDA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nSimilar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.\n\nNVDA has rallied 11.3% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests NVDA could be on the verge of another move higher.\n\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 7 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Deciphering Nvidia (NVDA) International Revenue Trends",
        "content": "Did you analyze how Nvidia (NVDA) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending July 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\n\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n\nWhile delving into NVDA's performance for the past quarter, we observed some fascinating trends in the revenue from its foreign segments that are commonly modeled and observed by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter stood at $30.04 billion, increasing 122.4% year over year. Now, let's delve into NVDA's international revenue breakdown to gain insights into the significance of its operations beyond home turf.\n\nTrends in NVDA's Revenue from International Markets\n\nOf the total revenue, $3.67 billion came from China (including Hong Kong) during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 12.2%. This represented a surprise of +27.49% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $2.88 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $2.49 billion, or 9.6%, and $2.74 billion, or 20.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Taiwan contributed $5.74 billion in revenue, making up 19.1% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $5.75 billion, this meant a surprise of -0.23%. Looking back, Taiwan contributed $4.37 billion, or 16.8%, in the previous quarter, and $2.84 billion, or 21%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets\n\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that Nvidia will post revenues of $32.59 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 79.8% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan to this revenue are 10.1% and 19.1%, translating into $3.27 billion and $6.21 billion, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the full year, the company is expected to generate $122.19 billion in total revenue, up 100.6% from the previous year. Revenues from China (including Hong Kong) and Taiwan are expected to constitute 10.1% ($12.37 billion) and 18.4% ($22.46 billion) of the total, respectively.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe dependency of Nvidia on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\n\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\n\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating mechanism, demonstrates a notable performance history confirmed through external audits. It effectively utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions to act as a predictor of a stock's price performance in the near term.\n\nNvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating that it could perform in line with the broader market in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nNvidia's Recent Stock Market Performance\n\nOver the past month, the stock has gained 11.3% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's 4% increase. The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Nvidia is a part, has risen 4% over the same period. The company's shares have declined 1.3% over the past three months compared to the S&P 500's 8.2% increase. Over the same period, the sector has risen 5.2%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "NVIDIA's Data Center Sales Rise 154% in Q2: Time to Buy the Stock?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA just delivered a remarkable second quarter for fiscal 2025, with revenues surging to $30 billion — a 15% increase from the previous quarter and an astonishing 122% year-over-year growth. The company smashed its own guidance of $28 billion, driven by its data center segment, which contributed $26.3 billion to the total revenues.\n\nNVIDIA’s data center segment alone saw a 16% sequential rise and staggering 154% growth compared to the same period last year, propelled by the soaring demand for its Hopper graphic processing unit (GPU) computing and networking platforms. NVIDIA Corporation\n\nImage Source: NVIDIA Corporation\n\nThe AI Wave Fuels NVIDIA's Growth\n\nNVIDIA's dominance in the data center market is far from accidental. The company has capitalized on the explosive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Its Hopper architecture has already gained significant traction, and the upcoming Blackwell platform is expected to further boost revenues. Customers are rushing to adopt Hopper GPUs while eagerly awaiting Blackwell, indicating strong future demand.\n\nGenerative AI, in particular, has been a game-changer. The rise of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT has highlighted the immense value of AI in data processing, pushing enterprises to invest heavily in this technology.\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach nearly $1 trillion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032. NVIDIA, with its cutting-edge chips, is well-positioned to ride this wave. The company anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to hit $32.5 billion, driven by the growing AI investments in data centers.\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPU: A Revolution in the Making?\n\nNVIDIA’s upcoming Blackwell GPU platform promises to be a game-changer across various industries. Set to begin production ramp-up in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Blackwell combines GPU, central processing unit, data processing units, NVLink and networking chips, all powered by NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture software.\n\nThis platform is expected to revolutionize AI capabilities, positioning NVIDIA at the forefront of innovation. The company expects to rake in billions from Blackwell by the end of fiscal 2025, further solidifying its competitive edge in the AI market.\n\nNear-Term Hurdles: A Bumpy Road Ahead for NVIDIA?\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding Blackwell, NVIDIA faces potential challenges that could impact its stock in the near term. During its second-quarter earnings conference call, NVIDIA revealed that it is expecting to start ramping up the production of Blackwell in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and continue through fiscal 2026. However, it had earlier stated that the ramp-up of Blackwell production would begin in 2024. The latest update signals that the production ramp-up could now start by the end of January 2025.\n\nEarlier in August 2024, The Information had first reported that NVIDIA could encounter delays in delivering Blackwell chips. According to the report, these delays are due to design flaws and could set back delivery by three months or more, affecting major customers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Such delays could push potential customers toward competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, further denting NVIDIA's near-term outlook.\n\nAdding to the concerns, NVIDIA reported a sequential decline in its second-quarter non-GAAP net profit margin after eight consecutive quarters of growth. The margin, while up 6.5% year over year, contracted by 2.1% from the previous quarter, raising questions about the company’s ability to sustain its profitability.\n\nIs NVIDIA Stock Overvalued?\n\nNVIDIA's stock has been on a surge this year, up 141.1% year to date, outperforming both the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry and key competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology MU and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nYTD Price Return Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, this impressive performance has driven the stock's valuation to lofty heights. NVIDIA’s shares currently trade at a forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 19.81X, significantly higher than the industry average of 16.58X and well above its peers. By comparison, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron and Marvell trade at multiples of 7.99X, 4.27X and 10.08X, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Verdict: Avoid Buying NVDA Stock for Now\n\nWhile NVIDIA remains a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry with a compelling long-term growth story, current market conditions suggest caution. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s high valuation, coupled with potential delays in product rollouts, makes it less attractive for new investors at this time. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nFor those already holding the stock, it’s wise to stay put, as NVIDIA’s fundamental strengths and growth prospects are still intact. However, new investors might want to wait for a more favorable entry point, perhaps after a market dip, to avoid overpaying for future growth.\n\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA is still a dominant player, but the current landscape calls for a measured approach. It's a stock to hold but not necessarily to buy at this moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +11.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 12.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +80%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +112.3%. This estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.52 indicates a change of +27.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $32.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +79.8%. The $122.19 billion and $165.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +100.6% and +35.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $30.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +122.4%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.27 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.72%. The EPS surprise was +6.25%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a stock market star over the past few years, soaring alongside demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The company dominates the AI chip market, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) holding an 80% share. And this has helped revenue climb in the triple digits quarter after quarter. As a result, Nvidia stock has advanced more than 2,700% over the past five years.\n\nAnd Nvidia has a potentially big development just ahead. The technology giant is set to launch its new Blackwell architecture and chip later this year. The company expects to ramp up production in the fourth quarter and even generate major revenue from the platform. Should you buy Nvidia stock before this big launch? Let's take a look at what history says. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBlackwell's game-changing technologies\n\nFirst, let's consider why Blackwell itself is such an important development for Nvidia. This architecture is designed to run generative AI applications while consuming just 4% of the energy than Nvidia's earlier platform, Hopper. The total cost of ownership should follow suit with a drop in the same range. And Hopper will include six game-changing technologies, including the world's most powerful AI chip and high-performance networking, security, and reliability features.\n\nFor example, Blackwell's fifth-generation NVLink offers high-speed communication among as many as 576 GPUs. And the new Blackwell GPU holds 208 billion transistors -- there are 80 billion in Nvidia's current top chip, the H100. More transistors equals greater processing power, a major plus for customers launching generative AI projects.\n\nNvidia says demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and predicts this will continue into the next fiscal year. And investors won't have to wait long to see revenue emerging from this new platform. The chip designer expects \"several billion dollars\" of Blackwell revenue in the fourth quarter.\n\nWill Nvidia's shares take off following the Blackwell launch? The stock dipped recently, falling nearly 20% from the start of July through the early days of August. Still, it rebounded from that decline and is now heading for a 140% increase since the start of the year.\n\nWill Nvidia's momentum continue?\n\nCould the Blackwell launch keep the momentum going? Let's look at how Nvidia stock performed following the launches of its two previous architectures, Hopper and Ampere. Nvidia released Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020. In both cases, the stock rose by double digits in the three months following the launch -- 22% following the release of Hopper and 44% following the release of Ampere.\n\nBut there's no guarantee that history will repeat itself. And this brings me to the importance of long-term investing.\n\nNo matter what Nvidia stock does in the three months following the Blackwell launch, there are plenty of reasons to be positive about the shares over the long term. The company, which has promised annual updates to its chips, is likely to maintain its AI chip leadership. This should make it very difficult for rivals to unseat Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's big customers\n\nThe chip designer has also expanded well beyond the GPU, offering entire platforms for AI and selling its products through major cloud service providers. Many of the world's biggest technology companies, like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, rely on Nvidia's GPUs to power their AI projects. And all of this is happening in a high-growth environment. Market research firm MarketsandMarkets expects the AI market to expand from about $200 billion right now to more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia shares are trading for about 42 times forward earnings estimates. While this isn't dirt cheap, it's a very reasonable price for a company that's delivered so much growth in recent years and is likely to keep that momentum going thanks to its focus on innovation.\n\nSo even if Nvidia doesn't surge after the launch of Blackwell, the long-term picture remains bright -- and that makes it a fantastic stock to snap up today and hang on to for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "U.S. stocks closed the final week and the month of August with gains as optimism grew around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, following a favorable inflation report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9% last week (as of Aug. 30, 2024). The S&P 500 advanced 0.2% last week, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.9% (read: Tech ETFs That Won Amid NVIDIA-Led Tech Rout).\n\nNVDA Shares Slumped Despite Beating on Both Lines\n\nLast week, Wall Street witnessed the artificial intelligence (AI) king NVIDIA’s NVDA earnings, which put off investors’ enthusiasm. NVIDIA shares were off 7.9% last week. Nvidia's earnings, despite showing impressive growth, failed to meet the high expectations that fueled its recent rally.\n\nThe AI chipmaker's quarterly profit and revenue guidance topped estimates, but the magnitude of the beats fell short of the lofty hopes surrounding the stock. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $32.5 billion (+/-2%), above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.97 billion. Such almost in-line guidance also muted investors’ optimism.\n\nDelayed AI Payoffs?\n\nIn any case, the tech space has been showcasing subdued performance this earnings reporting cycle as many tech biggies have indicated delayed payoffs in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. So, investors remained in two minds before getting overly enthusiastic about renewed AI trades.\n\nU.S. Economy in Fine Fettle\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. economy grew in Q2 at a healthy 3% annual pace, fueled by strong consumer spending and business investment. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.9% annual rate last quarter, up from 2.3% in the government’s initial estimate, as quoted on CNBC. The second-quarter growth marked a sharp acceleration from a lackluster 1.4% growth rate in the first three months of 2024.\n\nUpdate on Inflation: July Prices Match Expectations\n\nInvestor sentiment was somewhat bolstered by the latest update on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which showed July prices meeting expectations. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% month on month, in line with forecasts. The annual core inflation rate of 2.6% matched June's level, slightly below the anticipated 2.7%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve closely monitors PCE inflation levels to gauge the need for interest rate adjustments. Following Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks signaling a forthcoming rate cut in September, market expectations for a 0.5% rate cut have increased, although a 0.25% cut remains a possibility due to steady price pressures observed in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest Leveraged ETFs of Last Week\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nDefiance Daily Target 1.5x Short MSTR ETF SMST – Up 19.7%\n\nProShares UltraShort Ether ETF ETHD – Up 19.6%\n\nProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF SBIT – Up 17.5%\n\nGraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF NVD – Up 15.2%\n\nT-Rex 2X Inverse NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDQ – Up 15.1%\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,000 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings.

But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in September, and 2 That Are Priced for Perfection and Worth Avoiding",
        "content": "Move over, artificial intelligence (AI)! Wall Street has a new hot trend, and its name is stock-split euphoria.\n\nA stock split allows publicly traded companies the ability to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. However, these changes are purely superficial and don't impact a company's market cap or its operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince 2024 began, 13 outstanding companies have announced and/or completed a stock split, including (all are forward-stock splits, unless otherwise noted):\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT): 3-for-1 stock split Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 10-for-1 Amphenol(NYSE: APH): 2-for-1 Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG): 50-for-1 Mitsui(OTC: MITSY)(OTC: MITSF): 2-for-1 Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM): 2-for-1 Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO): 10-for-1 MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR): 10-for-1 Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI): 1-for-10 reverse split Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS): 4-for-1 Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI): 10-for-1 Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX): 10-for-1 Sony Group(NYSE: SONY): 5-for-1\n\nAmong these top-notch stock-split stocks are two magnificent, inexpensive companies that are begging to be bought in September, as well as two highfliers that are priced for perfection and worth avoiding.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 that can be bought hand over fist in September: Sirius XM Holdings\n\nThe first phenomenal stock-split stock you can scoop up with confidence in September is the only company of the 13 listed above that's set to conduct a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings.\n\nWhereas most companies completing reverse splits are doing so from a position of operating weakness, this isn't the case with Sirius XM. Its roughly 3.85 billion outstanding shares have held its stock in the mid-single-digits for a decade, which might be a deterrent for some institutional investors who deem its low share price too risky. This reverse split will take place following the merger of Sirius XM with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group in a little over week, and likely make shares more attractive to big-money investors.\n\nWhat investors get with Sirius XM is easily identifiable competitive advantages. For example, it's the only licensed satellite-radio operator in the country, which affords it substantial subscription pricing power.\n\nSirius XM also generates its revenue differently than terrestrial and online radio providers. Instead of relying almost exclusively on advertising, as traditional radio companies do, Sirius XM has generated 77% of its net sales from subscriptions through the first-half of 2024. People are much less likely to cancel their service during periods of economic turbulence than businesses are to pare back to marketing budgets at the first sign(s) of trouble. In other words, Sirius XM is better positioned to navigate uncertain economic climates.\n\nStory continues\n\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 10, coupled with a dividend yield of 3.4%, makes Sirius XM stock quite the bargain for opportunistic long-term investors.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 to purchase with confidence in September: Sony Group\n\nThe other magnificent stock-split stock that's begging to be bought in September is none other than Japan-based electronics goliath Sony Group. Sony's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are set to undergo a 5-for-1 split on Oct. 8.\n\nEven though we're coming up on four years since Sony introduced the PlayStation 5, and it's perfectly normal to see gaming console sales taper off late in the cycle, Sony has found a couple of ways to boost one of its top revenue channels.\n\nFor instance, it's increasing the price of PlayStation 5 by about 19% in Japan to counter challenging economic conditions. It's also seeing strong subscription sales growth from PlayStation Plus, which allows subscribers to play games with their friends and store gaming data in the cloud.\n\nThough it's best-known for gaming, Sony Group is a diverse company. It's one of the primary suppliers of image sensors used in smartphones. With telecom companies upgrading their wireless networks to support faster download speeds, consumers and businesses have been steadily trading in their old devices for new ones that are 5G-capable. The 5G revolution is providing a healthy boost to Sony's Imaging and Sensing Solutions segment.\n\nA forward P/E of 16 is a fair (if not inexpensive) price to pay for a wonderful company that'll likely be introducing a new gaming console in about two years' time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe first stock-split stock to avoid in September: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not every stock-split stock is worth buying. Even though Nvidia has been the hottest megacap stock on the planet since the start of 2023, and its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is the preferred choice in AI-accelerated data centers, there are too many potential red flags to ignore.\n\nA point I've been trying to drive home for months is that there hasn't been a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend that's escaped an early stage bubble-bursting event in 30 years. This is a nice way of saying that investors always overestimate how quickly new innovations/technologies are adopted by consumers and businesses.\n\nThe simple fact that most businesses lack a defined game plan for their AI data center investments strongly suggests that we're witnessing the next in a long line of bubbles with AI. If and when the AI bubble bursts, I'd expect Nvidia's stock to be clobbered.\n\nCompetitive pressures can also no longer be ignored. Advanced Micro Devices is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is substantially cheaper than the H100, and doesn't face the same supply chain constraints as Nvidia's chips.\n\nBeyond external competition, Nvidia may lose out on valuable data center space from its top customers. The four members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that account for around 40% of Nvidia's net sales are developing AI chips of their own. Even with Nvidia's H100 and Blackwell chips almost certainly hanging onto their computing advantage, we're witnessing a concerted effort by America's most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware.\n\nNvidia's sequentially declining adjusted gross margin suggests we've witnessed the peak of the latest hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nThe second stock-split stock to shy away from in September: MicroStrategy\n\nThe other stock-split stock of the 13 that's worth avoiding in September is AI-inspired enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy.\n\nAlthough MicroStrategy is, technically, a software company, almost the entirety of its $27.2 billion market cap (as of this writing on Aug. 27) is derived from the Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) it holds. As of July 31, MicroStrategy held 226,500 Bitcoins, which is more than 1% of the entire supply that'll ever be mined. It also makes MicroStrategy the top corporate holder of the world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are lot of ways to wager on Bitcoin if you're a crypto optimist. However, buying MicroStrategy stock is, arguably, the worst possible way to do it. With Bitcoin trading at $59,338 per token, as of this writing, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin portfolio is worth $13.44 billion. Yet, its market cap of $27.2 billion (placing a fair value estimate on the software segment of around $1 billion), implies a value of roughly $115,650 per token. Investors are paying a 95% premium for its Bitcoin assets, which makes no sense.\n\nAnother reason to shy away from MicroStrategy has to do with how the company is financing its Bitcoin purchases. With minimal positive operating cash flow generated from its software segment, CEO Michael Saylor has overseen a number of convertible-debt offerings to fund its acquisition of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to enter a steep bear market, as it's done a couple of times over the last decade, MicroStrategy could struggle to meet its debt obligations.\n\nLastly, I'm not convinced that Bitcoin is in any way superior in the crypto arena. Its scarcity is based on lines of computer code that could, in theory, be altered with community consensus. Most importantly, Bitcoin's payment network isn't anywhere close to the fastest or the cheapest. It's a first-mover network that's been outdone by third-generation blockchain networks. MicroStrategy tethering its future to Bitcoin looks like a mistake I'd suggest avoiding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore’s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\n\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Even though the company beat market expectations on earnings per share and revenue for the second fiscal quarter, the shares fell following the report. This was because there were concerns around the production ramp for the latest AI chips called Blackwell and a slowdown in data center growth during the second quarter, raising concerns about valuation and future volatility. This selloff happened despite the fact that the firm outlined $50 billion in share buybacks. However, market experts are forecasting a shift to robotics that could be a future growth driver for the tech giant as the AI boom fades away.\n\nWall Street analysts expect NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to register parabolic growth in the coming months. Truist recently raised the price target on the stock to $148 from $145 and kept a Buy rating, noting that investors should look through the Blackwell fog and recognize that the company beat revenue and EPS expectations for the quarter and in the outlook, while the results and commentary reinforced leadership in AI as strong and persistent.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Good Fast Money Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other fast money stocks.\n\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\n\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\n\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\n\"That’s right. We’re not against rotation; we’re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don’t go down on bad news, we won’t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\n\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\n\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn’t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we’ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it’s really about earnings.\"\n\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\n\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\n\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today’s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today’s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\n\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it’s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed’s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPUs are essential for gaming, data centers, and AI, making the company well-positioned to benefit from the rising demand for high-performance computing. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s strong presence in AI is a major growth factor, as its GPUs play a crucial role in training AI models. With AI rapidly expanding across various industries, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands to gain from the increased need for its products.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI platforms, like NVIDIA AI Enterprise and Omniverse, further establish its leadership in this field. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s move into the automotive sector with its NVIDIA DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicles offers another promising growth opportunity. By collaborating with top automotive manufacturers and investing in autonomous driving technology, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to thrive in this emerging market.\n\nFinancially, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has demonstrated impressive revenue and profit growth, driven by its strengths in GPUs and AI, and its expansion into automotive and data centers. FQ2 2025 Revenue reached $30 billion, marking a 15% increase from the previous quarter and a 122% increase from the previous year, surpassing the expected $28 billion. Data center revenue hit a record $26.3 billion, up 16% from the previous quarter and 154% from the previous year, driven by high demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and networking platforms.\n\nHere's what the CFO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Colette Kress, has to say in their latest FQ2 2025 earnings call:\n\n\"Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell.\n\nKey workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA’s inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics.\n\nDevelopers desire NVIDIA’s rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going-forward.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Top Contender in the 5G Market According to Short Sellers",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n5G and AI Could be Catalysts of Global Digital Transformation\n\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that “AI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.”  This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\n\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\n\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\n\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nShort Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 1.12%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American tech company known for designing graphics processing units (GPUs) and software used in everything from gaming to AI. The company excels in high-performance computing and AI technologies.\n\nIts Graphics segment offers GeForce GPUs for gaming, GeForce NOW for game streaming, and Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstations, along with Omniverse software for metaverse development. The Compute and Networking segment includes data center computing platforms, networking systems, Jetson robotics, embedded platforms, and NVIDIA AI Enterprise solutions.\n\nNVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Aerial platform is advancing 5G and future 6G technology with a range of tools designed for both commercial and research use. The Aerial CUDA-Accelerated RAN helps build software-defined, cloud-native 5G and 6G networks using GPU-accelerated libraries for important network functions. This framework is flexible and can be extended with AI components to enhance performance.\n\nThe Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin allows for detailed simulations of 6G networks, from individual towers to entire cities. It includes realistic models and simulators to help researchers improve network algorithms and transmission efficiency.\n\nThe company’s Aerial platform also supports the development of virtualized 5G networks, which run on the company’s computing hardware to boost performance. Aerial allows data centers to run both 5G and AI applications at the same time, which makes them more efficient and adaptable. For researchers, it offers the 6G Research Cloud Platform and provides access to these tools through the cloud to support advanced 6G research and development.\n\nNVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were held by 179 hedge funds in the second quarter, at a combined stake value of $53.67 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the company’s biggest shareholder with 93.4 million shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30. It is our 6th best 5G stock to buy according to short sellers.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,00 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell leaves after a news conference at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., Dec. 14, 2022. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Think It's Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the market's most visible and influential battleground stock. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader posted second-quarter results after the market closed on Aug. 28 and posted performance that crushed Wall Street's targets. The business recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $0.68 on sales of $30 billion in the period, cruising past the average analyst estimate for per-share earnings of $0.64 on revenue of $28.7 billion.\n\nBut despite substantial sales and earnings beats in the quarter, Nvidia stock still lost ground following the report. With the company's share price losing ground on the heels of a blockbuster Q2 report, it's not unreasonable to wonder whether the red-hot AI leader may have finally hit its valuation peak.\n\nWhile the stock could continue to see some post-earnings valuation volatility, there's a good reason to think the stock can bounce back and continue climbing higher.\n\nNvidia's gross margins are holding up well and have a positive catalyst on the horizon\n\nThanks to AI-driven demand for the company's most advanced processors, Nvidia has been posting fantastic gross margins. The chart below tracks the business' gross margin over a three-year period concluding at the first quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year, which ended April 28, 2024. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith its recent report, Nvidia showed that it had recorded a gross margin of 75.1% in Q2 and also guided for a margin of 74.4% in fiscal Q3. For the full-year period, the company expects its gross margin percentage to be in the mid-70s. Based on the company's recent results and forecast, it looks like prices for its AI processors are coming down -- but not by much.\n\nNvidia's current top-of-the-line graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators are still showing very strong pricing power, and large tech companies are still buying hardware to improve their AI infrastructure. Selling prices for the company's current GPUs for advanced data center applications will likely continue to decline, but the AI frontrunner is gearing up to release its next major chip platform.\n\nNvidia has said that manufacturing of its next-generation Blackwell chips will ramp up in the fourth quarter, and it appears that the new processors are poised for release late in 2024 or early in 2025. With the company's current processors demonstrating resilient pricing power and a major leap forward in GPU technology on the horizon, the bull case for the stock remains intact.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks where investors appear to have taken an interest too late, most will probably think of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock has surged higher by more than 950% since late 2022, when it emerged as the dominant company for AI chips. Moreover, its fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings exceeded expectations, a result likely to keep the semiconductor stock's valuation in the stratosphere.\n\nNonetheless, the growth of the subsector it spearheaded, AI chips, is massive. Thus, investors should take a closer look at Nvidia to see if they are truly too late to capitalize on Nvidia's remaining growth potential.\n\nNvidia's phenomenal results\n\nMuch like previous quarters, Nvidia delivered impressive results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28). The company continues to benefit from solid demand for its Hopper chip and has begun shipping samples of its highly anticipated Blackwell chip to its customers and partners.\n\nGiven that demand, it may not surprise investors that Allied Market Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% for the chip market through 2032. This is far above the 6% CAGR Allied predicts for the overall semiconductor market through 2031.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia's results far exceed that forecast, as revenue came in at $30 billion. This was a 122% increase from year-ago levels and significantly above the $28 billion it forecast just three months ago. Furthermore, $26 billion of that revenue came from its data center segment, which includes its AI chips, and that climbed 154% year over year.\n\nAlso, net income for fiscal Q2 was nearly $17 billion, rising 168% from the same quarter last year as Nvidia limited the increases in the cost of revenue and operating expenses. Additionally, the company now anticipates $32.5 billion in revenue for fiscal Q3, indicating its massive growth will continue.\n\nMarket reaction\n\nNonetheless, despite the strong earnings report, the reaction of the market will likely make new investors nervous. The strength of the numbers was not enough to satisfy investors, and the stock fell following the news.\n\nMoreover, even with its huge growth, some of the valuation metrics may make investors reluctant to bid the stock higher, regardless of its circumstances.\n\nThis is not because of the P/E ratio, which, at 72, is surprisingly low given the stock's rapid profit growth. However, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 38 far exceeds other AI chip companies such as AMD at 10 times sales and Qualcomm at a 5 P/S ratio.\n\nThe contrast is starker when comparing the price-to-book value ratios. AMD and Qualcomm sell at 4 times and 8 times book value, respectively. This is a small fraction of Nvidia's price-to-book value ratio of 61! Considering such a valuation, one can see why investors may hesitate to bid Nvidia higher in the near term despite its incredible performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, this has occurred amid considerable share buybacks. Nvidia spent $15 billion on share repurchases in the first half of fiscal 2025. The company has also pledged an additional $50 billion for further share buybacks on top of the $7.5 billion remaining from the previous authorization.\n\nReducing the number of outstanding shares should mitigate the impact of any downtrends in the stock. Hence, the fact that investors have turned on the stock despite this bullish news may speak to how overvalued Nvidia stock has become.\n\nAre investors too late?\n\nGiven the state of the stock, investors should assume they are too late, at least for now.\n\nAdmittedly, the 38% CAGR in the AI chip market makes it likely Nvidia will benefit from robust growth for several years to come. If the stock goes into a bear market, investors should start dollar-cost averaging.\n\nUnfortunately, at its current price, it is priced for perfection or possibly priced beyond perfection when taking the fiscal Q2 earnings report into account.

        "title": "2 Monster Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "The growing $250 billion data center market is lengthening the growth curve for top semiconductor companies. The buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure will require major upgrades in processors and data storage components to build a new generation of AI-optimized data centers.\n\nHere are two leading chip stocks experiencing robust growth that can help you cash in on this lucrative opportunity.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe market for data center chips is exploding. The largest data center operators, or hyperscalers, are in a long-term process of upgrading semiconductors and components for AI, which requires extremely powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leading supplier.\n\nNvidia's revenue more than doubled year over year last quarter to $30 billion. The high margins these advanced chips command are also causing a windfall on Nvidia's bottom line, with earnings per share surging 168% over the year-ago quarter.\n\nNvidia's rate of growth will slow from these robust levels, but the outlook for GPU spending suggests it will grow at double-digit rates for several years. Dell'Oro Group projects the market for GPUs and other AI accelerators will grow at a 38% annualized rate over the next five years.\n\nComments from leading hyperscalers suggest these estimates are on the money. Meta Platforms is investing billions in AI infrastructure, including Nvidia GPUs, for its data centers. \"Our ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we've seen and expect to deliver in the future as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on our platform,\" CFO Susan Li said on Meta's Q2 earnings call.\n\nAlphabet's Google is another hyperscaler investing a fortune in AI technology. AI is mission-critical to its Google Cloud service, search algorithms, and recommendations on YouTube. Google believes the risk of underinvesting in AI infrastructure is far greater than the risk of overinvesting.\n\nIt's for these reasons Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's earnings to grow at high rates over the next several years. There will inevitably be ups and downs, as Nvidia's stock history as shown, but the payoff down the road is too great to pass up.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology's (NASDAQ: MU) memory and storage products will also benefit from the data center buildout. GPUs are the building blocks, but those high-powered processors are worthless if data centers don't have the capacity to store and retrieve data to train AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron is one of the leading suppliers of high-bandwidth memory modules and solid-state storage drives. The company's revenue can fluctuate from swings in memory pricing, but it's currently benefiting from the ramp in data center investment, as revenue jumped 81% year over year in the most recent quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Micron sees more favorable revenue trends, as demand for AI-enabled PCs and smartphones will kick in and benefit its business, too. Management's outlook calls for record revenue in fiscal 2025 (which ends in August 2025).\n\nThe stock hit a high of $157 this year before falling to its current share price of around $96. Wall Street is concerned that Micron and its competitors might over-invest in memory supply to meet demand, which could potentially pressure selling prices and revenue.\n\nHowever, Micron's annual revenue has been trending up for years. Training AI models will require growing amounts of data. This will continue to drive more demand for storage and memory bandwidth that will ultimately benefit Micron. An investment in Micron is basically a bet on the long-term growth of data consumption in the economy.\n\nThe best time to buy Micron stock is on the dip. Analysts expect earnings per share to reach $12.40 in fiscal 2026, which would be a new record for the company. Investors should expect the stock to move back toward its previous highs, implying 50% upside or more, within the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\n\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\n\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\n\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\n\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley believes custom silicon will become increasingly popular\n\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\n\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: ‘Buy Nvidia pullback,’ Apple named Top AI Pick",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nBuy Nvidia stock pullback - UBS, BofA\n\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to take advantage of the recent pullback in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares. Despite the AI giant’s quarterly forecast falling short of the lofty expectations set by investors, who have driven a massive rally in its stock on hopes for generative AI, analysts remain bullish.\n\nNvidia's shares dropped more than 6% on Thursday after the fiscal Q2 report was released. While the company reported significant growth and profit, the results were viewed as mixed, as revenue and gross margin projections didn’t surpass Wall Street's lofty targets as they had in previous quarters.\n\nUBS analysts, however, believe investors should “buy the pullback,” noting that key indicators for Nvidia remain bullish. The bank specifically pointed to the surge in Nvidia’s purchase commitments and supply obligations, describing this as “the most important metric we watch and a harbinger of future growth.”\n\nUBS analysts also expressed confidence in Nvidia's margins, stating they are not concerned about gross margins and expect data center margins to stay consistent through the Blackwell cycle, mirroring the stability seen during the Hopper cycle.\n\nSimilarly, Bank of America analysts reiterated their Buy rating on Nvidia stock following the report and raised the target price from $150 to $165.\n\nBofA acknowledged that the stock is “likely to be volatile” in the near term due to Nvidia’s projections missing elevated expectations, and noted that rising Blackwell ramp costs could impact Q3 margins.\n\nNonetheless, BofA remains confident in Nvidia’s long-term prospects, stressing that they “continue to believe in NVDA’s unique growth opportunity, execution and dominant 80%+ share as generative AI deployments are still in their first 1-1.5 years of what is at least a 3-4 year upfront investment cycle.”\n\n“AI deployment remains a mission-critical imperative for global cloud and enterprise customers, with NVDA providing the best turnkey model.”\n\nCiti moves Apple to Top Pick\n\nCiti analysts have elevated Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to their “top AI pick” for 2025, surpassing both Nvidia and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). This move comes as Apple gears up to unveil its iPhone 16 lineup at the “It’s Glowtime” product event on September 9th.\n\nAt the event, Apple is expected to introduce several key updates, including A18 chips utilizing the N3E process with an enhanced neural engine, improved camera and microphone features, and an upgraded modem for the Pro models.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Apple’s September event is generally all about hardware updates, but we believe the company will put a lot of focus on how the hardware updates for the iPhone 16 family can better support its Apple Intelligence features that are expected to roll out officially later in the fall,” Citi analysts remarked.\n\nLooking ahead, Citi expects a major refresh with the iPhone 17 next year, with AI features gradually being introduced over the coming year. This phased rollout is expected to give developers time to create apps and allow Apple to build customer recognition.\n\nCiti projects iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 unit sales to reach 85 million and 92 million in calendar years 2024 and 2025, respectively. Total iPhone units are expected to hit 228 million in 2024 and 241 million in 2025.\n\nThe analysts also highlighted that “AAPL stock on average outperformed the broader market since 2016 by 5%-6% over the period from June-quarter earnings date into the September iPhone release date.”\n\nAI bubble burst bigger concern than recession - BCA Research\n\nInvestors should be more concerned about the potential bursting of the AI bubble than a looming U.S. or global recession, according to strategists at BCA Research. The firm’s analysis suggests that the risks associated with the rapidly growing AI sector are more serious than those posed by broader economic downturns.\n\n\"When bubbles burst, the investment priority is to steer well clear of the bursting bubble plus sectors, regions, and countries heavily exposed to it.\" This implies that regardless of whether a recession follows the collapse of the bubble, the primary focus should be on avoiding the areas most impacted by the fallout.\n\nIn line with this, BCA Research advises investors to underweight U.S. tech and quasi-tech sectors, which are closely tied to the AI boom, and to reduce their exposure to U.S. equities within a global portfolio.\n\n\"Investors should worry much less about a U.S. or global recession than they should worry about the bubble in anything AI-related,” BCA noted.\n\nWith the AI sector continuing to attract significant attention and capital, BCA warns that the potential for a sharp correction poses a noteworthy threat.\n\nWilliam Blair starts Tesla coverage with a Buy rating\n\nWilliam Blair has initiated research coverage of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with an Outperform (Buy) rating, primarily driven by the underappreciated potential of Tesla's energy storage business.\n\nThe firm believes that Tesla Energy, particularly its Megapack and Powerwall products, could emerge as a significant growth driver, especially as expectations for the electric vehicle (EV) segment moderate in the near term.\n\n“We view Tesla Energy as the most underappreciated component of the Tesla story and expect the narrative will shift toward the energy storage business in light of tempered EV expectations in the near term.\"\n\nThe analysts highlight three key factors that make Tesla's energy storage business a compelling investment: the need for grid stabilization, the expansion of data centers, and the integration of renewable energy sources.\n\nThese aspects, alongside Tesla's broader automotive business and emerging opportunities in AI, robotaxis, and robotics, position the company as a technology leader with what William Blair describes as an \"Apple-esque ecosystem for the future of energy.\"\n\n\"Energy is the foundation for life, an abundance or lack of which determines how far society can reach on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\"\n\nTesla's approach to energy, through its more efficient EVs, energy storage solutions, and innovations like robotaxis and humanoid robots, aims to revolutionize how energy is created, stored, and utilized, with broad societal implications.\n\nWhile Tesla's current valuation may appear high by traditional metrics, William Blair argues that this premium is justified.\n\n\"Using traditional comparable analysis with auto or even tech, we understand the difficulty justifying the valuation, but in our opinion, this misunderstands the Tesla story.\"\n\nThey believe that the halo effect created by Elon Musk, the company’s culture of first principles, and its technological advantages warrant the valuation premium.\n\nCiti opens Positive Catalyst Watch on Marvell stock\n\nCiti analysts maintained their Buy rating on Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock with a $91 price target, based on an 18% higher-than-consensus CY25 earnings per share (EPS) following the July-quarter results.\n\nThe investment bank sees Marvell capitalizing on strong AI investments to rapidly expand its AI ASIC business, with four AI ASIC projects in the pipeline—two currently ramping up, one expected in 2025, and another in 2026.\n\nMoreover, Citi is adding a Positive Catalyst Watch ahead of next week's Technology Conference, where Marvell's CEO Matt Murphy will participate in a fireside chat.\n\n\"We expect management to sound bullish on AI growth exceeding prior 2024/25 AI sales targets and all non-AI end markets to recover in 2H24,” analysts wrote.\n\n\"MRVL stock typically outperforms when all its end markets move in the same direction,” they added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: ‘Buy Nvidia pullback,’ Apple named Top AI Pick\n\nMorgan Stanley updated its Dividend Equity Portfolio, dropped this big tech name\n\nWhat are implications of potential PlayStation 5 Pro launch on Sony's financials\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist After Its Latest Pullback",
        "content": "I was right about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). And I was wrong, too.\n\nEarlier this week, I predicted the stock would soar after its fiscal 2025 second-quarter update on Aug. 28 for three key reasons: blowout numbers, stellar guidance, and clarity on its Blackwell platform launch. Nvidia indeed reported blowout Q2 numbers. It provided stellar guidance. The company also gave more information about when it would begin shipping Blackwell.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's shares didn't soar despite all of this good news. Instead, the stock tumbled 6% lower the day after its Q2 update.\n\nShould investors buy Nvidia stock hand over fist after its latest pullback? Here are four reasons why the answer could be a resounding \"yes.\"\n\n1. Blackwell is coming soon\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress said in the company's Q2 earnings call that the Blackwell platform will ramp up production beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. She added that Nvidia expects Blackwell will generate \"several billion dollars\" of revenue in Q4. Kress mentioned that demand exceeds supply, a trend that should extend into next year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang clarified that Nvidia will begin shipping Blackwell in Q4. He touted Blackwell's capabilities and maintained that it's \"going to be a complete game-changer for the industry.\" Huang emphasized that Blackwell isn't just a graphics processing unit (GPU); it's \"an AI infrastructure platform\" that offers between 3 times and 5 times more AI throughput than Nvidia's Hopper platform.\n\nSome investors might have been disappointed that Nvidia missed its \"whisper\" earnings number in Q2 despite beating the official Wall Street estimates. However, I suspect the release of Blackwell will soon wipe away those misgivings.\n\n2. The $1 trillion data-center migration\n\nIt's important to keep in mind why Blackwell and forthcoming innovations are so critical to Nvidia's success. A massive migration of data centers from CPUs to GPUs is underway. As Huang said in the Q2 call, \"$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.\"\n\nDon't look at this as an opportunity for Nvidia that's well into the future, though. Huang noted that the company expects its data-center business will grow \"quite significantly next year.\"\n\n3. The next generation of generative AI is at hand\n\nOne reason why data centers need powerful GPUs is that the next generation of generative AI is at hand. According to Huang, \"The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software.\" He noted that Nvidia is already using generative AI coding \"quite extensively.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while the use of generative AI in coding, chatbots, and image generation is accelerating, Huang argues that's \"just the tip of the iceberg.\" He mentioned several other areas that generative AI is transforming, including ad targeting, large-scale recommender systems, robotics, and search systems.\n\nImportantly, training next-generation AI models will require 10 times to 20 times more computing power. This creates a huge growth market for Nvidia, one the company is capitalizing on.\n\n4. Nvidia plans to buy its shares hand over fist\n\nThere's at least one other reason to buy Nvidia stock after the recent pullback: The company plans to buy its shares hand over fist. Nvidia's board of directors approved a $50 billion stock-buyback authorization. This comes on top of the $7.5 billion remaining on the existing share-repurchase authorization.\n\nSure, the total amount of authorized-stock buybacks represents less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap. However, the increased authorization underscores that the board believes in the company's future growth prospects. With Nvidia prepared to bet another $50 billion on itself, it could give investors putting up much less money to buy the stock with more confidence in their decision.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

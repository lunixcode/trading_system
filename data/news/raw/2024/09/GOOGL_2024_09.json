According to Pew Research Center in 2020, 17.9 million international migrants traced their roots back to India, surpassing Mexico's 11.2 million and Russia's 10.8 million. As per The Economic Times Indian migrants are spread worldwide, with the largest populations in the UAE (3.5 million), the U.S. (2.7 million), and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million).

In contrast, the UK's 4.7 million migrants made up 7.6% of its population, and Mexico's 11.2 million migrants accounted for 8.2%.\n\nAccording to the report by The Hindu, India was the top country receiving remittances in 2010 ($53.48 billion), 2015 ($68.91 billion), and 2020 ($83.15 billion).

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc. (\n\nNASDAQ:GOOG), guides the company with creativity and a clear vision, constantly pushing boundaries and fostering innovation. Satya Nadella, a prominent figure in Silicon Valley, leads Microsoft Corporation (\n\nNASDAQ:MSFT) in reshaping how the world interacts with technology.

These leaders are at the forefront of technological advancement and smart business practices, shaping the world for future generations. Their achievements highlight the global influence of Indian professionals and the growing trend of Indian immigration.\n\nOn September 24, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai delivered a lecture titled \"The AI Platform Shift and the Opportunity Ahead\" at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as part of their President’s Lecture Series (Google Blog). In his talk, Pichai emphasized the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors and highlighted the vast opportunities it presents for innovation and societal advancement.\n\nDuring the lecture, Pichai discussed how AI is accelerating scientific discoveries, enhancing access to information, and driving economic progress. He also addressed the challenges associated with AI, such as the potential for deepfakes and the importance of implementing balanced regulations to ensure AI benefits are equitably distributed. This event at CMU aligns with Pichai's ongoing efforts to promote AI education and responsible innovation. Notably, CMU has a longstanding relationship with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), having hosted the company's first Pittsburgh office and collaborated on various research initiatives.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "title": "Epic Games sues Google and Samsung over phone settings, accusing them of violating antitrust laws",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Video game maker Epic Games sued Google and Samsung on Monday, accusing the tech companies of coordinating to block third-party competition in application distribution on Samsung devices.\n\nAt issue is Samsung's “Auto Blocker” feature, which only allows for apps from authorized sources, such as the Samsung Galaxy Store or Google Play Store, to be installed. The feature is turned on by default but can be changed in a phone's settings. The tool prevents the installation of applications from unauthorized sources and blocks “malicious activity,” according to Samsung.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court — Epic's second against Google — the company said Auto Blocker “is virtually guaranteed to entrench Google’s dominance over Android app distribution.” Epic, developer of the popular game “Fortnite,” filed the suit to prevent Google from “negating the long overdue promise of competition in the Android App Distribution Market,” according to the complaint.\n\n“Allowing this coordinated illegal anti-competitive dealing to proceed hurts developers and consumers and undermines both the jury’s verdict and regulatory and legislative progress around the world,” Epic Games said in a post on its website.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Samsung said it “actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly.”\n\n“The features integrated into our devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users’ personal data. Users have the choice to disable Auto Blocker at any time,” Samsung said, adding that it plans to “vigorously contest Epic Game’s baseless claims.”\n\nEpic launched its Epic Games Store on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide in August. The company claims that it now takes “an exceptionally onerous 21-step process” to download a third-party app outside of the Google Play Store or the Samsung Galaxy Store. But a support page on Epic's website shows a four-step process to remove the Auto Blocker setting.\n\nEpic won its first antitrust lawsuit against Google in December after a jury found that Google’s Android app store had been protected by anti-competitive barriers that damaged smartphone consumers and software developers.\n\nThe game maker says the “Auto Blocker” feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the jury’s verdict in that case.\n\n“Literally no store can compete with the incumbents when disadvantaged in this way,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said on X. “To have true competition, all reputable stores and apps must be free to compete on a level playing field.”\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Dominating AI and Cloud Markets with $50 Billion Investment Strategy",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Major Stocks to Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other best major stocks to invest in according to analysts.\n\nThe Post-Fed Rate Cut Opportunities\n\nThe current economic landscape presents a mix of signals as market participants assess the necessity of additional interest rate cuts. Despite overall economic strength, the Fed has hinted at potential rate reductions due to weaknesses in specific sectors. Currency dynamics are also shifting, with the US dollar weakening against the euro, adding another layer of complexity to the market environment. Amidst this backdrop, major stock indices, including the Dow Jones, continue to hover near record highs.\n\nAs analysts and market participants navigate these developments, they must consider how these factors may influence investment strategies in the coming months. Recently, discussions have emerged regarding the implications of potential rate cuts and their effects on various sectors of the economy. Some experts argue that further cuts may be necessary to support smaller businesses and consumers who are still adjusting to previous interest rate hikes.\n\nStephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hightower thinks that a soft landing for the economy despite market volatility is anticipated, which is a contrasting perspective amidst market volatility and uncertainty. While there are concerns regarding the performance of small-cap stocks and their ability to keep pace with larger assets, she thinks the economy may stabilize without entering a recession. We talked about this in more detail in our article on the 10 Best Young Stocks To Buy Now, here’s an excerpt from it:\n\n“….She believes that the Fed is skillfully guiding the economy towards a soft landing, even amidst the expected market fluctuations before the elections.\n\nJust 3 weeks ago, the S&P 500 had dropped by 4%. Still, it rebounded by 4% the following week. It rose another 1% last week, reaching new highs, and expressed optimism about buying opportunities during any market weakness, citing better-than-expected economic growth driven by recent data, including improved retail sales and manufacturing figures, as well as a decline in weekly jobless claims to a 4-month low. This positive economic backdrop supports an estimated growth rate of 2.9%, which is expected to benefit corporate earnings.\n\n….Link noted a broadening market trend over the past couple of months, indicating that while tech has taken the lead, other sectors such as financials, industrials, materials, and discretionary stocks are also showing strength.”\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Stoltzfus from Oppenheimer Asset Management joined CBNC’s ‘Squawk on the Street’ on September 25 to discuss the difference the Fed’s recent rate cut makes. It was highlighted that the S&P 500 is experiencing a remarkable moment, having just achieved its 41st record close of the year. Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist has set a target of 5,900 for the index, attributing this optimistic outlook to the recent rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nStoltzfus explained that the significance of these cuts lies in their actual implementation after a long period of rate hikes and pauses. He described the rate cut as a down payment from the Fed to both Wall Street and Main Street, signaling that further cuts could be on the horizon if necessary. Since this announcement, the market has shown mixed reactions, with defensive stocks performing well at times while technology stocks have also seen gains.\n\nWhen discussing consumer discretionary stocks, Stoltzfus expressed that this sector is one of their favorites despite its underperformance earlier in the year. He noted that there has been a noticeable improvement in performance over recent months as investors recognize consumer resilience. However, he emphasized that within consumer discretionary, investors should focus on select companies rather than expecting a broad rally across the sector. Retailers leveraging e-commerce effectively are likely to perform better during the upcoming holiday season.\n\nThe conversation also touched on concerns regarding discounts in various sectors, particularly electronics. Stoltzfus acknowledged that value has become a key focus for consumers, which has led to increased competition among retailers. This competition allows consumers more options but may also pressure profit margins for some retailers. Nonetheless, he pointed out that many businesses within consumer discretionary, beyond just retail, are likely to maintain healthy margins.\n\nStoltzfus’ discussion highlighted the positive impact of the Fed’s rate cuts on market sentiment and consumer behavior while recognizing challenges in specific sectors. The outlook remains optimistic as investors navigate through these transitions and prepare for potential opportunities in consumer discretionary stocks and other sectors.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe used stock screeners to look for mega cap stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks with the highest upside potential (more than 15%), that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 26.68%\n\nMarket Cap as of September 26: $1989.17 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational technology conglomerate holding company, best known for its subsidiary, Google, focusing on technology-related products and services, including internet search, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, hardware, and software development, and is known for its innovative products, strong brand recognition, and commitment to advancing technology.\n\nGoogle maintains a dominant position in the search engine market, with approximately 91.06% market share, and is continually improving Gemini and developing AI hardware.  While Google’s TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) only hold about 20% of the market, their advancements promise increased market share. Additionally, Google’s 6th generation chips are 67% more energy efficient than their predecessors.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI, with plans to spend $50 billion by the end of 2024. Its strong competitive advantages, including its algorithms, AI expertise, and valuable data access, position it well for future growth in this segment. Over 60% of GenAI startups and 90% of GenAI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is anticipated to reach $100 billion in combined revenue from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In Q2, Google Cloud revenue grew 28.8%, contributing to an overall revenue increase of 13.59%.\n\nIts Waymo division is a major player in the autonomous driving industry, with 700+ cars operating in San Francisco alone. It has faced criticism for incidents like fires, crashes, and traffic violations. Despite these challenges, Waymo offers robotaxi services and has reported providing 100,000 rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\n\nThe company’s strong competitive advantages, including its AI expertise and valuable data, combined with its dominant position in search and mobile, make it a leading beneficiary of the growing AI market. Alphabet’s focus on innovation and cost efficiency positions it for long-term success.\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of best major stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Brad Gerstner on Alphabet (GOOG): Management Should ‘Tighten the Belts’ and Get Ready for the ‘Battle’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.\n\n“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\n“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.\n\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Brad Gerstner Altimeter Capital\n\nBrad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBrad Gerstner’s Stake: $122,865,640\n\nWhen ChatGPT started making waves, Brad Gerstner became one of the top voices calling the AI revolution a threat to Google’s search business. However, he has grown bullish on the company over the past few months. Talking about this change during a program on CNBC, the investor said he still believes the future of search is not “ten blue links” but praised the company’s efforts to change.\n\n“They have got to tighten the belts and get ready for this battle because this is a different battle than the one they’ve been fighting for the last decade. They were dominant in ten blue links. They are not dominant in this. There are a lot of other players in the age of AI,” he said.\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.3 billion and $325.85 billion estimates indicate +14% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the founder of this Google rival after investing in his startup",
        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nHungry upstarts don’t always get the attention of major players, but in the case of You.com, founder Richard Socher got a front-row seat with Nvidia’s Jensen Huang.\n\n“I was extremely impressed with Jensen,” Socher told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (above video; listen in here).\n\nHis AI-powered search engine recently announced a $50 million Series B round with investors including Nvidia (NVDA), Salesforce (CRM) Ventures, and DuckDuckGo. The capital raise valued the Google (GOOG) and Yahoo rival at close to $1 billion.\n\nSocher said he met with Huang for nearly two hours around the time of the investment, discussing topics ranging from history to running a business.\n\n“I don’t generally get nervous with most people, but it was very impressive to hear him giving advice,\" Socher said.\n\nDuring his conversation, Socher says Huang shared that “he focused a lot on the speed of Nvidia\" during its early years.\n\nEventually, Nvidia opted to pivot a little to gain focus.\n\n“At some point, they realized that the best way is to focus on gaming first and really dominate that niche,” Socher said, adding that Huang suggested staying focused on You.com's mission of being an AI-powered alternative to Google.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Socher and Nvidia have crossed paths.\n\nIn the early 2010s, his research group at Stanford utilized Nvidia GPUs. At that time, Nvidia mostly sold GPU products to the graphics sector. “Nvidia was like, ‘who are you? Why are you trying to buy our GPUs,’” said Socher, noting that GPUs now assist with the company's AI workloads.\n\nNvidia launched in 1993 — born from Huang's scribbling on a napkin at a Denny's — to develop 3D graphics for gaming and multimedia purposes. Back then, an increasing number of consumers were taking the computing plunge, leading to demand for higher-powered computers.\n\nSix years later, Nvidia introduced graphics processing units (GPU), and in 2012, it brought AI to the forefront by introducing the AlexNet neural network.\n\nThis summer, Nvidia introduced an initiative that would bring generative AI to a wider audience using its latest GPU technology. The company's AI chips are seen as having a wide performance lead over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), leading to impressive financial results over the past two years.\n\nNvidia's second quarter sales and earnings rose 122% and 152%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nAfter a summer pullback following mixed third quarter guidance, Nvidia is now the third most valuable company in the world. It sports a market cap of $2.98 trillion, while Microsoft sits at $3.18 trillion and Apple stands at $3.46 trillion, according to Yahoo Finance's comparison tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date, shares are up 145% compared to an 18% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Another big media merger has finally been confirmed.\n\nSatellite TV provider DirecTV (T, TPG) said Monday it will buy rival Dish Network (SATS), including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. Financial terms were not disclosed.\n\nThe deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is set to create one of the nation's largest pay-TV providers.\n\n\"The combination of DirecTV and Dish will benefit US video consumers by creating a more robust competitive force in a video industry dominated by streaming services owned by large tech companies and programmers,\" the companies said in a joint statement.\n\nShares in EchoStar, which owns Dish Network, moved about 1% higher in premarket trading following the news, although the stock had surged nearly 10% on Friday after the acquisition rumors intensified.\n\nMonday's deal confirmation represents a full circle moment after both companies discussed a possible combination more than two decades ago.\n\nIn 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) blocked a proposal to merge the two entities, citing antitrust concerns. But it's a much different environment this time around as subscriber losses have accelerated and more consumers cut the cord in favor of less expensive streaming services.\n\n\"It’s hard to imagine that regulators would block a deal,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote in an email to clients prior to the deal's confirmation. But the analyst also warned that \"synergies would likely be much more limited than you might imagine.\"\n\nHe referenced the companies' vastly different satellite portfolios, which he argued would not be “remotely worthwhile” to reconfigure in order for them to match.\n\n\"The biggest synergy would once have been to eliminate churn associated with customers moving back and forth between the two companies,\" he said. \"But today they each capture so few gross additions that cutting them, potentially even in half, wouldn’t amount to much.\" Satellite TV provider DirecTV said it will buy rival Dish Network, including Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, through a debt exchange transaction. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) (Mike Blake/ REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nStill, the deal will help aid EchoStar's heavy debt load while also helping cut costs for the owners of DirecTV. AT&T spun off DirecTV in 2021, moving it into a joint venture with private equity investor TPG. At the time, it was valued at about $16 billion with the telecom giant taking a $15.5 billion impairment charge in 2020 to account for subscriber losses.\n\nDirecTV was dealt yet another blow after it lost its coveted Sunday Ticket package to Alphabet's YouTube TV (GOOGL, GOOG) in late 2022.\n\nAmid those struggles, AT&T revealed on Monday that it would sell its entire 70% stake to TPG for $7.6 billion in a move that allows the telecom operator to fully exit the TV business. The company previously had agreed to hold onto its stake in DirecTV for a three-year period, which expired on July 31.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transaction, which the company said allows it to strengthen its balance sheet and focus on wireless 5G and fiber connectivity, is expected to close in the second half of next year.\n\n\"It’s hard to argue that a merger [between DirecTV and Dish] shouldn’t happen; it clearly should. Consolidation during a period of secular decline is always to be expected,\" Moffett said in his note. \"But it would be a mistake to overestimate its importance. Adding a year or so to the expected life of satellite TV isn’t going to change the narrative for programmers, distributors, or even for satellite TV.\"\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analysis-Google ad tech trial outcome no death blow, win or lose",
        "content": "By Kenrick Cai\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - As Google's trial on allegations of building an illegal monopoly in advertising technology nears its close, experts said the financial risk of losing the case is minimal for the tech giant best known for its search engine.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of states accuse the Alphabet unit of illegally monopolizing markets for the technology that publishers and advertisers use to buy and sell ads on websites.\n\nGoogle rested its case on Friday. Closing arguments are scheduled for Nov. 25 and a ruling is expected in the coming months.\n\nThe trial began one month after a U.S. judge ruled on Aug. 5 in the DOJ's favor that Google had illegally cornered the online search market. Remedies in that case could be proposed as soon as December, while Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Evercore ISI lowered its price target on Alphabet stock to $200 per share from $225, citing \"probable medium-term uncertainty\" around remedies to the search case, which could include breaking up pieces of business like Google's Android mobile device operating system.\n\nCompared with the potential business implications around the search case, the ad trial is a mere flesh wound, analysts said.\n\n\"The search case is the one that has the meat in terms of how much it could affect the business. This case is more headline,\" said Scott Devitt, an analyst at Wedbush.\n\nAdvertising accounted for more than 75% of Google's $307.4 billion in revenue for 2023.\n\nBut the Justice Department's case revolves around Google Network, a division of the business that manages its auction-style system that advertisers use to purchase digital ad space.\n\nThe Network business comprised $31.4 billion of the company's revenue last year, down from $32.8 billion the year prior. A September analyst note from Bernstein predicted that revenue in this segment would decline further over the next three years.\n\n\"As an investor, you buy Google stock because you believe in the search business,\" said Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik. \"The network business is there, but for the last several quarters it's been declining in revenue contribution. It feels like the old internet.\"\n\nThat theme has been key in Google's defense at the ad tech trial, where it has argued that the DOJ's market definition fails to account for ads on streaming video and apps, where Google faces stiff competition.\n\nGoogle declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking, at a minimum, the divestiture of Google Ad Manager, a platform within the Network division.\n\nStory continues\n\nAd Manager represented 4.1% of overall revenue and 1.5% of operating profit in 2020, according to Wedbush research and analysis of court documents.\n\nMore recent figures were redacted from court documents.\n\n\"Even if Google loses the ad tech case and gets broken up, it probably would not have to divest all parts of its display advertising business - only some parts,\" said Erik Hovenkamp, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"I would expect its revenues to fall by less than 10%.\"\n\nIndeed, Reuters first reported on Sept. 18 that Google itself offered to sell its advertising exchange, which is part of Google Ad Manager, to appease European antitrust regulators. Publishers rejected the proposal, sources said.\n\nRIPPLE EFFECTS\n\nIf Google loses the ad tech trial, the most serious implication might be how the company manages the ripple effects of court-ordered remedies across other parts of its ad tech suite, said Nikolas Guggenberger, a law professor at the University of Houston. In theory, a DOJ win would make it easier for advertisers and publishers to switch ad tech platforms.\n\nAs such, Google's interest in specific products in the Network division has less to do with their individual monetary value as with their contribution to the interconnected chain of its overall ad business, he said.\n\nThe Justice Department is arguing that this chain is at the heart of Google's ability to establish a monopoly.\n\n\"The analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE,\" wrote Jonathan Bellack, a former Google product director, in an internal email the DOJ cited in pretrial court filings.\n\n\"You have an informational advantage over all other market participants because you know which bets are being brought together, so you can behave strategically,\" Guggenberger said.\n\nGoogle’s critics say the case could have ramifications beyond advertising or financials, namely in setting precedent for monopolistic behavior in general.\n\n\"That precedent will have a domino effect showing that governments can and do hold tech giants accountable when they break the law,\" said Sacha Haworth, executive director of The Tech Oversight Project.\n\nGuggenberger cautioned it's too early to predict the extent of impact, which would be contingent on a court ruling in favor of the DOJ, the resultant remedies and Google's execution of its restructure.\n\n\"I can see a world in which long-term profits barely take a hit, and I can see a world in which it upends the whole advertisement stack,\" he said. \"I'm just not sure what probabilities I would assign to them.\"\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google plans to invest $1 billion to build data centers in Thailand, joining global tech companies in adding cloud and AI infrastructure in Southeast Asia.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\n\nThe company will add facilities in Bangkok and Chonburi, a province southeast of the capital. The outlay could help add $4 billion to Thailand’s economy by 2029 and support 14,000 jobs annually over the next five years, Google said Monday, citing a Deloitte study.\n\nThe investment was unveiled by Google and Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thailand’s recently appointed prime minister, underscoring the push by Southeast Asia’s governments to attract foreign tech firms. Long seen as a tech hinterland, the region of about 675 million people is fast emerging as a growth opportunity for Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., which are spending billions of dollars to ramp up AI data centers from Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore and Indonesia.\n\n“We are investing in cloud regions, data centers and subsea cables across the region, building on our many years of work to bring cloud infrastructure closer to the people and organizations here,” Alphabet Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat said in an emailed response to questions ahead of an event with the prime minister in Bangkok. “This region holds great potential.”\n\nGoogle has already announced billions of dollars in investment in Malaysia and Singapore this year. Amazon unveiled a $9 billion outlay in Singapore in May, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella swung through the region unveiling a road map involving expenditures of about $4 billion to build data centers and other infrastructure.\n\nGovernments around the world are trying to strike a balance between ensuring digital sovereignty and luring foreign investment. They are seeking to keep control of their citizens’ data and develop local tech firms, while leveraging global companies’ investment power and expertise to build AI and cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe new Thailand data center capacity will help support Google’s AI-driven services such as search, maps and workspace. The company set up in Thailand 13 years ago, and says it has trained over 3.6 million students, educators, developers and small and medium businesses in digital skills in the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle’s investment is aligned with the country’s cloud policies, Paetongtarn said in a statement.

        "title": "Biden’s Antitrust Cop Got a Big Win. Will It Be His Last?",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hetal Doshi sprinted down the marble hallway on the fourth floor of the Justice Department’s antitrust division last month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion NJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\n\n“We won! We won! We won!” she shouted, bursting into a wood-paneled conference room where Jonathan Kanter, the assistant US attorney general for antitrust, sat talking with a team of young lawyers. Doshi, Kanter’s head of litigation, embraced him.\n\nKanter paused. “What did we win?”\n\nMinutes earlier, a federal judge in Washington had ruled that Alphabet Inc.’s Google had illegally monopolized the market for online search and search advertising. The decision marked the US’s most significant victory in a monopoly case since its initial triumph over Microsoft Corp. more than two decades ago.\n\nFor Kanter, a 51-year-old lawyer brought in to the Biden administration with a mandate to restore competition in Corporate America, it was a moment to savor — a crowning achievement for an antitrust revival that has sought to show that laws first enacted to rein in 19th century business titans apply to 21st century technology juggernauts.\n\n“No company, no matter how big or how influential, is above the law,” Kanter said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Antitrust laws apply today just as much as they did the day they were written.”\n\nKanter and Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, have led one of the most confrontational chapters in recent US regulatory history — and become targets for industry leaders who say the Biden administration has been too aggressive in overseeing business. Kanter says that competition is good and necessary for free markets.\n\nIn the three years since Kanter took his post, the Justice Department has accused bellwether US companies of illegally dominating markets for digital advertising (Google), smartphones (Apple Inc.), concert tickets (Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s Ticketmaster) and debit cards (Visa Inc.). It has also blocked numerous mergers, frustrating executives, bankers and investors.\n\nBarak Orbach, a professor at the University of Arizona law school, said he was wary of Kanter’s rhetoric but has come to respect his work “energizing” antitrust law focused on monopolies.\n\n“These cases are extraordinarily important,” he said. “These are old legal principles, and they are showing how they are applicable today.”\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, whether the more aggressive approach to antitrust endures beyond the Biden years is an open question. The Kanter-Khan era may come to be seen as a watershed, or it could turn out to be a brief eddy in the broader current of capitalism.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal its loss. And much like Microsoft, which now has a market value north of $3 trillion, the tech giant could emerge with its strength intact or even increased.\n\nPolitical Pressure\n\nDebates about how big and powerful companies should be often don’t break along partisan lines. And actions taken by one administration can reverberate beyond the election cycle, even when political winds shift.\n\nThe Trump administration first sued Google over search and also opened the investigation that led to the Apple lawsuit, filed in March. Republicans such as Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, have at times lauded the work of Biden’s antitrust enforcers. Still, Trump, the standard bearer for the traditional party of business, is seen as friendlier toward mergers.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who rose to political prominence in the tech-centric San Francisco Bay Area, hasn’t revealed much about her views on antitrust, but some powerful Democratic donors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley have pressed her to change course from Biden’s policies.\n\nOrbach, the law professor, said merger challenges have had a chilling effect and that the next administration may shift gears.\n\n“The harm to business is meaningful,” he said. “The impact on transactions in the markets and flow of capital has been negative.”\n\nKanter said the impact is greatest “on deals that raise competition concerns.”\n\n“To the extent that our work is having a chilling effect on anticompetitive deals, or deals that otherwise shouldn't leave the boardroom in the first place, then that's our work being efficient,” he said.\n\nWith the presidential race in its final weeks, Kanter brought another case that could shake up a vast industry. Earlier this month, the Justice Department sued Visa for monopolizing debit-card markets — an investigation that grew out of a Trump-era case barring the payments giant from buying fintech Plaid Inc.\n\nDuring that fight, antitrust enforcers said they unearthed evidence that Visa had tried to prevent rivals such as Paypal Holdings Inc., Block Inc. and Apple from competing with its networks.

Prosecutors also failed — three times — to convince juries that Tyson Foods Inc. executives had fixed chicken prices. Undeterred, Kanter hired more litigators and continued to bring cases.\n\nTo build public support, Kanter and other antitrust enforcers have tried to communicate plainly, eschewing talk about economic models in favor of references to “green bubble” text messages and song lyrics. Kanter, who has a music studio in his basement, said his familiarity with the technology behind recording helped him understand how giant online platforms work.\n\nKanter has met with farmers in Minnesota, emergency room doctors in Washington, musicians in Nashville and elementary school students from Connecticut to talk about antitrust and hear how business practices affect Americans. He also regularly visits law schools, where he said interest in antitrust is high.\n\n“They’re growing up in a world where they see economic opportunity as closed off and there’s a lack of confidence that they’ll have the same economic opportunities as their parents and grandparents had,” Kanter said.\n\nRick Rule led the Justice Department's antitrust division from 1986 to 1989 and later worked with Kanter in private practice. He said Kanter’s approach is diametrically opposed to his own, but likely represents a lasting change.\n\n“Clearly his goal and his focus has been on reversing what we did in the 1980s,” Rule said.\n\n“Antitrust does have broad sweeps of the pendulum, and I think the pendulum has swung toward more aggressive enforcement,” said Rule, who called Kanter’s victory in the Google case “a hallmark success.”\n\nLong Battles\n\nKanter said the Google decision belongs on the “Mount Rushmore” of seminal monopoly cases, including the rulings that led to the breakups of Standard Oil and AT&T.\n\nThose companies were core gatekeepers that competitors, customers and the economy couldn’t do without, Kanter said.

        "title": "Biden’s Antitrust Cop Got a Big Win. Will It Be His Last?",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hetal Doshi sprinted down the marble hallway on the fourth floor of the Justice Department’s antitrust division last month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\n\n“We won! We won! We won!” she shouted, bursting into a wood-paneled conference room where Jonathan Kanter, the assistant US attorney general for antitrust, sat talking with a team of young lawyers. Doshi, Kanter’s head of litigation, embraced him.\n\nKanter paused. “What did we win?”\n\nMinutes earlier, a federal judge in Washington had ruled that Alphabet Inc.’s Google had illegally monopolized the market for online search and search advertising. The decision marked the US’s most significant victory in a monopoly case since its initial triumph over Microsoft Corp. more than two decades ago.\n\nFor Kanter, a 51-year-old lawyer brought in to the Biden administration with a mandate to restore competition in Corporate America, it was a moment to savor — a crowning achievement for an antitrust revival that has sought to show that laws first enacted to rein in 19th century business titans apply to 21st century technology juggernauts.\n\n“No company, no matter how big or how influential, is above the law,” Kanter said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Antitrust laws apply today just as much as they did the day they were written.”\n\nKanter and Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, have led one of the most confrontational chapters in recent US regulatory history — and become targets for industry leaders who say the Biden administration has been too aggressive in overseeing business. Kanter says that competition is good and necessary for free markets.\n\nIn the three years since Kanter took his post, the Justice Department has accused bellwether US companies of illegally dominating markets for digital advertising (Google), smartphones (Apple Inc.), concert tickets (Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s Ticketmaster) and debit cards (Visa Inc.). It has also blocked numerous mergers, frustrating executives, bankers and investors.\n\nBarak Orbach, a professor at the University of Arizona law school, said he was wary of Kanter’s rhetoric but has come to respect his work “energizing” antitrust law focused on monopolies.\n\n“These cases are extraordinarily important,” he said. “These are old legal principles, and they are showing how they are applicable today.”\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, whether the more aggressive approach to antitrust endures beyond the Biden years is an open question. The Kanter-Khan era may come to be seen as a watershed, or it could turn out to be a brief eddy in the broader current of capitalism.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal its loss. And much like Microsoft, which now has a market value north of $3 trillion, the tech giant could emerge with its strength intact or even increased.\n\nPolitical Pressure\n\nDebates about how big and powerful companies should be often don’t break along partisan lines. And actions taken by one administration can reverberate beyond the election cycle, even when political winds shift.\n\nThe Trump administration first sued Google over search and also opened the investigation that led to the Apple lawsuit, filed in March. Republicans such as Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, have at times lauded the work of Biden’s antitrust enforcers. Still, Trump, the standard bearer for the traditional party of business, is seen as friendlier toward mergers.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who rose to political prominence in the tech-centric San Francisco Bay Area, hasn’t revealed much about her views on antitrust, but some powerful Democratic donors from Wall Street to Silicon Valley have pressed her to change course from Biden’s policies.\n\nOrbach, the law professor, said merger challenges have had a chilling effect and that the next administration may shift gears.\n\n“The harm to business is meaningful,” he said. “The impact on transactions in the markets and flow of capital has been negative.”\n\nKanter said the impact is greatest “on deals that raise competition concerns.”\n\n“To the extent that our work is having a chilling effect on anticompetitive deals, or deals that otherwise shouldn't leave the boardroom in the first place, then that's our work being efficient,” he said.\n\nWith the presidential race in its final weeks, Kanter brought another case that could shake up a vast industry. Earlier this month, the Justice Department sued Visa for monopolizing debit-card markets — an investigation that grew out of a Trump-era case barring the payments giant from buying fintech Plaid Inc.\n\nDuring that fight, antitrust enforcers said they unearthed evidence that Visa had tried to prevent rivals such as Paypal Holdings Inc., Block Inc. and Apple from competing with its networks. Visa has said that the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nWhatever happens in November, some observers say Kanter’s approach to fighting alleged monopolies has permanently changed the landscape.\n\n“There’s been a sea change in how both parties view antitrust enforcement,” said Josh Tzuker, who worked in the Justice Department before joining consulting firm FGS Global this year. “There will be plenty of enforcement no matter who is president.”\n\nSpeaking Plainly\n\nKanter’s tenure got off to a turbulent start: The antitrust division lost challenges to three mergers.

        "title": "Epic Games sues Google and Samsung over anti-competition collusion claims",
        "content": "The maker of Fortnite is filing a lawsuit in the US against Google and Samsung, accusing the two firms of “colluding” to make it harder for third-party apps to be downloaded on their platforms.\n\nEpic Games has accused Google of pushing Samsung – which runs Google’s Android operating system on its phones – into making it harder for users to download apps from places which are not Google or Samsung’s own app stores.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Epic alleges that Samsung’s recent switch to make a feature called Auto Blocker – a tool which stops users from installing apps from third party sources – on by default was “intentionally crafted” by Google and Samsung to create more friction for users when they try to download apps from alternate app stores.\n\nThe Fortnite maker argues that Google has been trying to “pre-emptively undermine” a previous ruling made in US court, which found the tech giant had created an “illegal monopoly” in how it operated app distribution on Android, giving its own Google Play Store prominence and limiting access for other, third party app stores.\n\nIn a blog post announcing the lawsuit, Epic Games said: “We are filing a court case against Google and Samsung over coordinated efforts to block competition in app distribution on Samsung devices with Samsung’s default-on Auto Blocker feature.\n\n“Auto Blocker is the latest in a long series of dealings in which Google and Samsung have agreed not to compete to protect Google’s monopoly power.\n\n“Auto Blocker cements the Google Play Store as the only viable way to get apps on Samsung devices, blocking every other store from competing on a level playing field.\n\n“Our litigation alleges that Samsung’s recent implementation of the Auto Blocker feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to pre-emptively undermine the U.S. District Court’s remedy following the jury’s verdict in Epic’s case against Google.\n\n“The jury found that Google’s app store practices are illegal, including the unlawful agreements Google enters into with phone manufacturers such as Samsung.\n\n“Allowing this co-ordinated illegal anti-competitive dealing to proceed hurts developers and consumers and undermines both the jury’s verdict and regulatory and legislative progress around the world.”\n\nThe game developer has been fighting big tech firms for years over anti-competitive behaviour on their app stores, and only recently returned to both Android and Apple’s iOS platform in Europe after new EU rules forced the firm’s to loosen their controls on third-party app stores, allowing Epic to launch its own the Epic Games Store on their platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking to reporters about the lawsuit, Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the company was concerned that Google was looking to get around any potential restrictions placed upon it to open up its platform, by encouraging phone makers and others that rely on the Android operating system but not subject to the same rulings, to implement the alleged anti-competitive processes instead.\n\n“The timing of this is really disconcerting,” he said.\n\n“Epic went through major antitrust litigation at a jury trial at the end of last year – we won. the jury trial on all counts.\n\n“A fear we’ve had all along is that Google would take many of the illegal practices that they’re doing and convince carriers and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to do them instead.\n\n“So that when the court finally issues remedies and an injunction against Google practices, we are very concerned that Google would simply attempt to hand off all of those bad practices to partners who are not under that injunction and to continue to block competing (app) stores and to make Android an incredibly difficult platform to compete on.”\n\nMr Sweeney said since Samsung had made the switch to make the Auto Blocker feature on by default, it had created a 21 step process that users now needed to go through to download the Epic Games Store and access Fortnite.\n\nHe also accused the two companies of “misleading” users through their labelling of the Epic Games Store download file as “unknown” when users attempt to install it, arguing that the games developer has had a long-standing relationship with both companies and is not an unknown or unverified source.",

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Uber",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 30, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Uber Technologies UBER.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCan AI, AD and Waymo Drive GOOGL's Stock Higher?\n\nAlphabet has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), search engines and autonomous driving technology, which, in turn, is instilling investor optimism in its stock. With a 16.5% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry’s return of 14.3%.\n\nHowever, the GOOGL stock has lagged behind the broader technology sector’s rally of 23.4% and the S&P 500 index’s gain of 20% in the same time frame.\n\nAlphabet has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in generative AI (GenAI) technology. Its growing GenAI capabilities are driving its momentum in the booming cloud computing market and the search engine space by enhancing search results.\n\nThe company is also riding on its strength in YouTube and its dominant position in the search engine market, which are playing a vital role in shaping the growth trajectory of its advertisement business.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding footprint in the self-driving vehicle space on the back of Waymo is another major positive.\n\nHowever, increasing investment expenses, litigation issues associated with data privacy and its AI technology, and market uncertainties are concerning for GOOGL.\n\nAlso, Alphabet faces significant competition in the booming GenAI market from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which are leaving no stone unturned to boost their GenAI-powered offerings.\n\nAlthough Alphabet enjoys a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space, it faces rising competition from the likes of Amazon, Baidu, General Motors and Tesla.\n\nStiff competition poses a risk to GOOGL’s market position.\n\nGiven the combination of both risks and rewards, investors should consider the fact that how these AI, search and autonomous driving initiatives poise Alphabet well for growth opportunities in the long run.\n\nGOOGL Stock Overvalued\n\nGOOGL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nAlphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.32X compared with the industry’s 5.34X, which suggests that investors should wait for a better entry point.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid GenAI Momentum: A Key Catalyst for GOOGL\n\nAlphabet’s division Google is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLM) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\n\nGemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices. Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.\n\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\n\nSolid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\n\nGoogle’s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another positive.\n\nGoogle offers Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, to researchers and developers across the globe. It is available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\n\nIts unveiling of LearnLM, a family of GenAI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Strength Drives GOOGL’s Growth\n\nGoogle’s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are driving traffic on its search platform.\n\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\n\nThe introduction of Search Generative Experience (“SGE”), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is noteworthy.\n\nThe company’s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\n\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet’s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are major positives.\n\nSGE is aiding the performance of GOOGL’s advertisement business by helping in the creation of relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company’s momentum among advertisers. The improving performance of YouTube ads is another positive.\n\nThis apart, the strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is a tailwind. Google’s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are positive.\n\nWaymo Expansion Efforts Boost Prospects\n\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\n\nWaymo’s strong operations in Phoenix, AZ, are a major positive.\n\nThe company’s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter’s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is noteworthy. This deal is in sync with the company’s deepening focus in Phoenix.\n\nThe company also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\n\nApart from Phoenix, Alphabet made Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco. This move marks Waymo’s very first such expansion outside of Phoenix.\n\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles. It is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\n\nAdditionally, the company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year.\n\nWaymo recently expanded its partnership with Uber to introduce the Waymo One experience in Austin and Atlanta via the Uber app. The service will begin in the early 2025.\n\nRising Estimates Reflect Upside Potential in GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet’s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company’s strength in search and YouTube, which are driving its advertisement revenues, is a positive. Also, its growing momentum in Waymo is a plus. All these factors are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $292.3 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14%.\n\nThe same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 60 days.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this data-driven world, wherein AI has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet’s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Moreover, the company’s dominant position in the search engine market and first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space are major positives.\n\nHowever, growing litigation issues related to privacy concerns and AI technology, along with intensifying competition in both AI and autonomous driving fields, do not bode well for the stock.\n\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "title": "Careful not to stifle innovation, Newsom hesitates on major tech bills",
        "content": "Backstage at one of the largest artificial intelligence conferences in the world, Gov. Gavin Newsom listened to two leaders in the field debate opposite views of a high-profile bill on his desk to protect Californians from the technology.\n\n“Honestly, I take advantage of opportunities like this,” Newsom said recounting the exchange later during an interview at the Salesforce conference in San Francisco in mid-September. “I just watched them, and I was like, ‘Here we go. Should I sign it, or should I not?’ Then ‘absolutely,’ ‘absolutely not’ and back and forth.\"\n\nThe scene offered a peek into Newsom's deliberations on regulating the tech industry, including an explosion of AI companies, and the forces seeking to influence him during bill-signing season at the state Capitol. The Democratic governor vetoed the AI bill a week after the conference, adding to criticism that he sides too often with Meta, Google and other power players in an industry he's admired and been friendly with throughout his career.\n\nAs a supervisor and then mayor of San Francisco, Newsom had a front-row seat to the tech boom of the 1990s and forged political and personal ties to the titans of a California industry that funnels billions into the state economy. The guest list to his 2008 wedding in Montana included Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and other A-list business types.\n\nHe's also an entrepreneur at heart whose own irritation over a city regulation, which required him to install a mop sink in his carpeted wine shop, partially motivated his interest in government.\n\nNow as governor, Newsom said he seeks to balance his desire to preserve California’s role as the vanguard of technology against his job to shield society from potential harm, particularly around artificial intelligence.\n\n“The approach is that he wants to be at the forefront, that he thinks somehow regulations, even smart regulations, thwart that effort to go fast,” said Lorena Gonzalez, the leader of the California Labor Federation. “His favorite word is 'innovation.'\"\n\nGonzalez represents labor unions in California that are concerned artificial intelligence will replace jobs. There's also a distrust of Silicon Valley giants that profit off content produced by other people.\n\nNewsom described his own philosophy on governing tech to a room full of conference attendees during a talk with Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff, the godfather of his oldest child.\n\nRead more:Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoes AI safety bill opposed by Silicon Valley\n\n“I want to maintain our dominance. I want to maintain our innovation,” Newsom said at Salesforce's conference, Dreamforce. “At the same time, you feel a deep sense of responsibility to address some of those more extreme concerns that I think many of us have — even the biggest and strongest promoters of this technology have — and that's a difficult place to land.”\n\nThe public also appears torn. Last year, the Pew Research Center said 52% of Americans were more concerned than excited about AI in their daily lives.\n\nSiding with Big Tech\n\nPrompted by slow movement from the federal government, California legislators heeded a call this year to do more to regulate AI.\n\nBut there's a divide about the best way to move forward.\n\nUnder SB 1047, Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) sought to put among the first sweeping restrictions on the industry to prevent the technology from being misused to conduct cyberattacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nProponents, who include Elon Musk and the Center for AI Safety, say that the bill was necessary to prevent catastrophic disasters. Pioneers of artificial intelligence have warned about the danger of AI surpassing human intelligence and losing control over the technology if government fails to act.\n\nThe proposal was opposed by some of the largest tech companies in the world, including Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other products. Facebook and Google collectively spent nearly $800,000 to lobby the Legislature, governor’s office and state agencies on SB 1047 and dozens of other policies from January through the end of June.\n\nChatGPT maker OpenAI and Democratic congressional leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), expressed concerns that the bill could stifle innovation in California.\n\nDays before he vetoed the bill, Newsom said the legislation “created its own weather system” of interest in California and beyond.\n\n“It’s one of those bills that come across your desk infrequently, where it depends on who the last person on the call was in terms of how persuasive they are,” Newsom said. “It’s divided so many folks.”\n\nNewsom in his veto message said the legislation, while well-intentioned, could give the public false sense of security about the new, rapidly developing technology.\n\n“SB 1047 does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data,\" Newsom's veto message stated. \"Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.”\n\nRead more:Mark Hamill, Jane Fonda, J.J. Abrams urge Gov. Newsom to sign AI safety bill\n\nPerhaps anticipating criticism of the veto, Newsom on Sunday also announced that his administration has enlisted leaders in the field to help the state create workable protections for the deployment of AI, focusing on analyzing its capabilities and risks. Newsom vowed to work with state lawmakers on the issue in the next legislative session.\n\nTeri Olle, director of Economic Security California Action, which co-sponsored SB 1047, said Newsom's veto forfeits a promising opportunity to put responsible guardrails around AI development.\n\n“The failure of this bill demonstrates the enduring power and influence of the deep pocketed tech industry, driven by the need to maintain the status quo — a hands-off regulatory environment and exponential profit margins,\" Olle said in a statement. \"The vast majority of Californians, and American voters, want their leaders to prioritize AI safety and don’t trust companies to prioritize safety on their own.”\n\nMany leaders and members of actors guild SAG-AFTRA, including President Fran Drescher, signed a letter urging Newsom to sign SB 1047. On Sunday, SAG-AFTRA said the union will continue to work toward a safer and more ethical AI world.\n\n\"While the promise of AI is yet to come, the dangers of AI are already being experienced,\" a union spokesperson said in a statement. \"To avoid inevitable catastrophes that come with unchecked tech, the time to ensure AI safety through regulation, including accountability and transparency, is urgent.\"\n\nNewsom and Democrats in the Legislature also came under fire this year when they shelved a bill that would have required Google and Meta to pay news outlets for distributing their content.\n\nInstead, lawmakers struck a controversial compromise between Google and newspaper publishers that is expected to result in the company and the state spending $250 million over five years to fund programs to research artificial intelligence and support local journalism. The funding is a fraction of the money the companies could have been on the hook for under the bill.\n\nThe deal split the newspaper industry. Publishers supported the agreement, while labor unions representing journalists opposed the plan and were not involved in the negotiations. Newsom was a party in the deal and agreed to provide taxpayer dollars to support the journalism initiatives.\n\nThe agreement, and the omission of unions at the negotiating table, prompted Gonzalez to publicly state that Newsom is \"enamored\" with tech.\n\n“It would be helpful to have somebody with as much power as he has to really explore how supporting working people in technology changes, and empowering them, can also coexist with tech changing,\" she said of Newsom.\n\nGonzalez and the powerful Teamsters union have been at odds with the governor over legislation to regulate autonomous trucks.\n\nNewsom vetoed a Teamsters-backed bill last year that would have required a human operator in any vehicle over 10,000 pounds. The union tried a repeat of the bill this year, and the legislation met a similar fate. In his veto message released Saturday, Newsom said he offered several amendments to the bill that were not accepted.\n\nRead more:California lawmakers are trying to regulate AI before it's too late. Here's how\n\nThe governor said California must balance the state's strong worker protection laws with its status as a leader in technological innovation: \"We reject that one aim must yield to the other, and our success disproves this false binary.\"\n\nThe Teamsters released a statement after the veto was announced saying the \"vast majority of Californians oppose unregulated, unaccountable driverless cars and trucks on our roads.\"\n\n\"A regulatory framework that ignores this reality does not benefit the people of California — the millions who want good middle-class jobs and safe streets, the people that our state government is bound by duty to serve. Such a framework only benefits a handful of billionaires in the tech industry,\" the union said.\n\nThe state released draft regulations last month that could allow for testing of driverless trucks on state highways.\n\nTechnology companies and their billionaire chief executives have been some of the most generous donors to Newsom's campaigns.\n\nMore than a half dozen tech executives and investors gave more than $100,000 each to his campaign against the recall, including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt; Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings; DoorDash co-founders Andy Fang and Stanley Tang; former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer; former Twilio Chief Executive Jeffrey Lawson; and Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway, among others.\n\nA long-standing interest\n\nIn an interview in August, the governor cited his 2013 book, \"Citizenville: How to Take the Town Square Digital and Reinvent Government,\" as an example of his approach to technology.\n\nThe governor begins the book by retelling a story about a visit from the president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, when Newsom was mayor. Newsom writes that he was eager to tell the president about the city's exciting new tech initiatives, such as paying parking meters with cellphones.\n\nThe president was unmoved. Estonia had been doing that for years, as well as paying for parking tickets, property taxes and other government fees. They had free Wi-Fi, too.\n\nNewsom describes the moment as a \"wake-up call\" to the reality that San Francisco wasn't on the forefront of technology, but actually lagging behind. He goes on to call government's delay in implementing new technologies \"a big problem\" in the book.\n\nUnder Newsom, the state has developed guidelines for public agencies to assess and safely use AI, hosted a summit on the topic with Stanford University and UC Berkeley and announced agreements to implement new technologies within government.\n\nDee Dee Myers, director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development, described the governor as \"congenially imaginative.\"\n\n\"He grew up in a community where there was a lot of technology and a lot of energy around it, and a lot of belief that you could make these things work,\" Myers said. \"You could take and create something where it didn't exist before. He believes that we can harness some of this energy and these ideas to solve problems and to improve the quality of life for people, whether it's just better regulation for his mop sink or AI that could help us manage our resources better.\"\n\nTussles with the industry\n\nTodd O’Boyle, senior director of technology policy at tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said he doesn't see Newsom as \"too close to the tech community.\"\n\n“There have been plenty of issues where tech wishes he might have gone a different direction. I think the reality is that tech is a major industry in the state of California,\" O'Boyle said. \"The governor is very mindful that a number of his constituents do work in tech, and that a healthy tech sector is great for the California economy and the California budget and critical to paying for California’s social safety net.\"\n\nThe governor's aides also reject the suggestion that he's too slow to regulate.\n\n\"He thinks we have to have smart regulations and we have to have a thoughtful process of regulation that balances different interests,\" Myers said. \"So, I don't think anybody else in the country would say that California has failed to regulate. That's not our brand.\"\n\nNewsom's office pointed to legislation he endorsed to protect children from social media.\n\nThe governor signed a bill this year to limit the ability of companies to provide “addictive feeds” on applications to minors and to restrict notifications to children's phones during the school day and at night.\n\nSenate Bill 976 was opposed by the Chamber of Progress, which counts Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, TikTok owner ByteDance, Amazon, Google and Apple as its members. NetChoice, a national tech trade association, also opposed the bill.\n\nHe's had other tussles with the industry.\n\nCiting violations of the 1st Amendment, NetChoice sued to block a bill Newsom signed in 2022 that sought to require businesses that offer online services to provide privacy protections for children. The governor, who has four children, was angry over the lawsuit and expressed his frustration with tech executives directly for trying to prevent the bill from taking effect.\n\nNewsom's relationship with Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, founder of SpaceX and executive chairman of X, has also soured as the tech leader shifted to the right and threatened to move his companies to other states in response to California's policies.\n\nWhen Musk tweeted a doctored video that altered Vice President Kamala Harris' voice, giving the false impression that she called herself a \"diversity hire,\" Newsom pledged to make it illegal to manipulate a voice in an ad.\n\nOn stage with Benioff at Dreamforce, Newsom signed into law several bills that seek to stamp out altered content.\n\n\"It was just wrong on every level — malicious intent behind these deepfakes impacting elections,\" the governor said before pulling out his pen.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - “Fortnite” video game maker Epic Games on Monday accused Alphabet’s Google and Samsung, the world’s largest Android phone manufacturer, of conspiring to protect Google’s Play store from competition.\n\nEpic said it would file a lawsuit in U.S. federal court in California alleging that a Samsung smartphone security feature called Auto Blocker was in truth intended to deter users from downloading Android apps from sources other than the Play store or Samsung's Galaxy store, which the Korean company elected to put on the back burner.\n\nSamsung and Google are violating U.S. antitrust law by reducing consumer choice and preventing competition that would make apps less expensive, Epic said.\n\nThe game company said Samsung's Auto Blocker was designed to blunt the impact of a U.S. verdict that Epic won against Google in December 2023 that is expected to force the company to make apps easier to obtain from other sources.\n\nEpic said it will also raise its competition concerns with regulators in the European Union, which has long scrutinized Google’s business practices.\n\nEpic Chief Executive Tim Sweeney called the lawsuit part of a \"major global fight\" to defend competition and its benefits for consumers.\n\nSamsung introduced Auto Blocker on its smartphones in late 2023 as an opt-in feature to protect users from downloading apps that may contain malware. Epic said Samsung made Auto Blocker the default setting in July and intentionally made it difficult to disable or bypass.\n\nCary, North Carolina-based Epic Games sued Google in 2020, claiming it stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments.\n\nIn that case, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco is weighing what changes the company must make to its app business after the jury's December finding that it held an illegal monopoly.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by David Bario and Cynthia Osterman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\n\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports reveal that social platform Snapchat has expanded an existing partnership with Google Cloud to include generative AI features offered by the latter into the My AI chatbot offered by the former. Snap has used ChatGPT by OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, for the My AI chatbot, but is now transitioning to the Google model. Wedbush analysts, led by Scott Devitt, talked about Google Cloud in a recent investor note, detailing that Google was well positioned to drive adoption of generative AI tools given its AI-optimized compute infrastructure supported by custom silicon, and unmatched breadth of data to develop and train AI models across text, images, and video.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Newsom vetoes US's first bill aimed at regulating large-scale artificial intelligence",
        "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a first-of-its-kind state bill that would potentially enact the most impactful artificial intelligence regulation in the country.\n\nThe measure, known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, would require safety measures from companies that spend more than $100 million to train AI models. It aims to prevent potential harms by AI such as mass casualty events, and includes implementing a \"kill switch\" to completely shut down a rogue model.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of AI's biggest players including: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (GOOG), and Meta (META). However, in his veto message on Sunday afternoon Newsom said SB 1047 is \"well-intentioned,\" but it \"does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.”\n\nAlong with the veto, Newsom announced he's working with leading experts — including \"the godmother of AI\" Fei-Fei Li — to set guardrails around the deployment of GenAI. He also ordered state agencies to expand their assessment of the risks associated with the technology.\n\nRegulating the technology has been a flashpoint in Silicon Valley and beyond. OpenAI, Google and Meta publicly opposed the bill. Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN), cautiously supported it after suggesting amendments to its original version.\n\nDespite the pushback from big tech, more than 100 current and former employees from Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic called on Newsom to sign the legislation earlier this month, expressing concerns that “the most powerful AI models may soon pose severe risks.”\n\nMore than 125 Hollywood actors, directors and entertainment leaders had also urged Newsom to sign the bill, writing in a letter: \"we fully believe in the dazzling potential of AI to be used for good. But we must also be realistic about the risks.\"\n\nSB 1047 had to thread the needle between encouraging innovation in the rapidly changing industry while ensuring the tech is used responsibly.\n\nNewsom discussed his concerns over SB 1047 with Salesforce (CRM) CEO, Marc Benioff, at the annual Dreamforce conference earlier this month. “The impact of signing wrong bills over the course of a few years could have a profound impact,\" Newsom said referring to the state's competitiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is a space where we dominate and I want to maintain our dominance. I want to maintain our innovation. I want to maintain our ecosystem. I want to continue to lead. At the same time, you feel a deep sense of responsibility to address some of those more extreme concerns that I think many of us have, even the biggest and strongest promoters of this technology have.\"\n\nSupporters of the legislation include billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, who owns large AI model company xAI, along with the so-called \"Godfathers of AI\": Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton. California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nThe main author of the bill, California state Senator Scott Wiener, has said it's a reasonable framework for an under-regulated technology. Wiener has been vocal about the need for a strong federal law that would set nationwide guardrails for all developers.\n\nHowever, Wiener isn't hopeful that a national AI safety bill will be a reality anytime soon, calling congress \"completely paralyzed when it comes to technology policy\" at a press conference last month.\n\n\"Let me be clear - I agree with the author - we cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public,\" Newsom wrote, adding \"I do not agree, however, that to keep the public safe, we must settle for a solution that is not informed by an empirical trajectory analysis of Al systems and capabilities. Ultimately, any framework for effectively regulating Al needs to keep pace with the technology itself.\"\n\nThe bill was set to reshape the future of AI and numerous tech executives have spoken out.\n\n\"There are risks associated with AI, less to do with the models themselves and more to do with what the models are allowed to do in the real world if left completely unsupervised,\" Affirm (AFRM) CEO, Max Levchin, told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference.\n\n\"So I'm not diminishing or dismissing the need for controls, and model governance and oversight and thoughtful rule making. I would just not want to 'shut it all down' to quote another AI doomerist.\"\n\nAlthough the bill flew past the state assembly 48-16 (7 democrats voted no) and Senate 30-9 (one democrat voted no) in August, it's faced some political opposition from California Democrats.\n\nCritics of SB 1047 include eight California house members — Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna G. Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan, Lou Correa — and longtime Newsom ally former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIn the last month, Newsom has signed 17 AI-related bills aimed at combating deepfake election content, protecting actors and entertainers over their digital likeness, regulating sexually explicit content created by AI among other measures.\n\nThe new set of laws will require developers and social media companies to prevent irresponsible use of its platform using deceptive content.\n\nWhile those legislation address the immediate dangers of AI, SB 1047 looks ahead at some of the most extreme risks posed by advanced models.\n\nWhile speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Joe Biden called on world leaders to establish AI standards that protect human life.\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we need to do to manage this new technology,\" President Biden said. \"In the years ahead, there may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with AI.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI feel like I have gotten dumber each day of September.\n\nAnd honestly, I have no one to blame but the person looking back in the mirror.\n\nI have mostly spent the month on the West Coast ingesting the latest advances in artificial intelligence. First at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference, then Salesforce's (CRM) annual Dreamforce extravaganza, and currently with AI chats on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (now stationed at the Nasdaq). I'll toss in a Netflix event I went to Thursday night where Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates talked for an hour, mostly on AI and the future of the world.\n\nTechnically, I guess all of these AI discussions are making me a more informed journalist, leader, and human being.\n\nBut sometimes listening to what people deep in the weeds are doing in AI sound like a completely different language. Think Martians speaking on Pluto. And the lingo and development of AI tools and products are moving at a speed multiples faster compared to my last West Coast venture in September 2023.\n\nHard to keep up and not think you have an IQ of 75!\n\nIt already feels like I am way behind the curve on understanding the next wave of AI — and that's alarming because 1) there's potential for at least five more waves to hit civilization; 2) the average person on the street unlikely realizes how their very way of life is about to be affected by an AI-powered agent or some other piece of technology. Bill Gates dives into the future of the world at a Netflix event on Thursday alongside journalist Kara Swisher. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWe saw that firsthand with the new AI functionality Meta (META) and OpenAI showed off this week for their various products. This was a series of wow moments.\n\nBill Gates proceeded to tell a packed theater that AI will soon become \"superior\" at \"very profound\" tasks. Reassuring!\n\nI also experienced it up close and personal with a real nice German fella named Richard Socher on Opening Bid (video above).\n\nNever heard of the 41-year-old Socher? You should be following his work at search engine You.com, a company he founded. He was the first chief scientist at Salesforce (CEO Marc Benioff was an early backer of You.gov), and he eats, sleeps, and breathes AI.\n\nThe company is now valued at close to $1 billion after an investment led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHere are a couple of quotes from Socher that left an impression:\n\n\"I think over the next few years and maybe decades, almost every company will be hit with some kind of innovator's dilemma in that the way they used to make revenue is going to change because a lot of their processes are going to get automated with AI. And that just changes the nature of the work that you're doing. You need to stop thinking about almost any repetitive process. Every time you feel like, oh, I've done this before, I'm just going through these steps, you should be giving those as a prompt to an agent and then get an accurate AI agent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think actually in the next few years, we're probably going to see more and more AI agents surfing the web for you than we have people surfing the web, which will change the web as we know it too, and how it often monetizes. But it basically means that a lot of people will get access to their own personal assistant in the way only really wealthy people have right now.\"\n\nYou may be wondering what this all means to you, the investor.\n\nHere are a few notes from me on that front before you go:\n\n2025 is going to be one hell of a year for Nvidia and AMD (AMD). The demand for AI chips only seems to be strengthening. What that means for struggling Intel (INTC), well... This coming earnings season, listen for executives at companies you invest in outline cost-cutting moves by using AI. If you hear crickets, it could be a signal the company doesn't have a great AI strategy in place and risks getting left behind. Today is the day to buy three books on AI to understand the lingo and possibilities — and then think critically on how the technology could be applied to investments you are eying.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid. Find more episodes on our video hub. Watch on your preferred streaming service. Or listen and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIn the below Opening Bid episode, early You.com backer and Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff shares his views on how AI will shape the business world.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "The cold war between Google and Microsoft has 'gone hot'",
        "content": "A long-standing feud between Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) is spilling into public view once again.\n\nThe latest shot from Google came in a complaint filed with the European Commission Wednesday, accusing Microsoft of violating the European Union’s antitrust law.\n\nGoogle said in a document provided to Yahoo Finance that Microsoft illegally leveraged its dominant enterprise server software “Windows Server” licenses to force customers to stick with Microsoft for cloud computing.\n\nMicrosoft predicted Google would \"fail\" in this instance, saying it had already settled similar concerns raised by European cloud providers.\n\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nThe new dispute demonstrates \"this is a cold war that's gone hot,\" Adam Kovacevich, CEO and Founder of the tech policy advocacy group Chamber of Progress, told Yahoo Finance. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October after testifying in the largest antitrust case since the 1990s. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\n'Scroogled'\n\nThe two tech giants have spent the last two decades battling for supremacy in technologies ranging from online search and cloud computing to the markets for operating systems, gaming software, online advertising — and now artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nThe feud began in the first decade after Microsoft settled a landmark antitrust case brought by the US Justice Department alleging it boxed out rivals by making its browser free and the default on its dominant Windows operating system.\n\nA 2002 settlement opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market and created an opportunity for Google, then a startup formed by Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.\n\nMicrosoft defended its reestablished territory in a series of videos first released in 2011, in which Microsoft skewered Google with parodies suggesting that Google’s competing Gmail service, Chrome browser, and accompanying software lacked quality and privacy.\n\nA video titled “Gmail Man” questioned Google's ethics by accusing it of mining every word within its Gmail customers' private emails in order to target them with advertisements.\n\nIn other videos titled \"Scroogled\" and \"Googlighting\" — a spoof on the 1980s hit television series \"Moonlighting\" — Microsoft questioned whether consumers should trust Google with handling their private information.\n\nIn 2016, the companies entered into a ceasefire with an agreement to end regulatory complaints against each other globally as two new CEOs — Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella — took over.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe pact came to an end in 2021 as regulators in the US and EU stepped up pressure on both companies, and Microsoft complained that Google used unfair tactics to compete in online search and advertising.\n\n'You brush your teeth, and you search on Google'\n\nThings really got uncomfortable last year during a high-profile antitrust trial that pitted Google against the US Justice Department — a case that alleged Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and had echoes of the case the DOJ filed against Microsoft in the 1990s.\n\nThe most prominent witness to testify against Google was Nadella, who did not hesitate to take a shot at his rival while on the stand. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (R) arrives at federal court last October to testify in Google's antitrust trial. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google,” Nadella said, emphasizing Google’s overwhelming dominance in the search engine market.\n\nNadella said Microsoft’s own search engine, Bing, failed to gain traction because Google had negotiated for Google Search to get default placement on browsers, desktops, and mobile devices like Apple's iPhones and iPads and Android-based smartphones made by Samsung and others.\n\nNadella went on to describe the imbalance as a “vicious cycle” that he worried would intensify with the development of AI.\n\nGoogle lost the case in a judge’s ruling that labeled its search business an illegal monopoly. The resolution is now pending a remedies phase that could result in a breakup of Google’s empire.\n\nMicrosoft certainly had a lot to gain from a Google defeat, Kovacevich said.\n\n“They were probably the main instigator of the US Justice Department's antitrust suit over Google,” Kovacevich said. “And the guilty verdict against Google probably stands to benefit Microsoft's Bing most of anyone.”\n\nMicrosoft is taking a similar approach in yet another antitrust lawsuit against Google that is still in its initial trial phase. It argues there that Google’s control of online advertising technologies has harmed the success of its Bing browser.\n\nNew feud before the EU\n\nIt's unknown if the EU will take up Google's most recent attack against Microsoft's cloud computing rules.\n\nGoogle is arguing that Microsoft imposed a 400% markup on customers to migrate their Windows Server licenses to a competing cloud service, while customers who chose Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, could migrate for “essentially nothing.”\n\nIn making its case, Google is using the same sort of \"bundling\" or \"tying\" claims used in the 1998 case against Microsoft brought by the DOJ.\n\nBack then, US prosecutors alleged that Microsoft illegally monopolized the market for personal computing operating systems by using its Windows operating system to give away its browser, Internet Explorer, for free.\n\nThe move bundled the browser along with Windows, eventually putting rival browser Netscape Navigator out of business. Then-Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in 2002 with his then-wife Melinda at the US District Courthouse in Washington, DC. AFP PHOTO /Stephen JAFFE (Photo credit should read STEPHEN JAFFE/AFP via Getty Images) (STEPHEN JAFFE via Getty Images)\n\nMicrosoft was eventually required to open up Windows to third party software, which paved the way for companies including Google to \"interoperate\" or run their browser and search software using Microsoft-powered computers.\n\nNow, in the market for cloud computing, Google is arguing that Microsoft leveraged \"dominance in one market to prevent competition on the merits in a separate, unrelated market,\" according to the document shared with Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analysts Becoming More Confident About Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Gen AI Offerings",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nChris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is “ a lot of momentum” behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.\n\n“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”\n\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.\n\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\n“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.\n\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Trending AI Stock to Watch for the Rest of 2024?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares are trending after the company released new AI capabilities. Google Cloud showcased its AI capabilities at the Google Gemini at Work event on Tuesday, highlighting various applications of AI agents in businesses. Analysts from Wedbush, led by Scott Devitt, noted a growing confidence in Google’s generative AI offerings and their potential to drive growth for Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is collaborating with major players like Snap, Volkswagen, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Best Buy to develop AI agents tailored for different tasks. The main types of AI agents include those for customer support, employee assistance, coding, data management, security, and creative projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) also shared that over 2 million developers are utilizing its GenAI solutions, with a remarkable 36-fold increase in Gemini API usage on Vertex AI since the start of the year.\n\nThe key question everyone is asking is whether Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to maintain its search dominance amid the onslaught of AI search products.\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine’s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google’s market share.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Is Still a Long-Term Winner, No Matter the Noise",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) prodigy Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s third-highest-valued stock, experienced a material decline in market capitalization following its Q2 earnings in late August. However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold.  My thesis remains unchanged — I’m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential.\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term AI-Driven Growth Trajectory Remains Intact\n\nIt is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia’s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses.\n\nThere’s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That’s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver.\n\nNVDA Remains a One-Stop AI Powerhouse with Margin Growth\n\nAnother reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang‘s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand.\n\nThis strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA’s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.\n\nFor context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today’s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.\n\nDemand for NVDA’s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.\n\nA Discussion of Nvidia’s Impressive Quarterly Earnings\n\nNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.\n\nThe company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts’ projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company’s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA’s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.\n\nNvidia’s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with revenues expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.\n\nNVDA’s Insider Selling Concerns are Over\n\nInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it’s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.\n\nNotably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.\n\nNVDA Valuation Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Growth Prowess\n\nInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock’s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company’s and slowing growth.\n\nOn the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA’s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA’s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.\n\nGiven NVDA’s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia’s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nWith 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44 implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.\n\nIn the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.\n\nRead full Disclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Is Still a Good Investment Prospect",
        "content": "Nvidia has been an AI juggernaut for the past couple of years as it challenges for the title of the world’s most valuable corporation. Nvidia’s 156% year-to-date gain and 2,700% gain over the past five years may lead many to suspect there’s limited upside from here, but artificial intelligence is still in its early innings. Understanding the AI opportunity and Nvidia’s unique position in the industry leads me to be bullish on the stock.\n\nDiving into the AI Boom\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence has already captivated investors for multiple years, the boom is still going strong, and that leads to my optimism for NVDA stock. Corporations are making significant investments in artificial intelligence, and that demand has resulted in a projected 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034.\n\nArtificial intelligence helps businesses enhance their products and services. For example, CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been investing in Charlotte AI and other AI features to fortify its cybersecurity software. Adobe (ADBE) has also invested in artificial intelligence to help individuals and businesses create better images and videos.\n\nNvidia supplies the AI chips that power these tools. While other semiconductor firms also offer AI chips, Nvidia continues to innovate its chip offerings to stay ahead of the competition. The company is working on its new Blackwell chip, which is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nThe High Cost of AI Infrastructure\n\nRight now, artificial intelligence looks similar to the early days of the internet, in my view. The groundbreaking technology has substantial barriers to entry. Nvidia wins much of the new business, contributing to my bullish outlook for NVDA stock.\n\nBig tech companies within the Magnificent Seven have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology. Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison recently said that the company is behind on its AI infrastructure goals. Oracle will likely turn to Nvidia to close that gap, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales potentially heading Nvidia’s way. Elon Musk’s companies are also in the fray. Tesla and xAI are set to spend a combined $20 billion on AI projects in 2024 alone.\n\nCorporations aren’t flinching and seem resolved to making additional investments in 2025 and beyond. AI infrastructure is expensive to set up, maintain, and scale. This dynamic benefits Nvidia tremendously as it has established a near monopoly in the industry. According to the IDC, organizations are projected to nearly triple their AI investments by the end of 2028. This research suggests a 30% compounded annual growth rate during that stretch.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s Many Partnerships\n\nNvidia is knocking elbows with the ‘who’s who’ of big tech and publicly traded corporations. It’s another reason to feel bullish about the company’s prospects, and Nvidia’s partners have deep wallets. The AI chipmaker has partnerships with Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other titans in the industry.\n\nMany of these same tech companies have been reporting record profits. Nvidia’s biggest customers are relatively well-insulated and can continue to pour money into artificial intelligence even during an economic slowdown. The technology’s mainstream appeal is relatively new, and investments are still ramping up. Nvidia’s partnerships make it more likely that the company will continue outgrowing the broader market regardless of whether the economy stalls.\n\nEven better, key partnerships are likely to expand with age. As Nvidia continues to deliver top-class AI chips to its customers, those clients are more likely to stick with Nvidia and make further large investments. Nvidia has been working with Amazon for more than a decade, while Alphabet recently expanded its partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s Valuation Isn’t Prohibitive\n\nNvidia’s valuation is still reasonably low in considering its revenue and earnings growth rates. While a 58x trailing P/E ratio seems high, especially when compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia has been more than doubling its net income on year-over-year comparisons.\n\nOn a forward basis, Nvidia stock is priced at a 43.5x P/E ratio, making the valuation look more affordable. Furthermore, the company reported 152% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY25. High revenue growth paves the way for high net income growth. If Nvidia continues to report a few more quarters of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, the forward P/E ratio should continue to drop.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia stock is currently rated as a consensus Strong Buy among 42 Wall Street analysts. The average NVDA price target of $152.44 implies about 23% potential upside. The most optimistic price target of $200 reflects 62% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts carry 39 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings on NVDA stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia is an undisputed leader within the artificial intelligence boom. It has established a leading position in supplying the demand for AI capabilities. Nvidia has some of the best customers on the planet, and these corporations are surely to continue investing in AI even during an economic downturn.\n\nRevenue and net income growth remain superb and, when looking at forward multiples, NVDA stock doesn’t look unreasonably valued. Many Wall Street analysts feel the same way, hence the consensus Strong Buy rating. Alongside them, I continue to be bullish NVDA.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "My Favorite \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Nvidia's Not One)",
        "content": "\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks refers to a phrase coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the cohort leading the market. They are:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nTesla lagged behind the others this year due to a decreased demand for electric vehicles, but the other six have done quite well. However, a few of them have reached points where they are no longer attractive buys, leaving only a few that I'd buy right now.\n\nThere are four stocks I'm not interested in right now\n\nIf you don't have a generative artificial intelligence (AI) product, you don't belong in this group. Although Tesla isn't actively engaged in generative AI, its AI research is focused on full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which is another worthy endeavor, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nHowever, Apple was considerably late to the AI party and couldn't even get its Apple Intelligence product ready to go for the iPhone 16 launch. Couple that with the fact that Apple is extremely expensive (30 times forward earnings) with flattening revenue growth, and it quickly falls off the list of good buys.\n\nAs mentioned, the EV market is going through a downward demand wave, so I'm not interested in Tesla.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft are quite pricey, although they may still be good investments in their own right. However, they just don't have the value of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is on the rise\n\nAmazon makes the list of stocks to buy because of its resurging cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although Amazon is expensive in its own right, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 times, it has the potential to drastically decrease that price tag thanks to AWS.\n\nDespite accounting for 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, AWS accounted for 64% of its operating profit. This means that if AWS grows at a faster pace than the rest of Amazon's business, Amazon's profits will rise at a faster pace than revenue growth. Couple that with several profit-boosting initiatives, and Amazon's case to grow profits rapidly takes form.\n\nAs a result, I'm not concerned with Amazon's price tag, and it presents itself as a very attractive buy.\n\nAlphabet is much cheaper than the market\n\nAlphabet's investment case is fairly simple: It's cheap. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system has a healthy but growing ad business, which helps fund its other endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless its AI tools really take off, Alphabet's growth isn't going to be spectacular, but it will likely be consistently in the low double digits, which is enough to provide market-beating growth. Couple that with an improving operating margin and hefty stock buybacks, and you get a stock that can consistently grow earnings in the 20% range (it grew them by over 30% in Q2).\n\nDespite this, Alphabet's stock trades for 18.6 times forward earnings, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23 times forward earnings. Alphabet has the formula to steadily outperform the S&P 500, yet trades at a discount. This is a huge mismatch, and it makes the stock a screaming buy right now.\n\nMeta is rapidly growing profits and revenue\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms sneakily posted the second-highest year-over-year revenue growth of the group over the past year (behind Nvidia's incredible growth).\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta's business is driven by ads on its social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. This allows Meta to fund its AI endeavors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.\n\nBasically, Meta is doing the same thing as Alphabet -- but at a faster pace. GOOGL Normalized Basic EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAs a result, you'll pay a slightly higher premium for Meta's stock at 23.6 times forward earnings. But I think this is a worthy premium to pay, as Meta is currently executing at a high level.\n\nEven though the Magnificent Seven have had a strong 2024, there are still reasons to buy some of the group, and I suspect that their performance will continue to be strong moving forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

They have been,” Karen Dunn, Google’s lead lawyer, said in opening statements. “We are one big company among many others intensely competing on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis for every single ad impression.”\n\nCustomer choice\n\nBoth website publishers and advertisers have many options aside from Google’s ad tech tools, the company said.\n\nIf a publisher doesn’t want to use Google’s tools “there are dozens, if not hundreds of pieces of tech they can use,” said Scott Sheffer, Google’s vice president for global partnerships. And there are “multiple ways to access” ad demand from Google.\n\nIn lieu of using Google’s ad server, which helps websites manage advertising inventory, they can build one in-house, as companies like Amazon.com Inc., Reddit Inc., Snap Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have done, said Mark Israel, Google’s main economic expert. Small websites can use AdSense, which offers publishers ads from Google based on their content, said Sheffer. The company also offers AdX Direct, a product that connects to third-party ad servers like those offered by Microsoft Corp. or Equativ SAS.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder questioning by the Justice Department, Sheffer acknowledged that AdSense or AdX Direct don’t give the same access as if the publisher used Google’s ad server since it is the only one that gets real-time price information.\n\nBut even for publishers using Google’s ad server, there were ways to circumvent the tight connection to the company’s ad exchange, said Nitish Korula, engineering director for ad serving and quality. Websites could instruct the ad server to prioritize a different ad exchange over Google’s, he said. They could also boost bids by entering a higher number into the ad server than the actual bid they received to force Google’s exchange to match it, he said.\n\nAfter questions from the DOJ, Korula acknowledged that few companies use the AdX Direct product. He wrote in 2020 that Google should keep it around because it might help the search giant as a “concept for antitrust.” He also acknowledged that the “boost” feature had “some downsides” since it would interfere with a website’s record-keeping.\n\nQuality control over ads\n\nGoogle, lawyers for the company said, had a legitimate business reason for tightly integrating products across its ad empire: doing so made it easier for its engineers to reduce ad spam and fraud, benefiting the entire advertising ecosystem.\n\nOpening up its tools to third-party rivals too quickly could make it easier for nefarious actors hoping to game the system and profit from advertising scams, the company argued. On the other hand, having more insight into the ads flowing across its systems allowed Google to catch con artists more quickly.\n\nPer Bjorke, a company product director for ad traffic quality, testified on Tuesday that Google was one of two primary companies that detected a multimillion-dollar ad fraud scheme called 3ve, leading to the shutdown of the operation and the prosecution of its leaders in 2018.\n\n“The vast majority of the 3ve traffic we received and bought came from the third-party ecosystem,” Bjorke said. “I believe that is primarily because we made it very hard for bad actors to infiltrate our AdSense and AdX networks.”\n\nAlejandro Borgia, Google’s director of product management for ad safety, testified that Google’s end-to-end ad tech stack made it easier for the company to increase users’ trust in ads. “If users feel unsafe, they won’t click on ads or will turn on ad blockers,” he said.\n\nIn response, the DOJ sought to show that there were other ways to fight spam and fraud besides tying together its ad products. Google, it argued, was not the only company that engaged in that work — and there were times the company wasn’t particularly effective.\n\nMichael Freeman, a DOJ lawyer, asked Bjorke if he had heard of reports that found Google had facilitated the placement of ads on shady websites, including a 2022 ProPublica investigation that covered how Google’s ad business funds disinformation around the world.\n\n“I don’t remember that specific report,” Bjorke said. “I probably read it at the time, but I don’t remember it right now.”\n\nBorgia, Google’s ad safety leader, acknowledged that in July 2021, the tech company only “actively managed” 10% of its safety policies, including only two related to scams. But Borgia said that didn’t mean the company wasn’t enforcing those policies, only that it didn’t have dedicated models or teams focused on them. “We provide safety for those policies through other means,” he said, such as machine learning algorithms.\n\nA wide open digital landscape\n\nThe government alleges that Google dominates the market for display ads shown on websites. But Google says that is just a slice of the digital advertising world today, where brands can connect with consumers on social media, in apps and on streaming video.\n\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said advertisers can and do switch between different advertising formats, and the government should have considered advertising on apps, social media, video, and connected TV, which accounted for $140 billion spent in the US in 2022.\n\n“Facebook, Amazon, TikTok are becoming the strongest players” in digital advertising, he said, adding that Google views them as “serious competitive threats,” where advertisers are shifting their money as needed.\n\nBrian Bumpers, the marketing analytics manager for ecommerce site Zulily, said the company often shifts the $58 million it spends a year on advertising among different places. In 2016, Zulily spent $30 million on Google Ads, but dropped that to about $10 million the next year and increased its spending on Facebook’s platforms to $30 million.\n\n‘No legal obligation’ to help rivals\n\nGoogle argued that US law protects the company’s right to choose whether to make its ad tech products work with others. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make its ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, the company’s lawyer said.\n\nThe government is seeking to force Google to share its customers with competitors, said Dunn, Google’s lead lawyer.\n\nWhen the government says “that rival exchanges need to have comparable access to Google Ads demand,” she said, “that’s our customer base.”\n\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said making Google provide rivals with the same access to its tools would harm competition and amount to “forced interoperability.”\n\nGoogle’s ad exchange AdX was built before real-time bidding was developed, said Korula, the engineering director. “It would take years to rebuild” Google’s exchange to allow that functionality, he said.\n\n“We didn’t prevent other exchanges from submitting real-time bids” into the ad server, Korula said. No company ever offered to undertake the technical work and expense to make their exchanges work with Google’s products, he said.\n\nThe Justice Department argued that Google has already undertaken much of the technological work that needs to happen to make its products operate seamlessly with rivals.\n\nIn 2019, it started a project internally code-named Project Yavin to connect its exchange to the in-house ad servers operated by Microsoft’s LinkedIn and eBay Inc. It has also already let its ad network, Google Ads, bid on certain types of ads in other exchanges and could expand that feature more broadly.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe End of the Cheap Burger Inside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought Apple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters How Harris’ Campaign Finally Made Biden’s Meme Strategy Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 40 richest people in the world who came from poor families. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can directly check out 5 Richest People in the World Who Came From Poor Families.\n\nThe Global Wealth and Inequality\n\nThe richest people who were born poor had to go through troubles of different nature, some had to migrate from their homeland due to wars or economic uncertainties, while others came from poor rural areas. Global wealth inequality has significantly increased over the past few years. According to the 2024 World Inequality Report by Oxfam, almost five billion people globally have become poorer since 2020, while the richest five men in the world have doubled their fortunes during the same period. Global poverty will potentially increase considering the hike in ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. It could take up to 230 years to end poverty, but we could have our first trillionaire in 10 years, as per the Oxfam report.\n\nThe world’s billionaires have increased their wealth by more than $3 trillion in the last three years, while poor people around the world live in dire poverty, without access to clean water, adequate healthcare, decent housing, or education for their kids. In the US, over 60% of workers live paycheck to paycheck despite notable improvements in employee productivity and technology. The real weekly wages for the average US worker are lower today than they were 50 years ago. Poverty is not just an American issue, almost five billion people globally have become poorer since 2020, while the five richest men in the world have become twice as wealthy and are worth more than $1 trillion, as of September 25.\n\nAccording to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report 2024, approximately $83.5 trillion of wealth will be shifted to the next generation within the next 20 to 25 years. Around $9 trillion of this wealth will be transferred horizontally between spouses, the majority in the Americas. Over 10% of the total wealth shift is likely to be made by women to the next generation. The richest people in the world who came from poor families are the most influential entrepreneurs today and many of them live like regular people.\n\nThe millionaire population is increasing and by 2028, the number of adults with wealth of more than $1 million will rise from 52 countries to 56. Taiwan is expected to have the highest millionaire growth by 2028, growing by almost 50%.\n\nBillionaires who come from poor families today have some of the biggest companies in the world. One such billionaire is Sergey Brin, who migrated from Russia to the US at a young age with his parents, suffering from antisemitic discrimination back in the 1970s. Sergey Brin is one of the richest billionaires in the technology industry.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Best Flood Insurance Companies Heading into 2024 and 12 Countries Millionaires Are Moving To.\n\nBrin’s Company is a Trillion-Dollar Company Today\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is one of the few trillion-dollar companies. The market capitalization of Alphabet Inc. is over $2 trillion, as of September 25. Sergey Brin along with Page created Google, a browser that later changed the course of Internet history. In August 1998, Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 check to Larry and Sergey, and Google Inc. was officially born. Today, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has one of the largest Cloud service platforms in the world. The company’s primary revenue source is its Search business, which accounts for 58.6% of its total revenue, as of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring Q2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported improved earnings, exceeding EPS estimates of $1.85 and reporting earnings of $1.89 per share. The company also had a revenue surprise of $445.49 million, reporting a total revenue of $84.74 billion, up by 14% year over year. Alphabet Inc. is rapidly progressing in AI and its generative AI chatbot, Gemini is doing well. The company is also designing its own tensor processors for AI use.\n\nCloud and YouTube are other strong portfolios of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). During Q2 2024, Cloud revenue surged 28.8% to $10.35 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc. is on track to reach a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nAt a forward P/E ratio of 18.62, analysts believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to be one of the best blue chip value stocks in the market. In addition, a strong balance sheet allows the company to continue investing in innovation while navigating economic uncertainties.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We have shortlisted the list of billionaires who have a Forbes Self-made score of 9 and 10. The billionaires with a Self-made score of 9 are the people who came from a largely working-class background or rose from little to nothing. Whereas, the billionaires with a Self-made score of 10 are those who not only grew up poor but also overcame significant obstacles. For the billionaires outside of the US whose self-made score wasn’t mentioned, we shortlisted them based on the same criteria as the self-made scores of 9 and 10. The richest people in the world who came from poor families are ranked in ascending order of their net worth, as of September 25.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

It’s unclear the value of the deal or which company would be the buyer.\n\nThis isn't the first time the two companies have discussed a possible combination.\n\nIn 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) blocked a proposal to merge the two entities, citing antitrust concerns. But it's a much different environment this time around as subscriber losses have accelerated—and more consumers cut the cord in favor of less expensive streaming services.\n\n\"It’s hard to imagine that regulators would block a deal,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote in an email to clients. \"But synergies would likely be much more limited than you might imagine.\" Finally, a partner? A DirecTV satellite dish in Encinitas, California. REUTERS/Mike Blake (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS TELECOMS) (Mike Blake/ REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMoffett referred to the companies' vastly different satellite portfolios, which he argued would not be “remotely worthwhile” to reconfigure in order for them to match.\n\n\"The biggest synergy would once have been to eliminate churn associated with customers moving back and forth between the two companies,\" he said. \"But today they each capture so few gross additions that cutting them, potentially even in half, wouldn’t amount to much.\"\n\nDirecTV and Dish did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the Wall Street Journal report.\n\nShares in EchoStar, which owns Dish Network, jumped about 10% higher on Friday after the merger rumors intensified. The deal, which would also include Dish's streaming brand Sling TV, could help aid EchoStar's heavy debt load, the Journal noted.\n\nMeanwhile, a merger would also help cut costs for the owners of DirecTV. AT&T spun off DirecTV in 2021, moving it into a joint venture with private equity investor TPG. At the time, it was valued at about $16 billion with the telecom giant taking a $15.5 billion impairment charge in 2020 to account for subscriber losses.\n\nDirecTV was dealt yet another blow after it lost its coveted Sunday Ticket package to Alphabet's YouTube TV (GOOGL, GOOG) in late 2022.\n\n\"It’s hard to argue that a merger shouldn’t happen; it clearly should. Consolidation during a period of secular decline is always to be expected,\" Moffett said in his note. \"But it would be a mistake to overestimate its importance. Adding a year or so to the expected life of satellite TV isn’t going to change the narrative for programmers, distributors, or even for satellite TV.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of  AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. At the recent Google Gemini at Work event, the company outlined a range of artificial intelligence agent use cases. Wall Street analysts, like those led by Scott Devitt at Wedbush, took note of this development. In an investor note, the analysts noted that they had come away from the keynote with increased conviction in the strength of Google's enterprise generative AI offerings and their emerging contribution to Google Cloud growth. They added that Google was actively working with enterprise customers to develop AI agents across a variety of use cases. Wedbush has an Outperform rating on Alphabet and a 12-month price target of $205.\n\nSome of the companies working with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in this regard included Snap, Volkswagen, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Best Buy. The investor note highlighted that the six primary uses of AI agents employed by enterprises included customer agents, employee agents, code agents, data agents, security agents and creative agents. Per the note, Google reported more than 2 million developers were building with Google's GenAI solutions, and it had seen 36x growth in Gemini API usage on Vertix AI since the beginning of the year.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Jasper Ward and Kanishka Singh\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who is the Republican presidential candidate, said on Friday he will seek the prosecution of Google if he wins the Nov. 5 election, claiming that the company only displays \"bad stories\" about him.\n\nTrump, in his post on Truth Social, gave no evidence for his assertion about Google.\n\n\"It has been determined that Google has illegally used a system of only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J. Trump, some made up for this purpose while, at the same time, only revealing good stories about\" Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, Trump said.\n\n\"This is an illegal activity, and hopefully the Justice Department will criminally prosecute them for this blatant interference of elections,\" Trump said. \"If not, and subject to the laws of our country, I will request their prosecution, at the maximum levels, when I win the election, and become president of the United States.\"\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump made a similar claim about Google in 2019, according to the Washington Post. He alleged in a series of posts on Twitter, now known as X, that Google favored negative news stories about him in the 2016 presidential election, according to the Post. Google dismissed the claims at the time.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, some supporters of the former president have renewed the allegations. In July, days after an attempted assassination of Trump, billionaire Elon Musk, in a post on X, accused Google of having a search ban on the former president.\n\n(Reporting by Jasper Ward and Kanishka Singh; Editing by Eric Beech)",

        "title": "Can AI, Ad &amp; Waymo Strength Drive GOOGL Stock Beyond 16.5% YTD Gain?",
        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), search engines and autonomous driving technology, which, in turn, is instilling investor optimism in its stock. With a 16.5% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry’s return of 14.3%.\r\n\r\nHowever, the GOOGL stock has lagged behind the broader technology sector’s rally of 23.4% and the S&P 500 index’s gain of 20% in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in generative AI (GenAI) technology. Its growing GenAI capabilities are driving its momentum in the booming cloud computing market and the search engine space by enhancing search results.\r\n\r\nThe company is also riding on its strength in YouTube and its dominant position in the search engine market, which are playing a vital role in shaping the growth trajectory of its advertisement business.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s expanding footprint in the self-driving vehicle space on the back of Waymo is another major positive.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, increasing investment expenses, litigation issues associated with data privacy and its AI technology, and market uncertainties are concerning for GOOGL.\r\n\r\nAlso, Alphabet faces significant competition in the booming GenAI market from the likes of Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, which are leaving no stone unturned to boost their GenAI-powered offerings. \r\n\r\nAlthough Alphabet enjoys a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space, it faces rising competition from the likes of Amazon, Baidu, General Motors and Tesla.\r\n\r\nStiff competition poses a risk to GOOGL’s market position.\r\n\r\nGiven the combination of both risks and rewards, investors should consider the fact that how these AI, search and autonomous driving initiatives poise Alphabet well for growth opportunities in the long run.\n\nGOOGL Stock Overvalued\n\nGOOGL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.32X compared with the industry’s 5.34X, which suggests that investors should wait for a better entry point. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSolid GenAI Momentum: A Key Catalyst for GOOGL\n\nAlphabet’s division Google is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLM) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\r\n\r\nGemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices. Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.\r\n\r\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another positive.\r\n\r\nGoogle offers Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, to researchers and developers across the globe. It is available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\r\n\r\nIts unveiling of LearnLM, a family of GenAI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nSearch, YouTube & Ad Strength Drives GOOGL’s Growth\n\nGoogle’s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are driving traffic on its search platform.\r\n\r\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Search Generative Experience (“SGE”), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company’s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. \r\n\r\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet’s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are major positives.\r\n\r\nSGE is aiding the performance of GOOGL’s advertisement business by helping in the creation of relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company’s momentum among advertisers. The improving performance of YouTube ads is another positive.\r\n\r\nThis apart, the strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is a tailwind. Google’s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are positive.\n\nWaymo Expansion Efforts Boost Prospects\n\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\n\nWaymo’s strong operations in Phoenix, AZ, are a major positive.\n\nThe company’s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies UBER to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter’s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is noteworthy. This deal is in sync with the company’s deepening focus in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe company also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\r\n\r\nApart from Phoenix, Alphabet made Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco. This move marks Waymo’s very first such expansion outside of Phoenix.\r\n\r\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles. It is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year. \r\n\r\nWaymo recently expanded its partnership with Uber to introduce the Waymo One experience in Austin and Atlanta via the Uber app. The service will begin in the early 2025.\n\nRising Estimates Reflect Upside Potential in GOOGL Stock\n\nAlphabet’s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company’s strength in search and YouTube, which are driving its advertisement revenues, is a positive. Also, its growing momentum in Waymo is a plus. All these factors are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $292.3 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14%. \r\n\r\nThe same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this data-driven world, wherein AI has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet’s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Moreover, the company’s dominant position in the search engine market and first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space are major positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, growing litigation issues related to privacy concerns and AI technology, along with intensifying competition in both AI and autonomous driving fields, do not bode well for the stock.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "title": "Microsoft: Cloud and AI Will Bring the Stock to New Highs",
        "content": "Microsoft has regularly outpaced the stock market, more than tripling over the past five years. The stock is a little less than 10% removed from its all-time high, but it won’t be like that for long. Microsoft Cloud and the company’s AI initiatives prompt me to be bullish on the stock. These two parts of Microsoft’s business can help the stock reach a new high.\n\nMicrosoft Is Gaining Ground On AWS\n\nTo begin with, Microsoft isn’t the only cloud giant in town, but it’s gaining ground on the largest cloud provider, warranting a bullish stance. Microsoft now has a 25% market share in the cloud computing industry. It’s an improvement that narrows the gap with Amazon (AMZN). AWS is currently the largest cloud platform and has 31% of the market. Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a distant third place, with 11% of the total market share.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft gained even more ground in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue grew by 21% year-over-year in Q4 FY24, while AWS revenue only increased by 19% year-over-year in Q2 2024. If Microsoft maintains an elevated growth rate compared to AWS, it can continue to gain market share.\n\nIn addition, more market share is good in any industry, but it’s even better in a growing industry. Artificial intelligence should result in more demand for cloud platforms. These platforms offer a pathway for many businesses to use generative AI. Microsoft also regularly updates its cloud platform with new AI features that help it stand out from the competition.\n\nMicrosoft Investors Get More Exposure to Cloud Computing\n\nThe unique angle with Microsoft compared to other tech giants in the cloud industry is that most of Microsoft’s revenue comes from cloud computing. That’s another reason for my bullishness since cloud computing is a promising industry.\n\nWhat’s important to note is that cloud revenue makes up less than 20% of total revenue for Amazon (as seen below in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool) and Alphabet. Investors in those stocks are getting limited exposure to cloud computing since the other components of those companies generate most of the revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft regularly pulls in more than half of its revenue from cloud computing – as seen in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool below. The tech giant generated $64.7 billion in Q4 FY24, which was up by 15% year-over-year. Diving deeper into the numbers, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in the quarter, up by 21% year-over-year. That’s almost 60% of total revenue.\n\nMicrosoft Is Leading in Artificial Intelligence\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gave the company a head start in artificial intelligence, but the cloud platform isn’t the only AI catalyst. Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI and the release of Copilot are some of the reasons I’m bullish. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the Q4 FY24 results to emphasize Microsoft’s desire to ensure it is leading the AI era.\n\nAdditionally, while tech giants have been catching up, Microsoft has done a good job at incorporating AI across its offerings. For instance, you can find autogenerated suggestions underneath LinkedIn posts. Microsoft Copilot also helps boost productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks across Microsoft products. The tech giant also revealed Copilot for Security earlier this year, which makes cybersecurity more accessible to small businesses.\n\nAlthough Microsoft was always bound to cede some of its market share to rivals, the tech giant’s first-mover advantage suggests that it can maintain its current position. As the AI pie continues to grow, Microsoft should report elevated revenue and net income growth.\n\nIt’s Not Just AI and Cloud Computing\n\nWhile AI and cloud computing are the main reasons to be bullish about Microsoft, it also has other business segments that continue to perform well. For instance, LinkedIn delivered 10% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. The social network has become a top resource for business professionals who want to grow their careers and build their networks.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft delivered 19% year-over-year revenue growth for search and news advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Microsoft also fortified its position in the gaming industry with its Activision Blizzard acquisition. As a result, Xbox revenue jumped by 61% year-over-year, with Activision Blizzard contributing 58 percentage points to the growth rate.\n\nOverall, Microsoft’s well-diversified business is hard to find among other publicly traded corporations.

        "title": "Why Alphabet (GOOGL) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term",
        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nGOOGL sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Momentum Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. The stock is up 0.4% and up 0.6% over the past one-week and four-week period, respectively, and Alphabet has gained 23% in the last one-year period as well. Additionally, an average of 25,661,262 shares were traded over the last 20 trading sessions.\n\nMomentum investors don't just pay attention to price changes; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. One analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $7.63 per share. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.6%.\n\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding GOOGL to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Can Warner Bros. Discovery's Rich Partner Base Push the Stock Higher?",
        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery’s WBD rich partner base that includes Alphabet GOOGL, Charter Communications CHTR, Esports World Cup Foundation, SF Studios, Stan Sport and others, bodes well for its prospects.\r\n\r\nPartnerships with these companies are helping WBD to offer solid content to its user base that eventually drives top-line growth.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in partnership with Alphabet’s Google Cloud, WBD announced the implementation of AI-powered captioning solution on Tuesday. \r\n\r\nIt recently inked a distribution agreement with Charter, the largest distributor of Pay-TV in the United States. WBD’s partnership with Soudah Development is expected to expand its footprint in Saudi Arabia.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and Consensus Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. Quote\n\nWBD’s Caption AI to Aid Better Resource Utilization\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery will integrate a captioning solution by using Google’s Vertix AI in Max video streaming platform and unscripted programs like sports and reality TV. \r\n\r\nMax offers a diverse portfolio of entertainment series, including hits like Games of Thrones and The Last of Us. MAX is present in 65 international markets and can leverage the benefit of Caption AI to cater to diverse global viewers.\r\n\r\nCaption AI is a significant implementation by WBD as it will make the captioning process less labor-intensive. This deployment will transform WBD’s ways of creating and projecting captions.\r\n\r\nCaption AI will use generative AI to convert video content into text and will consistently refine and train the caption AI workflow to reduce errors and increase precision.\r\n\r\nWarner Bros. Discovery expects caption AI to take 80% less time and 50% less cost than before once the solution is deployed. It will aid WBD to produce closed captions, given various accents and dialects represented on the vast content portfolio.\n\nCharter Partnership Helps WBD Negate NBA Loss\n\nCharter signed a pact with WBD to increase the overall fee that it pays to broadcast Warner Channels. In return, Charter customers will have access to WBD’s Max and Discovery+ streaming platforms for free. \r\n\r\nWBD’s agreement with Charter is a strategic move undertaken by WBD to aid in reaching Charter’s 57 million customers. The deal is also expected to help it negate the loss of NBA partnership.\r\n\r\nWBD expects to reach its EBITDA target of more than $1 billion for fiscal 2025 by increasing its customer base with the Charter Agreement, leading to subscriber revenue improvement, delivery of more personalized content and reduced expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nCan an Expanding Partner Base Aid WBD’s Prospects?\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery shares have dipped 27% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s return of 3%.\r\n\r\nWBD shares have also lagged the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry and its peers Netflix NFLX and Fox (FOXA). \r\n\r\nOver the same time frame, shares of Netflix and Fox have gained 46.2% and 42.6%, respectively. The industry appreciated 26.5%.\r\n\r\nWBD’s underperformance can be attributed to sluggishness in the linear advertising market and uncertainties related to sports and affiliate rights. In the first half of 2024, WBD revenues fell 7.1% year over year to $19.6 billion.\r\n\r\nWBD is initiating significant restructuring reforms, including strategic content programming assessments and facility consolidation activities, to achieve cost-effectiveness. WBD expects these reforms to be completed by the end of fiscal 2024. \r\n\r\nThe expanding partner base is expected to boost WBD’s top-line growth and profitability in the long run.\n\nWBD’s 2024 Estimates Trending Down\n\nFor 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $40.44 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 2.13%. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 loss is pegged at $4.47 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. WBD reported a loss of $1.28 per share in 2023.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 loss is currently pegged at 3 cents per share, wider by a penny over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $9.99 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.14%.\n\nWBD - To Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nWBD’s prospects benefit from strong direct-to-consumer business due to strong content. However, intense competition remains a concern.\r\n\r\nWBD shares are undervalued, as suggested by a Value Score of B. However, muted growth prospect in the near term is a headwind for investors.\r\n\r\nWBD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors may want to wait for a more favorable entry point. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Microsoft, Google, Meta Pave Path to AI Expansion, Nvidia and Broadcom Set to Reap Benefits\n\nThe quarterly performance of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) adequately reflects that the artificial intelligence wave is in no mood to slow down in the near term.\n\nHyperscalers, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) remain aggressively invested in their artificial intelligence ambitions. The U.S. and China’s key rate cuts also added an additional tailwind for the capital-intensive industry.\n\nMicrosoft committed 14.7 billion Reais ($2.70 billion) over three years to Brazil’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to a Reuters report.\n\nAlso Read: Micron’s AI-Driven HBM Demand and Data Center Growth to Fuel Stock Upside, Analysts Say\n\nThe company’s ConectAI program will train 5 million people with AI skills over the next three years. Microsoft already has two Azure regions: one in São Paulo state, which it launched in 2014, and another in Rio de Janeiro, which it launched in 2020.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft earmarked $1.3 billion over the next three years to drive Mexico’s AI infrastructure and initiatives, including training 5 million people. Microsoft also collaborated with BlackRock, Inc (NYSE:BLK) and other partners, forging a fresh $30 billion investment fund to tap the AI wave.\n\nGoogle is eyeing a $3.3 billion investment in South Carolina to build two new data centers. The search engine giant’s plans included two new data center campuses in Dorchester County and expanding its existing data center campus in Berkeley County, Reuters cites the South Carolina governor’s office as saying.\n\nAlphabet committed $2 billion to the Dorchester County facilities, potentially creating 200 new operational jobs. According to Reuters, the company also earmarked $1.3 billion for Berkeley County.\n\nAnother positive update for the industry is the report indicating struggling chipmaker Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and the U.S. government are trying to finalize the $8.5 billion in direct funding for the chipmaker before the end of the year.\n\nTherefore, Intel’s exploration of stake sales to companies like Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) could also disrupt its chances of bagging the subsidy over antitrust grounds. Intel had already faced Senator scrutiny over its cost-cutting measures as the subsidy aims to create additional U.S. jobs.\n\nSemiconductor ETFs VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) gained 5%-6% in the last 5 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock is up 1.21% to $24.21 premarket at last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMeta Analysts Highlight AI, VR Advances, See Growth Pushing It Toward Apple-Like Valuation\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nAdvances in AI could trigger unwelcome outcomes for investors in the future.\n\nAs AI advances speed up markets and also create more complex trading models, a lot of stocks may become overcrowded in the search for alpha — and at risk for swift downdrafts if information changes, warns Tradeweb Markets (TW) CEO Billy Hult.\n\n\"It's something [we have] to think through,\" Hult told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nCrowded trades occur when similar investment strategies — usually fueled by complex trading models —send investors all into the same stocks. Shares of the overcrowded stocks tend to rise as the bulls rush in with reckless abandon, and little attention is paid to a company's valuation.\n\nLiquidity shortages, spikes in volatility, and short squeezes are some risks that come with crowded trades.\n\nThe other risk is that the stocks could get hammered significantly if information changes, sending everyone headed for the exit all at once.\n\nThe latest example: the swift sell-off in markets in early August.\n\nBank of America strategists said in a report at the time that “crowding risk mattered,” and it saw “the least crowded stocks outperforming the most crowded by eight percentage points.”\n\nThe Magnificent 7 tech stocks rose again in popularity this summer, as AI chips powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) enjoyed a brief stay as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nPros like Hult argue this type of crowding into top-performing stocks will only worsen as AI makes markets more sophisticated.\n\nProponents of AI envision, however, a world where traders are better informed through deeper insight gathered from a variety of sources.\n\n“I think we’re going to continue to see data driven execution in fixed income trading. And we're going to continue to see machine learning get applied to, sort of how the search for liquidity occurs in fixed income,” said Hult. “The next level of technology is going to be more sophisticated.”\n\nHult is a longtime evangelist of integrating finance, investment vehicles, and revolutionary technology. As a builder of electronic marketplaces, Tradeweb has worked with firms that seek to unite investors and machines. But it also stays true to the need for softer people skills.\n\n“[Tradeweb] has lived and breathed in the ethos of the market for a long time,” Hult said. “We really value the personal relationship side of the business.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\n\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\n\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\n\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\n\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\n\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\n\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

It owns a wide range of products and platforms, such as Google Search, Google Maps, Google Cloud, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, and more. It is one of the world’s largest tech companies by revenue.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database, 165 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of Q2 2024, making it one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. During the second quarter of the year, the company reported EPS of $1.89, beating expectations of $1.85 per share. Consolidated revenues totaled $84.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Net income was recorded at $23.6 billion. These robust results were led by a strong performance from Google Search and Google Cloud.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Cloud business crossed the $10 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time and posted $1 billion in operating profit – which was also a first. Revenues within Google Services reached $73.9 billion, up from $66.2 billion during the same quarter in 2023. The 'Google Search & Other' segment revenue totaled $48.5 billion, while YouTube and Google Network generated $8.7 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, in revenues during the quarter. These results reflect the fast pace of growth in the company and have helped garner investor confidence. The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) – GOOG was a top performer this quarter as it reported strong Search revenue, tighter cost controls, and momentum in Cloud. Both direct and brand Search ads were better than expected and the strength in YouTube monetization continues. Expense controls have translated to 700bps of margin improvement. Management is removing layers to improve efficiency, which should drive margins higher. GOOG also provided details on paths to monetize Al for advertisers. GOOG initiated a dividend during the quarter to return additional cash to shareholders. It has a solid balance sheet, a significant market share, and generates strong returns.\n\nThe future outlook for the company looks solid, with consensus among analysts on the stock’s Buy rating. It also has a share price target of $198, representing a 21% upside from its current level. There are also reports of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) negotiating a $23 billion acquisition of Wiz, a cybersecurity firm, that offers AI automation of tasks, threat detection, and vulnerability analysis. If the deal goes through, it will open the doors for the company in the cloud-native security arena by boosting its Mandiant cybersecurity platform.\n\nHowever, a recent defeat in an anti-trust lawsuit, where the Federal Court judge called Alphabet a ‘monopoly’ has come as a setback for the company. Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Alphabet stifled competition in the online search market to maintain its monopoly. This has led to some bearish sentiment around the stock, as it has hurt the company’s reputation and can also result in billions of dollars in hefty fines or legal settlements.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 1 Spectacular Stock You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is the head of Ark Investment Management, which operates a family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology stocks. Last year, Wood said software companies could be the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. She predicts they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 they spend on AI data center chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nAnd Wood has put her money where her mouth is. Since making that call, she has piled into AI software companies like xAI, Anthropic, and OpenAI through the private Ark Venture Fund. Plus, Ark's ETFs hold several AI software stocks, including Tesla, Palantir, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.\n\nIf Wood is ultimately right about AI software companies, here's why Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be among the biggest winners. Image source: Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet is transforming Google Search using AI\n\nAlphabet is a tech conglomerate that is home to Google, YouTube, self-driving vehicle company Waymo, and a host of other businesses. Google Search accounted for more than half of Alphabet's $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2024, driven by its 90% market share in the internet search industry. But that dominance faces its greatest-ever test because of AI.\n\nAI chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, provide direct responses to users' queries, giving them rapid access to information on almost any topic. Google, on the other hand, requires users to sift through web pages to find the information they need and generates revenue by charging businesses money to promote their websites in the search results. As a result, the traditional search model is very important for Alphabet.\n\nBut rather than defend what could eventually become obsolete, Alphabet decided to make drastic changes. In many cases, users who run Google Search queries will now receive AI-generated, text-based responses above the web search results to give them faster access to information. Google also launched AI Overviews earlier this year, taking that concept a step further.\n\nOverviews incorporate text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide more complete answers to prompts within Search. Plus, with the click of a button, the user can simplify or break down responses to gain a better understanding of the content. Alphabet has already discovered that links within Overviews receive more clicks compared to the same links in the traditional search format, so this new feature could be a big driver of advertising revenue in the future.\n\nOn top of that, Alphabet now offers its own family of AI models called Gemini (and a chatbot with the same name), which can answer complex questions and generate content like text and images. For an additional fee, Gemini is already available as an add-on in Google Workspace, which is home to productivity apps such as Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. As a result, it could become a powerful driver of subscription-based revenue over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Cloud is Alphabet's fastest-growing business\n\nSearch might be Alphabet's largest business, but Google Cloud is growing at twice the pace. It generated a record $10.3 billion in revenue during the 2024 second quarter, a 29% increase from the year-ago period -- compared to 13.7% growth in Search.\n\nGoogle Cloud provides a portfolio of services to help businesses succeed in the digital age, such as data storage, web hosting, and software development tools, among others. However, the platform has also become a leading provider of AI services.\n\nDevelopers can access the computing power they need to create AI software through Google Cloud's data centers. To accelerate their progress, they can even use the latest ready-made large language models (LLMs). That includes Gemini and over 130 others from leading start-ups and third-party developers.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also designing its own data center chips to give AI software developers more choices, which helps differentiate the platform from other cloud providers that rely primarily on suppliers like Nvidia. Google recently launched its sixth-generation tensor processing unit (TPU) called Trillium, which achieves almost five times the peak computing performance of the previous generation.\n\nMost AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, so faster chips can substantially reduce costs. Plus, circling back to Wood's forecast, if Google makes its own chips at scale, the payoff could be significantly larger when it uses them to create software -- or leases them to other developers -- because it won't have to send billions of dollars to suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nAlphabet stock is cheap, but there is one big caveat\n\nAlphabet generated $6.97 in earnings per share during the past four quarters, and based on its stock price of $161.85 as of this writing, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.2. That makes Alphabet the cheapest of all the U.S. technology companies valued at $1 trillion or more: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nBut there is one glaring problem, and it has nothing to do with the company's growth or its position as an AI powerhouse.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet in 2020, alleging the company engaged in monopolistic practices by paying Apple as much as $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine on its devices. Unfortunately for Alphabet, the judge in the case handed down a decision last month and sided with the DOJ.\n\nIt's unclear what the consequences will be. Alphabet might have to pay a financial penalty, or the government could force a breakup of the entire company. The latter would create significant uncertainty for investors because Alphabet would likely have to sell certain parts of its business to satisfy the DOJ that it won't engage in anti-competitive behavior in the future.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts say a breakup would be an extreme and unlikely outcome. Technology analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities thinks Alphabet will reach a settlement with the DOJ within the next 18 months to bring the matter to a close. That could involve a financial penalty and some changes to how Alphabet structures deals with its partners.\n\nAbsent a settlement, it could take years to reach a final resolution while Alphabet appeals the judge's decision, so the status-quo should prevail for now. Therefore, Alphabet stock looks like a great value at the current price, and if the company does emerge from this regulatory situation intact, it could look like an absolute bargain, considering Cathie Wood's AI software forecast.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Why Are Billionaires Bullish on This Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don’t waste time with underperformers—they target the market's elite.\n\nThe Stock Market Rally\n\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%–5.00% from 5.25%–5.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024—the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\n“Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we’re on our way back to 2%. So I don’t think you’re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.”\n\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed’s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\n\nWhat the Top Dogs of Wall Street are Saying About the Market\n\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 34\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech giant operating through segments including Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The company offers a wide range of products, including ads, Android, Chrome, Search, and YouTube, and continues to dominate the search market while integrating artificial intelligence to enhance user experiences.\n\nEvercore ISI recently revised its price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), lowering it from $225 to $200, but maintained its Outperform rating. The revision is linked to concerns about the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust trials and potential remedies that could see Google lose 20% to 50%+ of its U.S. search market share. However, Evercore ISI believes the impact on Alphabet’s earnings per share would be minimal, with a potential market share loss of 60% only affecting EPS by a single-digit percentage, thanks to savings on Traffic Acquisition Costs.\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a 14% increase in total revenue, reaching $84.74 billion. YouTube generated $8.7 billion in advertising revenue, up 13% year-over-year, while Google Cloud saw a 29% jump in revenue, surpassing $10 billion. With a solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has initiated dividend payments, confirming a $0.20 dividend with a 0.49% yield as of September 23.\n\nAs of the end of Q2 2024, 34 billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with a combined value of $13.4 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe that there are under-the-radar AI stocks trading at highly discounted valuations that hold greater promise for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "China’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t",
        "content": "Wall Street mega investors have recently made Chinese stocks their home for billions, especially as the government takes new stimulus measures. Cutting rates places stocks like Alibaba and Baidu in a much better position than their peers, Amazon and Google. Wall Street analysts agree with this setup, placing double-digit upside potential in these stocks for the coming quarters.\n\nEven though the Chinese stock market has been scrutinized extensively in the past couple of years, some investors have begun to realize that there is much more upside than apparent risk for Asia’s powerhouse. China’s technology sector has the lowest valuation in history compared to its American counterpart.\n\nMeasured through the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB), names in this space now trade at steep discounts against peers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). While discounted stocks might not look attractive to some investors based on their price action, others recognize the value to be had in them.\n\nThis is why stocks like Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and the overall iShares MSCI China ETF have delivered shareholders a significant rally this week, one of the best performances since the few months after the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail investors can also feel a bit safer because some of Wall Street’s favorite investors have also given these companies a chance to make billions.\n\nChinese Government Interventions Improve the Risk-Reward Balance for Investors\n\nRecently, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) in the United States decided to lower interest rates by half a percent, or 50 basis points. The Chinese economy has been criticized long enough for its slowdown and contractions, so the government has also decided to cut rates by the same amount.\n\nThe difference is that the Chinese ETF trades at only 47% of the high prices it made in early 2021, while the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index trades at 96% of its 52-week high now. This means that the potential reward is much bigger in China than the pullback the U.S. technology space could make after these runs.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller decided to sell out of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after realizing the potential upside was no longer that attractive; it is no surprise to see his former mentor and boss George Soros initiate a $73.4 million position in Alibaba.\n\nAs lower rates start to spread through the Chinese economy, the consumer discretionary sector and rate-dependent technology companies will probably see the benefits first, so they have become the top choice for other mega investors as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWho’s Buying Chinese Stocks Now and What They’re Adding to Their Portfolios\n\nSome investors would recognize him for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, but Michael Burry has now made Alibaba his top holding. After buying it for the better part of 2024, Burry’s portfolio is now reported to hold up to 155,000 shares valued at roughly $14.8 million today.\n\nThe trend doesn’t end there for Burry, as he also chose Baidu as his fourth-largest position, with 75,000 shares valued at approximately $9 million. Coming right after Baidu, Burry chose JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to be his fifth-largest position, with 250,000 shares carrying a value of $8.3 million today.\n\nThose names are the common choice among investors today. David Tepper has recently deviated from his typical picks in the financial and technology sector to pick on Chinese stocks. For Tepper, his fund bought up to 10,500,000 shares for an approximate value of just over $1 billion in the portfolio.\n\nConsidering that Alibaba trades at less than a third of the $316 a share high it made after COVID-19, it makes sense for these investors to look at the potential risk-to-reward ratios and decide if it is worth taking a risk on Chinese stocks.\n\nWall Street’s Latest Take on Alibaba and Baidu: Key Insights for Investors\n\nStarting with Alibaba, analysts now justify a consensus price target of $107.6 a share on the stock, calling for 12.7% upside from where it trades today. However, those at Susquehanna decided to go above and beyond the consensus and place a $130 valuation on Alibaba, implying it could run by a much bigger 35.4% from today’s price.\n\nWhen it comes to Baidu, the stock trades at only 68% of its 52-week high to offer enough potential upside to consider it. This is why analysts at Citigroup see a potential case for the stock to trade as high as $155 a share, daring the stock to stage a massive 64.8% rally from where it has traded down to today.\n\nHere are other insights for investors to consider: Alibaba’s main competitor could be assumed to be Amazon, which is why the Chinese giant’s 25.1x P/E ratio means a significant discount to Amazon’s 46.0x valuation today. For Baidu, competition can only arguably be found in shares of Google.\n\nBaidu’s 12.4x P/E valuation would also offer investors a steep discount compared to Google’s valuation of 23.3x P/E today, despite a recent selloff in that stock. When it comes to upside and diminished risk, investors all over are finding Chinese stocks to be the winners; maybe retail investors should, too.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t\n\nWhy Small-Cap Stocks Could Be Ready to Outperform After Rate Cuts\n\nHealthcare Stocks Poised to Shine?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\n\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\n\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "title": "Big Tech Taps Ties to Republican Lawmakers to Stall Child Safety Bill",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Top House Republicans are stalling landmark US legislation that would protect children from online exploitation and bullying, bowing to criticisms from Big Tech and exposing a rift within the party over regulating social media.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\nThe legislation, the Kids Online Safety Act, passed the Senate on a 91-3 vote in July and President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it into law. But House GOP leaders, as well as several other Republican lawmakers, have raised concerns that it’s too heavy handed and could sideline some conservative content online.\n\nThe emotionally charged debate over the legislation has laid bare the resilience of tech companies’ political power in the face of growing public concerns about social media’s harmful effects on young people. And it illustrates the value of well-connected allies in Washington at a moment of public outcry.\n\nAmazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Meta Platforms Inc. have sought to leverage their connections to influential lawmakers like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise in a lobbying push that tars the legislation as an attack on free speech rights, suggesting it would silence voices on both ends of the political spectrum. Top Democrats like Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey also have been a focus of the lobbying effort.\n\nThose tech companies, which did not respond to requests for comment, are up against a coalition of parents whose children died or were seriously hurt in incidents related to online activity. The parents have waged their own passionate lobbying campaign, sharing wrenching personal stories with lawmakers and congressional staff.\n\nThe legislation threatens to bring down tech companies’ ad revenue by weakening design features that hook young users and keep them active on online platforms, said Matthew Schettenhelm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows the sector.\n\nPerhaps more alarming to Big Tech, it could break the long-standing political logjam that has kept Congress from acting on internet legislation, opening the way to more disruptive actions such as a comprehensive data privacy law or changes in tech companies’ liability protection for online content, Schettenhelm said.\n\nThe debate over online safety pits a House committee chairwoman and former member of GOP leadership against her party’s own leaders, essentially leaving Republicans with no united path forward and decreasing the odds of a bipartisan deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOP Divide\n\nCommerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers kicked off a recent committee debate on the legislation in tears as she held up images of children who died in incidents related to social media. Wiping her nose, she recited their names, then passed around a folder with dozens more stories about children who died under similar circumstances.\n\nBut then many of McMorris Rodgers’ Republican colleagues dismantled the Senate-passed legislation. They swapped in language that was shared only the evening before, leaving the bill’s supporters little time to review.\n\nDemocrats described the revamped legislation as a “watered down” eleventh-hour push that would gut the “duty of care,” a key provision that would force tech companies to take responsibility for the harmful posts they recommend to children.\n\nEven with the scaled back language, Scalise and other conservative Republicans who had opposed the original version haven’t endorsed the revised legislation. The House left Washington Wednesday to go on break until after the November election, and there’s no plan to bring the bill to the floor in the year-end lameduck session.\n\nBehind the Scenes\n\nScalise, a Louisiana congressman with close ties to tech companies, signaled before the committee meeting he wouldn’t allow a House vote on the legislation unless key provisions were changed, according to Republican congressional aides familiar with the matter who were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nScalise is the second-ranking Republican leader and has broad sway over what legislation gets a House vote.\n\nThe majority leader won concessions from the bill’s lead Republican sponsor narrowing the harms tech companies had to mitigate so that the duty only would apply to material promoting “inherently dangerous acts that are likely to cause serious bodily harm, serious emotional disturbance or death.”\n\nScalise and House Speaker Mike Johnson still aren’t satisfied. Even with the changes made to the legislation, the Republican leaders want more concessions before they will allow a House vote, a GOP leadership aide said.\n\nThe No. 2 Republican leader continues to object to creating a “duty of care” for material online platforms recommend to children, and also opposes giving the Federal Trade Commission power to enforce the law, according the leadership aide. Advocates say both are crucial to the bill’s effectiveness.\n\nLaura Marquez-Garrett, a lawyer for some of the parent advocates, casts Scalise’s opposition to the tougher restrictions that passed the Senate as him “choosing Big Tech money over children.”\n\nLauren Fine, a Scalise spokesperson, said the House majority leader is merely trying to address legitimate concerns shared by some other Republican lawmakers, including the possibility the law could lead tech companies to curtail distribution of some conservative material.\n\n“We must protect kids and create a safer environment online, so it is critical that we get this right,” Fine said. “We should empower parents - not the government - to protect their kids online.”\n\nFine referred questions about political donations to the lawmaker’s campaign. A representative for the campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for a statement.\n\nJohnson spokeswoman Athina Lawson said the speaker “has been and continues to be open to working through member concerns related to the bill.”\n\nThe hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus has raised similar concerns, including worries of censorship of anti-abortion and other conservative material. Some left-leaning groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, and LGBTQ+ groups also have expressed concerns the legislation could lead social media companies to censor content.\n\nPallone, the Commerce Committee’s top-ranking Democrat, has opposed the bill, arguing that LGBTQ+ children “could lose access to helpful and even life-saving content.” The New Jersey Democrat has received over $88,500 from the Google, Amazon, Meta and TechNet PACs since he joined the committee in 2015.\n\nA spokesman for Pallone said the contributions played no role in the congressman’s consideration of the matter, adding Pallone has “consistently fought to hold Big Tech accountable.”\n\nClose Ties\n\nScalise, a prolific fundraiser and reliable ally of business, has accumulated more political donations from the bill’s Big Tech opponents during his congressional career than anyone else in the current Republican House leadership, according to Federal Election Commission reports.\n\nSince 2011, Scalise has raised $198,000 from the political action committees of Amazon, Google and Meta. The money benefited his campaign, leadership PAC, and, through his joint fundraising vehicle, the National Republican Congressional Committee and other GOP House campaigns.\n\nAn ambitious politician who tried and failed to win the speakership last year, Scalise has spent the past year and a half raising money for a new fundraising apparatus that could help him build support if he mounts another bid.\n\nGoogle’s political action committee was one of the top corporate donors to his Scalise Leadership Fund, doling out $36,000 to the fund in 2024 alone, according to FEC records. Greg Maurer, a public policy director at Meta, gave the Scalise Leadership Fund $10,000 in March, while Meta public policy director Christopher Herndon gave $1,000, according to FEC records.\n\nSeveral of Scalise’s former top aides have moved directly from his staff to lucrative tech industry lobbying jobs. Matt Bravo, Scalise’s former director of floor operations, is now a partner at lobbying firm S-3 and one of the most active lobbyists opposing the legislation. Bravo’s clients include Google and tech trade group NetChoice, which have both lobbied aggressively against the online safety bill.\n\nBravo circulated a memo to conservative lawmakers arguing online safety legislation would lead social media platforms to censor anti-abortion material, a sensitive issue on the right, said two congressional aides who viewed the correspondence. He has spent months lobbying against the legislation.\n\nBravo did not respond to requests for comment sent by email and left on his phone voicemail.\n\nFight Continues\n\nTime is against the bill’s supporters, with only three months left in the current Congress. Republican leaders have now referred the bill to the House Education Committee for more review.\n\nBefore the vote in McMorris Rodgers’ Commerce Committee, lobbyists sent memos to lawmakers seeking to ensnare the bill in bitter social-issue fights.\n\nOne memo, circulated by the Republican tech lobbyists, portrayed the bill as a “wolf in sheep’s clothing for the pro-life movement,” claiming it would allow the FTC to crack down on anti-abortion speech online.\n\nAnother letter shared by Democratic tech lobbyists said the bill could result in the government forcing social media companies to remove pro-LGBTQ+ content online.\n\n“The tech companies are doing everything they can to play both sides, as they have been from the beginning,” said Jon Schweppe, policy director of the American Principles Project, a conservative group that supports the measure.\n\nIssue One, an advocacy group that favors the online safety legislation, last week began running tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of ads in Louisiana, Scalise and Johnson’s home state, urging them to pass the bill.\n\nThe ad features a clip of testimony from the mother of Carson Bride, who died by suicide after being cyberbullied online. “We are done with the hearings, we are done with the stories — we are looking for action,” she says.\n\n--With assistance from Bill Allison.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft The End of the Cheap Burger This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "title": "Google expert at antitrust trial says government underestimates competition for online ad dollars",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va, (AP) — Federal regulators who say Google holds an illegal monopoly over the technology that matches online advertisers to publishers are vastly underestimating the competition the tech giant faces, an expert hired by Google testified Thursday.\n\nMark Israel, an economist who prepared an expert report on Google's behalf, said the government's claims that Google holds a monopoly over advertising technology are improperly focused on a narrow market the government defines as “open web display advertising,” essentially the rectangular ads that appear on the top and along the right hand side of a web page when a consumer browses the web on a desktop computer.\n\nBut the government's case fails to account for a variety of competition that occurs beyond those rectangular boxes, Israel said. In the real world, advertisers have dramatically shifted where they spend money to social media companies like Facebook and TikTok, and online retailers like Amazon.\n\nWhen you account for all online display advertising, not just the narrow segment defined by the government's case, Google gets just 10% of the U.S. market share as of 2022, he said. That's down from roughly 15% a decade ago.\n\nIn addition, advertisers have moved away from placing their ads on the screens of desktop and laptop computers where Google is alleged to control the market, with money migrating to ads placed on apps and mobile device screens. Israel cited marketing data showing display ad spending on desktop and laptop devices has decreased from 71% in 2013 to 17% in 2022.\n\nThe government's case “seems to miss where the competition is today,” Israel said.\n\nHis testimony comes as Google wraps up its defense in the third week of an antitrust trial that began earlier this month in Alexandria, Virginia. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema has said she expects the government will put on a short rebuttal case Friday. Then the trial will go on hiatus, with both sides submitting proposed findings of fact in November and returning to court to make closing arguments in December. She said she expects to make a ruling by the end of the year.\n\nThe government's case alleges Google has built and maintained an illegal monopoly that restricts choices and inflates costs for online publishers and advertisers. Its control of the market has allowed Google to keep 36 cents on the dollar for every ad bought and sold through its ad tech stack, the government claims.\n\nThe government says Google controls advertising tech at every step of the process, including the predominant technology used by publishers to sell their ad space, the predominant technology used by advertisers looking to purchase ad space, and the ad exchanges in the middle that conduct auctions in a matter of milliseconds to match advertiser to publisher.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe government's case contends that Google illegally ties those markets together, forcing publishers to use Google's technology if they want access to Google's large cache of advertisers.\n\nThe government, using more narrow market definitions than those used by Israel, has claimed that Google controls 91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertising ad networks.\n\nGoogle says the government's case also fails to account for the billions the company has invested to ensure its products, working together, generate better value for publishers and advertisers by matching the right advertisers to the right consumers.\n\nIsrael cited data showing publishers working with Google are generating more revenue for each bit of ad space they make available, while advertisers are paying less for each click their ads generate.\n\nThat only occurs, Israel said, because Google's technology is continually improving the quality of the ads by matching advertisers to consumers based on their interests and purchase history.\n\nIsrael also disputed the government's claims that Google gets 36 cents on the dollar for the ad sales it facilitates. He said data shows that percentage has dropped to 31% or 32% in recent years. More importantly, he said, competitors have even higher take rates, with an industry average of 42 cents on the dollar.\n\nThe Virginia trial is separate from another case brought by the government alleging that Google's ubiquitous search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly. In that case, a judge in the district of Columbia ruled in favor of the government and declared the search engine a monopoly, but no decision has yet been made on any potential remedies. The government is scheduled to offer suggestions of proposed remedies next month. those could include restricting Google from paying tech companies to lock in Google as the default search engine for gadgets like cellphones, or even seeking to force google to sell off parts of its business.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google's GV Invests $11M In Finnish Startup Revolutionizing Mixed-Reality Tech For Car Windshields And Cockpits\n\nIn a recent development, GV, the venture capital division of Google by Alphabet Inc, (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has invested in a Finnish startup, Distance Technologies, which is working on integrating mixed-reality technology into car windshields and airplane cockpits.\n\nWhat Happened: Distance Technologies has successfully raised 10 million euros ($11.1 million) in a seed funding round led by GV. The round also saw participation from other investors such as FOV Ventures and Maki.vc, CNBC reported on Thursday.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nDistance, based in Helsinki, is developing a technology that can transform any transparent surface into an augmented-reality display, eliminating the need for hardware like mixed-reality headsets or augmented reality glasses. The company’s technology uses tracking to identify where the user is looking and then computes the correct light field to match the exact positions of the user’s eyes.\n\nSee Also: Teens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company – Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\n\nWhy It Matters: This investment by GV in Distance Technologies is a significant move, considering Google’s renewed interest in the augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) market. Earlier this year, Google entered into a strategic partnership with Magic Leap, an augmented reality startup, to create immersive experiences that integrate the physical and digital realms. This partnership was aimed at leveraging Magic Leap’s expertise in optics and device manufacturing alongside Google’s advanced technology platforms.\n\nDistance’s technology, which is primarily focused on the auto, aerospace, and defense markets, could potentially revolutionize these sectors by creating a life-size field of view in any setting. This aligns with Google’s strategic direction in the AR/VR market and could potentially give it an edge over competitors like Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDon’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

        "content": "Meta stock (META) traded at a new all-time intraday high Thursday, following a developer event that put its artificial intelligence ambitions on display. Shares rose as high as $577 after the bell before edging down slightly to be up just under 1%, or around $573, mid-morning.\n\nAt Meta Connect 2024 on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Meta’s newest AI model, Llama 3.2. The tech giant also revealed its new “Orion” augmented reality glasses, as well as its latest Ray Ban smart glasses and mixed-reality Quest headset.\n\nMeta has raced to catch up with competitors in the AI space — fellow Big Tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as well as the startup and AI leader OpenAI. And while it’s not as popular as ChatGPT, Meta claimed in April that its AI has an equivalent of 185 million weekly active users, close behind ChatGPT’s 200 million.\n\nMeta released an AI model, Llama 3.1, this summer, which it claimed could outperform OpenAI’s models in several areas. Llama 3.2 is another stride forward for Meta as it looks to take on OpenAI and other AI players. It’s Meta’s first open-source model that can process images, charts, graphs, and text, and it will enable developers using Llama 3.2 to build more complex applications.\n\nThe company said Llama 3.2 is competitive with OpenAI’s GPT4o-mini and outperforms Google’s AI model Gemma by some metrics. And its AI assistant available on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook can now speak in the voices of celebrities including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta had “reached an inflection point in the industry” in which its AI model, Llama, is “starting to become something of an industry standard.” Mark Zuckerberg smiles while speaking at the Meta Connect conference Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Menlo Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnalysts contend that Meta is well-positioned among its competitors. “We believe Meta Connect reflected Meta’s ambitions to be one of the leading AI companies and to shape the industry,” wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a note to investors Thursday morning.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg showcased Meta's AI future at Meta Connect leaving us more bullish on Meta's consumer & enterprise AI opportunities,” wrote Jefferies analysts. “On the enterprise, Llama is becoming a serious contender and we see momentum building with its new multimodal capabilities.”\n\nBank of America analysts on Thursday raised its price target on the stock to $630. JPMorgan expects Meta shares to rise even higher, to $640, while Jefferies reiterated its price target of $600. The average Wall Street forecast for Meta's stock price over the next 12 months is a bit lower at $583, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 88% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock recommend buying it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it may take a while for Meta to reap the full benefits of its AI innovations. Jefferies analysts noted a “potential multi-year lag between investments and revenue” but said they are \"confident in Meta's proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Meta’s costly Reality Labs division, which works on its metaverse products, continues to lose the company billions of dollars. The team’s hefty spending has cost the company $50 billion so far, and JPMorgan analysts project Reality Labs will lose Meta another $23 billion in 2025.\n\nMeta may not have fully monetized its AI advancements just yet, but its moves in the AI space have certainly boosted its stock. Meta is part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks, which have rallied to unprecedented price levels over the past year. Meta stock is up by nearly 91% over the last year, including over 60% in 2024.

        "title": "All eyes are on Meta's smart glasses, but questions persist over its secretive AR project",
        "content": "Halfway through the keynote speech during the Meta (META) Connect event on Wednesday, Vice President of AR, Alex Himel, walked on stage with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.\n\n\"This is Orion,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced next to him, pulling out Meta's augmented reality glasses. \"Our first fully functioning prototype — and if I do say so, the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\"\n\nInvestors finally got a sneak peak of a moonshot from the money-losing Reality Labs division inside Meta. The project has been shrouded in secrecy, after nearly a decade of development and billions of dollars in research and build. It also arrives as Wall Street increasingly questions the spending at the division, after it burned through over $50 billion since 2020.\n\nZuckerberg hopes Orion can bridge the gap between the digital and real world, and eventually replace smartphones. But its debut may be further away than Meta bulls think.\n\nMeta has previously said it's targeting 2027 to begin shipping its long-awaited AR glasses. Yet several insiders who worked on the teams building Orion exclusively told Yahoo Finance that despite the product being \"magical\" and \"precious,\" it may never hit consumers' hands or give a return to Meta's investment.\n\nAccording to two former engineers with knowledge of the project, the initial goal was to build approximately 1,000 units, which quickly turned into only a few hundred. Out of those, people familiar with the project estimate fewer than twenty units actually turn on and show an image — taking the average cost of just the working prototypes into the \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars.\n\nZuckerberg's expectation was for some of the materials used to build Orion to drop in price over the last few years. That didn't happen as hoped (partly due to trade restrictions), meaning some of the materials will have to be changed for future versions to be financially sustainable.\n\n\"They don’t know whether the technology will work and whether it’ll ever work at the price point anyone can afford,\" said a former lead engineer who asked not to be identified. \"Right now, they don't have material that they can make this with at a reasonable cost.\"\n\nOrion is made up of three main parts: the glasses, a wristband, and a puck that powers the device's graphics and connectivity. The puck is referred to as the \"central compute,\" people familiar with the project said.\n\nIts chief materials are a silicon carbide wave-guide sandwiched between two protective lenses, seven cameras, two micro-LED projectors, and custom silicon — one of the more expensive parts of the product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe glasses also feature magnesium frames to help keep the weight down. According to people familiar with the project, the wave-guides each cost around $10,000.\n\nZuckerberg is aware of the challenges ahead. He ended his keynote saying they're focused on key changes to Orion before they offer it as a consumer product.\n\n\"For now, I think the right way to look at Orion is a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how committed Zuckerberg and Meta are to Orion. Former employees tell Yahoo Finance that Meta moved a significant portion of its AR development team from the Orion project into its Ray-Ban smart glasses division earlier this month.\n\nAnd investor questions on the overall outlook of Reality Labs are mounting. A dozen former high level employees previously told Yahoo Finance the division has been mired in mismanagement.\n\nIn a new note out Thursday following the event, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth projected Reality Labs losses of $19 billion in 2024 and $23 billion in 2025.\n\nReality Labs lost $16.1 billion in 2023, according to company filings, while contributing less than $2 billion to revenue. By comparison, the company's Family of Apps segment — which includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — pulled in $62.9 billion in profits.\n\n\"The potential for Meta to pull back on Reality Labs spending and losses has been a frequent topic in our recent discussions with investors. And while it’s difficult to discern between a shift of a few billions dollars, we don’t come away from Connect thinking that Meta will pare back Reality Labs losses,\" Anmuth said.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Analysis-Power thirst complicates ESG investors' love affair with tech stocks",
        "content": "By Isla Binnie\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who manage hundreds of billions of dollars are pressing Microsoft, Alphabet and others for more information on the power needed for artificial intelligence and advanced computing, to help decide whether the sector should stay heavily represented in sustainable funds, investors said.\n\nWhile these conversations are at an early stage, six fund industry executives in Europe and the United States said they are looking more closely at the environmental impact of the AI boom, which Goldman Sachs estimates will boost data center power demand 160% by 2030.\n\nNone of the investors contacted by Reuters said they were considering divesting.\n\nSome of the biggest tech companies leading the AI race that requires building and powering data centers have started reporting increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising questions from asset managers who want to show their portfolios do well not only financially but also by the environment. Tech's thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\n\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\n\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union's financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\n\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\n\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\n\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\n\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\n\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\n\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\n\nStory continues\n\nBIG SHIFT\n\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\n\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\n\nNordea's 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\n\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley's Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\n\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\n\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA CHALLENGE\n\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\n\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\n\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\n\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert's Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\n\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\n\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\n\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\n\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\n\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\n\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)\n\nView comments",

And on top of operations, the company faces other challenges, from upstart discount retailers to the nagging perception that it’s behind in the AI arms race.\n\nBut that last hurdle may have already been cleared.\n\nAnalysts say that Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, has invested heavily enough in catching up to the industry’s first mover, Microsoft (MSFT), that its position may even be advantageous. Amazon’s ability to deploy its own chips within its data centers — at a fraction of the cost of relying on Nvidia’s — is the key.\n\nAmazon, some analysts contend, has a leg up on its competitors on two fronts: first, over Microsoft, which was hit with a rare downgrade earlier this week for leaning too heavily on Nvidia's (NVDA) AI infrastructure. Or as Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance, “Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.” Andy Jassy on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on Nov. 30, 2022, in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) (Thos Robinson via Getty Images)\n\nJassy also seems to have an answer to recent grumblings over returns on investment as tech giants dedicate tens of billions of dollars to AI capital expenditures. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\n\nOf course, it’s still too early to say if something like “AI chip sovereignty,” the fancy word for vertical integration, will be a key factor in monetizing AI tools or if unseating Nvidia in the battle over chips will be all that useful. Amazon is taking a more “all are welcome” marketplace approach to large language models, offering customers an array of advanced models to choose from instead of peddling a single proprietary offering.\n\nSome on Wall Street see another short-term advantage over a different rival: Google. Pinched by the potential threat of ChatGPT disrupting a search-based business model, as well as ramped-up antitrust enforcement over search practices, Google carries near-term risks that make Amazon look more attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's stock is up close to 30% this year. Among its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" only Nvidia's staggering rise and Meta's (META) turnaround have outperformed.\n\nThe company is reportedly unveiling a new Alexa with AI as early as next month. Another positive jolt to Amazon's AI story might be the most powerful cultural shift there is.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): A Good Undervalued Blue Chip Stock to Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other undervalued blue chip stocks.\n\nKristen Bitterly, Head of Global Strategy at Citi, recently appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box and explained how inflation and employment trends played a role in recent decisions from the Fed. Bitterly stated that while they had anticipated a 25-basis point rate cut due to some sticky inflation data, especially around the owner's equivalent rent, she noted that the difference between a 25 or 50 basis point cut shouldn’t be overanalyzed. What matters most is the overall trajectory of rates moving forward, and as long as employment data remains stable, the Federal Reserve and the market are aiming for a soft landing.\n\nDiscussing rate cuts during a time of record stock market highs and low unemployment, Bitterly acknowledged the unusual timing. Typically, rate cuts happen during crises; however, she suggested that the Federal Reserve may be trying to stay ahead of a potential slowdown. She highlighted that the Fed’s main focus is on employment and price stability, not necessarily on stock market highs. Now that inflation is somewhat under control, the focus has shifted to keeping unemployment around 4%.\n\nWhen asked about potential inflation risks, Bitterly mentioned ongoing infrastructure, CHIPS Act, and IRA spending, which could indeed lead to inflationary pressures. While the Fed’s projections may be too optimistic about inflation falling to 2.5%, she pointed out that we’re dealing more with disinflation rather than deflation.\n\n\"When we look at the Statement of Economic Projections, you might be right—they could be too aggressive in predicting where inflation will be. It might hover around 2.5%, and that could be sustainable in the near future. We’re not talking about deflation, just disinflation. The price increases we've seen are still there, even if inflation is coming down.\"\n\nOn the strength of retail sales, Bitterly highlighted a strong economic backdrop, noting $6.5 trillion in money market funds, decreasing inflation, and record profitability among U.S. companies. Despite concerns like election volatility, she believes there’s still significant capital looking to enter the market, making for a favorable outlook. Bitterly predicted that the S&P 500 would likely finish the year higher, although October might be challenging due to election-related uncertainty. Historically, election years see a dip in October as investors take profits, but a rally usually follows once election results are clear.\n\nLooking ahead to next year, she expects a return to fundamentals. With 10 out of 11 sectors anticipated to show earnings growth this year, and possibly all sectors growing in 2025, she emphasized that tariffs and taxation are important factors, but ultimately driven by policy rather than politics.\n\n\"Next year, we return to fundamentals. After the election, we focus on fundamentals. This year, we expect 10 out of 11 sectors to show earnings growth, compared to 7 out of 11 last year, which was an earnings recession. It could be 11 out of 11 going into 2025. On the election front, people are looking at tariffs and taxation, but policy drives that more than politics.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we screened for large to mega cap stocks that were trading at a forward P/E of less than 20. We identified 20 blue chip stocks that met our criteria and then selected the stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2024, and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their upside potential, as of September 24.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nAnalyst Upside Potential: 25.41%\n\nForward P/E, as of September 24: 18.62\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders:  165\n\nRanking 1st in our list of the 7 undervalued blue chip stocks to buy right now is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Q2 2024 results were driven by robust growth in its Google Cloud segment, which expanded by 28%. Its core search business remains resilient despite macroeconomic headwinds. A key driver of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s future growth is its substantial investment in AI, particularly through its Bard AI platform and enhancements to its cloud computing capabilities. This positions Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a frontrunner in the rapidly evolving AI sector, which is expected to transform various industries and create new revenue streams.\n\nWith a forward P/E ratio of 18.62 and a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s strong balance sheet provides it with the flexibility to continue investing in innovation while navigating economic uncertainties. Its leadership in digital advertising further reinforces its revenue-generating capabilities, making it well-equipped to adapt to changing market dynamics.\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s combination of strong financial performance, strategic investments in AI, and leadership in digital services supports a bullish outlook, positioning it favorably for long-term growth and investor value creation.\n\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock rose on the strength of robust first-quarter revenue growth underpinned by noteworthy gains in search advertising, YouTube advertising and the cloud business. Signs that the company is accelerating its development of AI solutions buoyed investor optimism.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st on our list of the undervalued blue chip stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Holding Company Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other holding company stocks.\n\n\"The Market is Anticipating Too Much\"\n\nSome may think the Fed meeting on the 18th of September may have put an end to the basis point cut debate, however, while the Fed did initiate a rate cut by half a percentage, two Fed meetings are remaining before the end of 2024. To discuss the likely rate cut path, Chris Versace, Tematica Research CIO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance on September 24.\n\nVersace suggests that it is quite impossible to predict the path the Fed is to adopt before 2024 ends and the decision will likely be more reliant on data. The labor market weakened for the second consecutive month and, according to him, the Fed will probably go for another 50 basis point cut, if not more.\n\nHe urges investors and traders to triangulate all data points to make decisions including economic data, inflation data, and the speed at which the economy is growing. Versace states that the market right now is stretched and that there is more to the bigger picture such as the upcoming elections, earnings growth, and the Fed's decisions.\n\n\"Volatility Should Remain Elevated\"\n\nOn September 25, Burns McKinney, NFJ Investment Group Managing Director & Senior Portfolio Manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market outlook. Amid declining consumer confidence and a shrinking job market, volatility, according to him, will remain a constant element.\n\nHe suggested that signs of job weakness coupled with inflation have impacted consumer confidence negatively, especially after the Fed's decision. McKinney added that there is a disequilibrium in the number of jobs vacant and the number of workers available right now, leading to weakened employment data.\n\nFrom an investor standpoint, he deems volatility a constant state of the market, given that the country also has an upcoming election in the coming weeks. In addition to that, geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East will likely add to the turmoil. McKinney shares that investors should focus more on dividend-paying stocks to remain secure and resilient through the volatility.\n\nDespite the turmoil, some stocks may always be promising given their strong footing and dominance in the industry. With that, let's take a look at the 10 best holding company stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best holding company stocks to buy now, we examined multiple rankings on the internet and our rankings. We then ranked the top 10 based on the largest number of hedge fund holders at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the best holding company stocks to buy now. The company owns several subsidiaries including Waymo, Verily, BufferBox, and Google.\n\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, launching its NVIDIA chip rival in May. In addition to that, the company saw significant growth in its computer hardware segment. While Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. Moreover, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\n\nOverall, the company’s new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud.\n\nOne can infer that the technology holding company is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment. Analysts 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, GOOGL was held by 216 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st on our list of the best holding company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "title": "Bullish on Alphabet, as Cloud Computing Is the New Growth Engine for the Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) stock has recovered quite nicely from the deep selloff it endured near the end of 2022, as its advertising channels continue to consistently deliver big numbers. While Alphabet still heavily depends on ad sales, the company’s new growth engine is Google Cloud. I’m bullish on both parts of the business, but Google Cloud offers more upside potential as the tech giant continues to gain ground on its peers.\n\nAdvertising Is Still the Main Engine\n\nAd revenue carries the bulk of the revenue load at Google, having generated $64.6 billion for the second quarter of 2024. That’s an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. Google Search and YouTube ads revenue jumped by 13.8% and 13.0% year-over-year, respectively. A bullish investor can take comfort in these numbers.\n\nGrowth in this segment is good for Alphabet’s profit margins, as the advertising segment is known for having high margins. Alphabet wrapped up the second quarter with a 27.9% net profit margin. Those margins will likely increase as the company delivers operational efficiencies including from cost cutting. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the company record a 30% net profit margin in at least one quarter in 2025 as profitability grows.\n\nAlphabet put itself in the spotlight when it announced its first dividend earlier this year. The yield is roughly 0.50%, and Alphabet will likely strive to make a further impression with a double-digit dividend hike in 2025.\n\nCloud Computing Will Fuel Future Growth\n\nThe results of Alphabet’s advertising division alone could make GOOGL stock attractive, but Google Cloud offers another reason to be bullish. This part of Alphabet’s business is growing much faster than its advertising segment, and it’s no longer a small offshoot like in previous years. Google Cloud revenue reached $10.4 billion in Q2, representing more than 12% of total revenue for the quarter.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s impact on future earnings reports will grow, and that’s good news for investors. Cloud revenue jumped by 28.8% year-over-year. That growth rate has been normal for Google Cloud, and its profitability is also improving. Google Cloud’s operating income almost tripled year-over-year, going from $395 million to $1.17 billion. Cloud profit margins have the potential to soar quickly, and the accelerated growth from this part of Alphabet’s business suggests higher profit margins are awaiting patient investors.\n\nAI Tailwinds Should Continue to Last\n\nAlphabet has a dominant position in artificial intelligence, a critical technology that can accelerate advertising and cloud revenue. The tech giant’s AI capabilities make me bullish. Alphabet is using AI to run better ads that maximize results for its customers. This will incentivize more ad spend as companies continue to invest in the marketing channels that drive the most results. Artificial intelligence has also strengthened Google Cloud’s core offering. Additionally, the intense bandwidth necessary for AI has also prompted more businesses to use Google Cloud.\n\nArtificial intelligence is still in its early innings. The industry is projected to achieve annualized growth of 19.3% from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. Alphabet is one of the leaders in software for companies looking to capitalize on artificial intelligence, and that should drive accelerating revenue growth from Google Cloud.\n\nGOOGL Valuation Is Better Than Other Cloud Giants\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), three of the largest companies in town, are all heavily focused on cloud computing. Together, these companies have helped pace the stock market in recent years.\n\nIn terms of relative valuation, Alphabet trades at a 23.4 P/E ratio, which is a lower valuation than for MSFT stock or AMZN stock. Microsoft carries a 36.5x P/E ratio, while Amazon’s multiple stands at 46.4x. Google’s relative valuation appeal makes it easier to be bullish on the stock. Alphabet has higher profit margins than Amazon and a higher net income growth rate than Microsoft.\n\nGoogle Cloud also grew faster than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Cloud in the second quarter. While Google Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% year-over-year, Amazon Web Services only registered 19% year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft Cloud fared slightly better with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, but both of those growth rates trail what Alphabet delivered. If Alphabet continues to gain market share in cloud computing, I predict the stock will perform well.\n\nIs Alphabet Stock a Buy?\n\nWall Street analysts currently hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on shares of GOOGL. From the 37 analysts covering the Alphabet stock, 28 offer Buy ratings while 9 have Hold ratings. No Wall Street analysts rate GOOGL stock a Sell. The average price target for GOOGL is $201.44, implying nearly 25% potential upside.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Alphabet Stock\n\nAlphabet has been a leading stock in recent years and has outperformed the S&P 500. While advertising revenue has historically been the driver of GOOGL, Google Cloud is the next captivating growth opportunity. Alphabet’s cloud platform growth is outpacing ad revenue growth and gaining ground on AWS and Microsoft Cloud. I’m bullish on GOOGL stock, especially with an undemanding 23.4 P/E ratio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Debuts Orion AR Glasses as Eventual Smartphone Rival",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. debuted its first pair of augmented reality glasses — devices that show a combined view of the digital and physical worlds, a key step in Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s goal of one day offering a hands-free alternative to the smartphone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Where Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\n\nThe new glasses, introduced Wednesday and called Orion, look like thick, black reading glasses, but have lenses that can display text messages, video calls, and even YouTube videos onto the user’s field of vision. They are prototypes that are not for sale, but will be used internally at Meta for testing and improving the product.\n\nAn accompanying wristband that detects nerve stimulation and cameras built into the frames that track eye movement allow Orion wearers to “click” or “scroll” on the display using just their hands.\n\nThe glasses represent nearly a decade of technological advancement and significant financial investment at Meta. They also offer a glimpse into Zuckerberg’s vision for the future of technology, which has cost the company tens of billions of dollars over the past four years alone.\n\nMeta is already selling Ray-Ban branded smart glasses equipped with cameras and speakers, but Zuckerberg believes that AR glasses will become a kind of mobile, hands-free computer that could one day rival smartphones as the preferred way to communicate and interact online. If smart glasses eventually become mainstream, Meta hopes to be a major player in that new industry, which would also help the company reduce its reliance on competitors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to deliver its products to consumers.\n\nThat goal is still years away despite the Orion prototype, which was debuted at Meta’s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California. The company had hoped to make this version of the device available to the public, but executives said it’s not yet small enough or stylish enough. Those same challenges have plagued similar efforts by other tech companies over the years, including Google and Microsoft Corp.\n\nSnap Inc. unveiled its own pair of AR glasses earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\n\nEventually, Meta executives believe they will be able to make the glasses thin and powerful enough that general consumers will buy them. The goal is to bring Orion to market in the “next few years” for the price of a “high end laptop or smartphone,” said Rahul Prasad, a senior director of product management at Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Any kind of prior attempt at AR has been a headset, goggles, helmets,” he said. “We want to get to glasses.”\n\nFor now, Meta will continue to build and refine the glasses internally until they are ready for public sale. Hundreds of Meta employees have been testing the Orion glasses. The company plans to expand that group considerably now that they’ve been debuted publicly.\n\nUnlike competing products, such as Apple’s Vision Pro headset, Meta’s Orion glasses don’t require a bulky head strap or battery pack to operate. Orion has seven cameras, including two for tracking eye movements, which allow users to control the display using visible hand gestures. Orion works best, though, when paired with an accompanying wristband, which uses electromyography to detect much more subtle hand movements so users can control the glasses with minor finger movements.\n\nMeta designed and produced more than 10 different computer chips embedded in Orion, part of a plan to reduce energy consumption for the glasses but also to decrease the amount of heat generated so that they aren’t warm to the touch. Instead of glass, Orion’s lenses are made of silicon carbide, a material popular in some electric vehicles, which is lighter than glass and also helps bend light at extreme angles, Prasad said.\n\nNew Quest VR Headset\n\nMeta also announced a new, cheaper version of its Quest virtual reality headset, freshening its effort to persuade consumers to spend more time using virtual and augmented reality to play games, watch videos and chat with others.\n\nThe Quest 3S headset has much of the same functionality as the existing Quest 3 device but offers less memory and is several hundred dollars cheaper. The headset will be available in stores beginning Oct. 15 and will cost as little as $300, compared to the $500 Quest 3 devices.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman focus on value, and others like Ken Fisher focus on growth, Asness’ fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\n\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock’s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock’s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock’s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\n\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital’s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\n\nThese returns ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\n\nLooking at the returns for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are plotted over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\n\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund’s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return’s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022 according to Bloomberg,\n\nAQR’s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey’s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund’s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as Citadel Wellington, Point72, and Millennium 5.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\n\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness’ top stock picks, it’s also important to see how his firms’ funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed’s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% – 3.50% by 2025 end.\n\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR’s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index’s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark’s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks “considered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe” has been the way to go so far in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital’s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey’s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 216AQR Funds’ Latest Investment Stake: $504.9 million Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for Google and other businesses. Its primary line of revenue is the Search business, which accounts for 58.6% of the firm’s revenue as of Q2 2024. This means that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains highly dependent on Search, and any troubles for the business could create tailwinds. In 2024, the firm saw some such troubles, after a historic court ruling sided with the DOJ by stating that Search was abusing its market dominance. Additionally, the rise of AI could lead to AI based search that might eat market share away from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, on the AI front, it is one of the strongest firms in the world. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) designs its own tensor processors for AI use and also has access to a foundational model via Bard. These enable to provide AI training capacity to others, such as Apple, and allow businesses to build their AI products through the Google Cloud business. Patient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 7th on our list. While we acknowledge GOOGL's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Breaking down Intel’s wild week",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in its 56-year history. Declining sales, missed opportunities to compete in the AI space, and a massive turnaround effort by CEO Pat Gelsinger looking to return the company to its former glory are putting significant pressure on the chip giant’s bottom line and share price.\n\nAnd things for the company are only getting more interesting.\n\nLast Monday, Intel announced that it signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services, a positive sign for the company’s nascent third-party foundry business.\n\nThen, on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm (QCOM) reached out to Intel about a blockbuster takeover deal that would give Qualcomm a larger foothold in the PC and AI spaces. That’s not all. On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel to keep Gelsinger’s turnaround moving forward. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\nIt’s a lot to follow and even more to make any sense of. Luckily, I’m here to help break it all down for you.\n\nIntel’s slowing sales and AI troubles\n\nIntel is dealing with sliding sales and the unenviable position of having to take on market leader Nvidia in the AI space. For 2023, Intel reported full-year revenue of $54.2 billion, a 14% year-over-year decline from the $63.1 billion the company saw in 2022.\n\nThat included an 8% decline in Intel’s Client Computing Group, which sells chips for PCs; a 20% drop in Data Center and AI revenue; and a 31% decrease in Network and Edge sales. Intel did, however, report a 103% increase in its Intel Foundry Services, but that amounted to just $952 million. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger delivers a speech at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nPart of Intel’s woes have stemmed from the fact that the explosion in PC sales at the onset of the pandemic pulled Client Computing Group revenue forward several quarters, creating a boom and bust. Consumers bought new computers in droves for work and play, sending chip revenue soaring. But millions of consumers don’t usually buy new PCs at the same time. With so many people holding new computers, there were fewer consumers looking for upgrades, and sales entered an extended slump that sent shipments plummeting for eight consecutive quarters.\n\nSales are picking up again, though. In July, IDC said the PC market grew 3% in the second quarter, notching a second consecutive quarter of growth. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\nAt the same time, Intel is facing a new threat from Qualcomm, which began offering its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips in Windows PCs earlier this year as an alternative to Intel’s processors. Those chips provide improved performance and power versus Intel’s older offerings and are meant to compete with Apple’s (AAPL) exceptional M family of chips that power its MacBooks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is fighting back, though. Earlier this month, the company showed off its Core Ultra 200V line of processors that it says can outpace Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nFlagging PC sales also impacted graphics giant Nvidia (NVDA), which saw sales of its video game graphics chips deteriorate after the pandemic boom. But the company, unlike Intel, has managed to exploit its early investments in AI to take advantage of the surge in interest caused by the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThat helped catapult Nvidia to the forefront of the semiconductor industry and sent its stock to extraordinary new heights, rising more than 860% over the last two years and 191% in the last 12 months.\n\nIntel is working to try to catch Nvidia with its own Gaudi line of AI accelerators. On Tuesday, the company debuted its latest Gaudi 3 AI accelerator and announced that IBM will use it as part of its IBM Cloud offering.\n\nBut with Gartner estimating that Nvidia controls more than 70% of AI chip sales, it’s an uphill battle.\n\nIntel’s foundry services\n\nIntel is also battling for position as a chip manufacturer for third-party clients. The plan is for the company’s foundry business to operate as a subsidiary of Intel that builds processors for customers looking for an alternative to TSMC, which is among the world’s largest chipmakers\n\nBut the buildout is costly and Wall Street isn’t completely sold on the idea. Analysts at Citi Research have said Intel should exit the foundry business altogether so that it can improve margins and earnings per share.\n\nIn September, however, Intel announced a multibillion-dollar deal to \"produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced process node.\" The company is also set to build a custom version of its Xeon 6 chip for Amazon.\n\nThe news comes after Intel announced that Microsoft signed on as a manufacturing customer in February. Two big-name companies are certainly a start for Intel, but it’s going to need to sign a slew of customers if it hopes to grow its manufacturing segment to match competing chip fabricators.\n\nQualcomm and Apollo\n\nIntel’s PC and AI woes have left it as a potential takeover target, which is where Qualcomm and Apollo enter the mix. Qualcomm, according to the Wall Street Journal, wants to buy up Intel, though it’s unclear if the company would hold on to all of Intel or sell portions of its business segments. The deal is also sure to generate plenty of antitrust concerns, as the companies are two of the most important chip firms in the US.\n\nApollo, meanwhile, looks to favor Gelsinger’s plans and could invest up to $5 billion in Intel to follow through with the effort, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNow investors will have to wait and see whether Intel moves forward with either company or continues to try to go it alone.

        "content": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off some impressive upgrades to the company's hit Ray-Ban Meta Glasses during the company's Meta Connect event on Wednesday, including the ability to translate live conversations, offer continuous talking features, and recognize the world around you.\n\nThe updates make the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, which start at $299, a far more intelligent piece of technology — and give them similar features to smartphone-based AI apps like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Circle to Search and Gemini and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming improved Siri and visual intelligence.\n\nAccording to Meta, you'll now be able to do things like ask the glasses to remember where you parked. Or, if you want to know about landmarks in a city you're visiting, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses can tell you more about a statue, building, or location when asked. At the grocery store and want to know what to make for dinner? Meta says the glasses can suggest what you should make based on what you're looking at while walking the aisles. Meta is updating its Ray-Ban Meta Glasses with new AI capabilities. (Meta) (Meta)\n\nThe company also says it's adding real-time translation to the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses. Zuckerberg showed off the feature during a live demo. And while there was a small delay between when a person stopped talking and the glasses began translating, it certainly appeared to work well. In fact, live-translating a conversation with the glasses looks far more natural than doing the same thing while holding up a smartphone.\n\nFinally, Meta showed off a new limited-edition transparent design for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses that lets you see the device's internal components. It gives the glasses a late-90s/early-2000s look that more tech companies should adopt. (Says the guy who grew up during that time.)\n\nIn addition to updates for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, the company also announced its first AI vision models. The new open-source models, called Llama 3.2 11B and 90B, are designed to be able to understand images like charts and graphs.\n\nThe idea is to give developers the ability to create apps using the new models that can, for example, provide a hiker with information about when a particular hike gets steeper by having the AI read over a map of the route.\n\nMeta's AI work has quickly made it one of the top open-source AI companies around. And if it can keep on innovating, it could stand among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "An AI 'genius' founded a startup that imitates celebrity voices. Google just paid him $2.7 billion",
        "content": "Google (GOOGL) has reportedly paid $2.7 billion to acquire a chatbot that allows you to talk to AI versions of celebrities. The whopping sum, however, also brings in the company’s top employees — including a former Googler.\n\nNoam Shazeer left Google in 2021 after the tech giant declined to release the chatbot he had developed. Now, he will help lead its AI initiative Gemini.\n\nInsiders at Google told the Wall Street Journal that while Google officially paid around nearly three billion dollars for the company, Character.AI, its reunion with Shazeer and his top brass was the greatest contributing factor to the final price tag.\n\nAs of August, Character.AI had raised about $150 million and its last known valuation was around $1 billion.\n\n“I am so proud of everything we built at Character.AI over the last 3 years,” Shazeer wrote in a statement to TechCrunch. “I am confident that the funds from the non-exclusive Google licensing agreement, together with the incredible Character.AI team, positions Character.AI for continued success in the future.”\n\nThe chatbot founded in 2022 allows you to talk to AI versions of famous people such as Elon Musk, as well as fictional personalities. Users can choose various roles and tones and even get practical advice.\n\nThe platform has largely attracted users aged 18 to 24, who make up 56% of the website traffic, according to SimilarWeb (SMWB), a data intelligence platform. Early versions included language tutors and coding instructors, followed by a subscription-based model for faster response times and more pre-trained models.\n\nThe platform, however, quickly became an outlet for romantic role-play. According to Time, many of the 18 million characters created on Character.AI are a mix of “absurdist, racy, or explicitly sexual.”\n\nDespite the potential pitfalls of chatbots, Google executives have plans to spend $12 billion every quarter this year to stay ahead of the AI curve.\n\nMuch of that spending is on startups founded by former Google employees — like Shazeer’s — a process known as a ‘reverse acqui-hire.’ The process allows big companies to license the technology of smaller companies and hire some of their staff, without going through a full acquisition.\n\nIn March, Microsoft (MSFT) paid $650 million in cash to strike a deal with Inflection, an OpenAI rival, that gave it access to the startup’s models and most of its employees. That deal has since come under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTech expert Scott Galloway said on his and tech journalist Kara Swisher’s podcast Pivot in June that Microsoft took took the “heart and lungs” of the company. Swisher added: “There’s gonna be lawsuits in the AI area… And there should be.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google Challenges Microsoft's Cloud Dominance, Files Antitrust Complaint in Europe: Report\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) with the European Union’s top antitrust regulator Tuesday for allegedly abusing its influence to lock customers into Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure.\n\nGoogle Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery said that Microsoft customers had to pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators.\n\nFor nearly twenty years, Google became a target of EU antitrust action, partly stemming from complaints supported by Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nGoogle has long trailed Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services in the cloud business.\n\nGoogle’s complaint comes after Microsoft’s settlement of a complaint from a trade group representing European cloud services providers.\n\nGoogle argues that Windows Server customers are unfairly penalized if they want to use competing cloud services.\n\nGoogle has also made similar arguments to those of the U.K.’s competition regulator.\n\nEarlier this week, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria noted Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud are gaining traction in cloud and code generation businesses at the cost of Microsoft Azure.\n\nBig Tech companies have been drawing global regulatory scrutiny for their alleged anticompetitive practices, which have boosted their toplines and bottomlines. The companies allegedly created “walled gardens” under their products and services, preventing users from resorting to rival services.\n\nGoogle drew flak for paying companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to keep its search engine as the default for its devices. Apple also drew scrutiny for preventing users from using rival operating systems for its devices.\n\nReports claimed Amazon’s alleged antitrust practices of preferential treatment to its products on its platforms could lead to the company’s breakup. Google also faced similar concerns. However, Wedbush’s Dan Ives snubbed worries over the breakup of Big Techs for alleged violation of antitrust norms.\n\nPrice Actions: MSFT stock is up 0.55% at $431.54 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Which Big Tech Giant Offers The Best Stock Opportunity – AAPL, GOOGL, or MSFT?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are well-known among the big tech giants that have leading roles across various technology sectors beyond semiconductors. I wanted to perform a comparison of these 3 stocks, and I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to assist me in evaluating which of these titans offers the best stock opportunity right now. While I view all three companies as long-term winners and maintain a bullish outlook on each, I believe that Alphabet is currently best positioned for the most significant upside, making it the top stock at this time.\n\nCore Business Overviews for these Three Tech Titans\n\nWhile I maintain a bullish stance on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft for the long term, it’s essential to establish the core differences in their businesses. First, Apple’s strength lies in its hardware, including the iPhone, Mac, and wearables; products which account for over 70% of revenue and reinforce its brand power. Moreover, Apple’s growing services segment (comprising the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay) now contributes nearly 30% of revenue, adding to its ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, Alphabet, the leader in digital advertising, generates the majority of its revenue through Google Search and YouTube, commanding a dominant share of the global search engine market. Furthermore, the company is adding to its investments in cloud computing via Google Cloud, which is growing rapidly but still trails behind industry leaders Azure (Microsoft) and AWS.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft excels in enterprise and cloud computing. Azure is the second-largest cloud platform globally, driving substantial growth for MSFT. Additionally, Microsoft’s software suite, including Windows and Microsoft 365, maintains a strong foothold in the productivity and enterprise space, solidifying the company’s market position.\n\nComparison of Valuation Metrics\n\nDespite trading at premium valuation multiples relative to their industry averages, my positive outlooks on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft remain supported by strong business fundamentals.\n\nApple stock trades at a forward P/E of 33.8x, roughly 40% higher than the technology hardware industry average and 23% above its five-year historical average. Alphabet stock, meanwhile, trades at a forward P/E of 21.2x, almost 60% above the interactive media industry average but about 17% below its GOOGL stock’s own historical average. Microsoft stock trades at a forward P/E of 32.9x, approximately 36% above the system software industry average and just 4.7% above its historical average.\n\nHowever, when factoring in long-term EPS growth estimates over the next 3-5 years, the picture changes. On the basis of PEG (Price to Earnings to Growth ratio), Apple trades at a stretched forward PEG ratio of 3.9x, while Alphabet and Microsoft are more attractively valued with forward PEG ratios of 1.3x and 2.5x, respectively.\n\nAlthough Alphabet has the most de-risked valuation, one could argue that Apple and Microsoft’s diversified business models—dominating hardware, software, and subscription services—offer more stable, recurring revenue despite more limited growth prospects. AAPL stock and MSFT stock are supported by broad revenue bases that reduce reliance on a single income stream. GOOGL stock, meanwhile, carries a heavy dependence on cyclical advertising. That difference may justify Alphabet’s discounted valuation relative to Apple and Microsoft.\n\nCapital Return Programs\n\nAll three companies (Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft) are strong investment holdings due to their robust capital return programs. While their dividend yields of below 1% are modest at best, these companies reward shareholders through substantial share buyback programs.\n\nApple recently authorized a record-breaking $110 billion stock buyback; the largest in corporate history. Over the past twelve months, Apple has repurchased approximately $96.34 billion in common shares, translating to a buyback yield of 2.68% based on a $3.48 trillion market capitalization. Similarly, Alphabet, after announcing its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share this year, unveiled a $70 billion share repurchase program. Over the past twelve months, Alphabet has repurchased $63.3 billion worth of shares, resulting in a buyback yield of 3.2% on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nMicrosoft’s share buyback efforts are a little less competitive, with a newly authorized $60 billion share repurchase program. Over the past twelve months, Microsoft repurchased $17.2 billion in shares, translating to a buyback yield of 0.5% based on its recent $3.21 trillion market capitalization.\n\nAI and Cloud Potential\n\nAs one of the most significant topics in the tech world, the way Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft have approached AI is a key pillar of my bullish outlook for their stocks.\n\nAlphabet has embedded AI and machine learning across its products, from Google Search to YouTube, and is well-positioned to drive growth through Google Cloud. Analysts project 11% revenue growth for Alphabet over the next two fiscal years. Microsoft, meanwhile, has solidified its AI leadership through its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, as well as through Azure’s AI services. Competing closely with AWS for cloud dominance, Microsoft is forecast to grow revenue by 14.6% over two years.\n\nApple’s AI presence is a bit more limited. While the company is rumored to be working on advanced AI projects, possibly integrating AI deeper into Siri and its ecosystem, its AI efforts remain less prominent compared to peers. This may explain Apple’s more modest revenue growth forecast, with analysts predicting only a 2.1% top-line increase over the next two fiscal years.\n\nWall Street Consensus\n\nMy bullish views on Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft align with the majority of Wall Street analysts. Apple, for example, has a consensus Moderate Buy rating based on 33 analysts, with 23 rating it a Buy, nine a Hold, and only one a Sell. The average AAPL price target of $248.89 suggests about 10% potential upside.\n\nAlphabet is viewed even more favorably, carrying a Strong Buy rating from 36 analysts, 27 of whom recommend a Buy, while nine recommend a Hold. Its average price target of $201.94 implies a ~25% potential upside.\n\nMicrosoft also has a Strong Buy rating according to the consensus, with 28 of 30 analysts rating it a Buy, and the remaining two rating it a Hold. The average price target of $501.15 points to more than 15% potential upside.\n\nIn Conclusion, Alphabet Looks Like The Best Name\n\nIn conclusion, while Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all strong long-term investments with dominant positions in their respective sectors, if I had to favor one investment right now it would be GOOGL stock. Alphabet’s strong growth, robust capital returns, and more attractive relative valuation give it a slight edge at this juncture.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Google escalated a feud with Microsoft over cloud computing on Wednesday with a European Union antitrust complaint accusing its tech rival of anticompetitive practices.\n\nIn a blog post, Google alleged that Microsoft's licensing practices lock business customers into using its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nIt said Microsoft is the only cloud provider that uses such tactics, which stifles competition, costs businesses more and exposes them to bigger security risks.\n\nGoogle, which competes against Microsoft with its Google Cloud services, said it filed a formal complaint with the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer.\n\nMicrosoft said that it already amicably settled similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, “even after Google hoped they would keep litigating.”\n\nThose providers, part of the trade group Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe, said in July that they withdrew their own complaint after signing a deal with Microsoft.\n\n\"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission,” Microsoft said in a prepared statement.\n\nA commission spokesperson said it has received the complaint and will assess it “under our standard procedures.”\n\nGoogle said Microsoft changed its licensing terms in 2019 to impose “extreme financial penalties” on businesses that want to use Windows Server software on rival services like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. That's despite there being no technical barriers to switch services.\n\nLocking in users to a single technology platform brings heightened security risks, Google said, pointing to a global tech outage in July stemming from a faulty software update by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike that grounded flights and knocked banks and hospital systems offline.\n\nView comments",

Character.AI’s general counsel, Dominic Perella, will temporarily step in as interim CEO of Character.AI.\n\nTo regain Shazeer’s talent, Google reportedly paid around $2.7 billion to license Character.AI’s technology and bring Shazeer back to lead its AI efforts. Google acquired stakes from Character investors and employees, with Shazeer receiving a substantial payout, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nCharacter.AI, despite boasting over 20 million monthly active users, the startup faced challenges monetizing its services and controlling user behavior.\n\nAccording to reports, Shazeer is now one of three leaders steering Google’s development of its latest AI project, Gemini.\n\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin expects Google’s proprietary large language models (LLMs) to drive significant upside over the next 3-5 years. The analyst hailed  Google and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the most likely beneficiaries of the current arms race to build GenAI tools and capabilities.\n\nGOOGL stock has risen 24% in the last 12 months as it integrates AI technology into its Search and other businesses.\n\nPrice Action: GOOGL stock is up 0.27% at $162.73 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nApple iPhone To Fuel 96% Of 2025 Revenue, Analyst Says: A Safer Bet Than AI-Heavy Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta?\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\n\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\n\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless. The companies discussed in the news are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of the firm, recently spoke at the UN Summit of the Future, where he announced that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) would create a $120 million Global AI Opportunity Fund through which it will make AI education and training available in communities around the world in partnership with local nonprofits and NGOs. Pichai also touched on other AI themes during his speech, describing AI as the most transformative technology yet and noting that it presented four broad opportunities. These included helping people access information in their own language, accelerating scientific discovery, providing alerts and tracking around climate disasters, and fueling economic progress.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of AI news you probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "By Philip Blenkinsop\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google filed a complaint to the European Commission on Wednesday against what it said were Microsoft's anti-competitive practices to lock customers into Microsoft's cloud platform Azure.\n\nGoogle, whose biggest cloud computing rivals are Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, said Microsoft was exploiting its dominant Windows Server operating system to prevent competition.\n\nGoogle Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery told a briefing that Microsoft made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators. This did not apply if they used Azure. Users of rival cloud systems would also get later and more limited security updates, Zavery said.\n\nGoogle pointed to a 2023 study by cloud services organisation CISPE which found that European businesses and public sector bodies were paying up to 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) per year on Microsoft licensing penalties.\n\nMicrosoft in July clinched a 20-million-euro deal to settle an antitrust complaint about its cloud computing licensing practices with CISPE, averting an EU investigation. However, the settlement did not include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and AliCloud, prompting criticism from the first two companies.\n\nGoogle said Microsoft had locked customers into using collaboration application Teams even when they preferred alternatives and was using the same playbook for Azure.\n\n\"The time to act is now,\" Zavery said. \"The cloud market will get more and more restrictive if things don't happen now.\"\n\nGoogle said that only regulatory action would end Microsoft's \"vendor lock\" and level the playing field for competitors.\n\n\"We are asking the European Commission to act now. We're asking them to really look at this issue, help customers decide and keep the choices going for them,\" Zavery said.\n\nGoogle said Microsoft's Windows Server and various Microsoft products had a market share of over 70% in European businesses.\n\nFor years, Microsoft allowed its products to work on any hardware, such as laptops, but placed restrictions in 2019 as it entered the cloud business.\n\nThe cloud computing business is growing at around per year 20% in the EU, with plenty of potential. A McKinsey study in April showed that two-thirds of EU companies had less that half of their workloads on the cloud.\n\n($1 = 0.8943 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google CEO Says Antitrust Trials Could Drag On for Many Years",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said it will take many years to resolve Google’s antitrust battles, downplaying the idea that they pose an immediate threat to the company’s business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes Waiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development Exclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad NY’s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\n\n“It’s going to take time for it to play out,” Pichai said in an interview for an upcoming episode of The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations. “Where we think it really harms our ability to innovate on behalf of our users, we are going to be vigorous in defending ourselves.”\n\nGoogle is embroiled in two separate antitrust trials brought by the US Justice Department, which alleges the tech leader illegally dominates the digital advertising market and online search. The ads trial kicked off in court this month. In the search case, which Google lost, Judge Amit Mehta said he aims to iron out the final issues by August.\n\n“We definitely disagree with the ruling, but it’s still in the middle of the remedies phase,” Pichai told Rubenstein, referring to the part of the legal process where a court determines the solution to Google’s market dominance. “And you know, we will appeal and this process will likely take many years.”\n\nThe government’s timeline for legal action contrasts with particularly fast-paced changes in the technology industry, which the Justice Department is considering as part of its analysis. Already, Google is working quickly to develop a strong position in artificial intelligence. By the time both of the current cases conclude, the industry will have evolved dramatically.\n\nIt could be months before Judge Leonie Brinkema makes a decision on the ads case, which alleges Google violated antitrust law by building a monopoly over web advertising technology. If the government wins, it aims to break up the company and force it to sell some of its assets. Google would likely appeal that decision, arguing that it has competed fairly against rivals like Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nTo explain how long appeals can take, Pichai pointed to Google’s victory against a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine in the European Union General Court last week — more than four years after it was levied.\n\nFor the full interview with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, watch “The David Rubenstein Show: Peer to Peer Conversations” on Wednesday October 9 on Bloomberg Television at 9 pm New York time.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Activision and Blizzard’s Corporate Warcraft This Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\n“Now is the Time to Revisit Portfolios”\n\nThe Fed went through with a 50 basis point cut and as things have started to get clear, investors must give their portfolio another look. On September 20, Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management’s chief equities portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss why and how investors must revisit their portfolios.\n\nHe suggested that now is the perfect time for investors to sit down and reassess their investments with the help of advisors. Stucky highlights that there is currently $6.3 trillion sitting in money market funds in the asset class, which may not be as attractive after the 50 basis point cut went through. He urged investors to consider a rather diversified portfolio and suggested that sitting on cash alone is risky.\n\nHe reiterated that while investors do not need to alter their long-term strategic goals, the ones with idle cash must try to allocate or deploy that money in other investment classes. According to Stucky, garnering a solid yield or return on investment does not come without risk and investors must understand that with the current Fed decision on board, it is impossible to get that kind of yield from cash alone.\n\nWhat Does the Cut Signal?\n\nOn September 19, Dennis Lockhart, Former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the aftermath of the rate cut. According to Lockhart, the rate cut was perfectly balanced and rather optimistic in nature.\n\nHe believes that the Fed’s decision was not reactionary to anything going on in the market or the economy. The Fed is particularly confident about the inflation rate, the labor market, and the soft landing of the economy.\n\nLockhart suggested that the Fed will reroute and remain flexible based on how the economy is performing from meeting to meeting. According to him, the Fed will aim to maintain flexibility and the 50 basis point cut was more like a compensation to what should have happened in July.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 13 most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts we examined multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to come up with the best blue chip stocks. We then chose stocks with a forward P/E ratio that was less than the S&P 500’s (22.68, as of September 22). Finally, we ranked the shortlisted stocks in ascending order of the analyst upside potential, as of September 22, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nForward P/E, as of September 22: 21.4\n\nAnalyst Upside Potential, as of September 22: 25%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\n\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Moreover, the latest version of Gemini has accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\n\nWhile Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 25% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Salesforce's Free Cash Flow Could Double by 2029 Amid AI Push, Analyst Says While Upgrading Stock\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin upgraded Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $268 to $325.\n\nThe re-rating reflects a favorable risk-reward given the potential for free cash flow per share to double to $20+ by fiscal 2029 (calendar 2028) from $9.65 in fiscal 2024 (calendar 2023), even if top-line growth remains at subdued levels of 8%-9%.\n\nBracelin flagged that Salesforce also has the lowest valuation multiple relative to large-cap software peers on an Enterprise Value-to-Sales, Enterprise Value-to-Free Cash Flow, and Price-to-Earnings basis.\n\nAlso Read: NVIDIA, Salesforce Announce Strategic AI Collaboration: What To Know\n\nDiscussions last week with the leadership team, partners, and customers gave the analyst confidence that new pricing and packaging could broaden multi-cloud adoption.\n\nThe promise of Agentforce powered by the Atlas Reasoning Engine paired with Data Cloud could help stabilize demand and drive a recovery entering calendar 2026 (fiscal 2027).\n\nBracelin raised estimates using a target EV/FCF of 23x (versus 22x prior) and a 14% discount rate (16% prior).\n\nBracelin noted that the combination of free multi-cloud options via the new Foundations suite for existing Sales or Service cloud customers and the 52% ARPU uplift to Einstein 1 versus Unlimited could be crucial in sparking a growth recovery from calendar 2025 (fiscal 2026) to calendar 2026 (fiscal 2027).\n\nThe analyst flagged that Salesforce has historically provided new platform updates three times per year. However, the pace of AI has changed this cadence, most notably within Data Cloud, where new platform updates are released monthly.\n\nSalesforce chief Marc Benioff and team are operating in “founder mode” with the accelerated pace of internal product execution, supported by veteran boomerangs and new management add that bring strong backgrounds from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and more Bracelin highlighted.\n\nYears of manual Trailblazer developer work building Flows and Apex Actions have turned into a strategic advantage, according to the analyst. He added that these can be repurposed to provide critical guard rails to power agents via the Atlas Reasoning Engine paired with Data Cloud.\n\nFurther margin leverage and buybacks could sustain low double-digit free cash flow growth per share for the next 3-5 years. CRM shares could benefit from earnings and multiple expansions, as per Bracelin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBracelin projects third-quarter revenue of $9.34 billion and EPS of $2.43.\n\nPrice Action: CRM stock is up 1.35% at $267.67 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSalesforce Unveils New Agentforce Partner Network, Partners With Google Cloud\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Wedbush Maintains Outperform Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Raymond James Maintains Strong Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Google (GOOGL) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced Tuesday they are partnering to introduce artificial intelligence-generated closed captioning.\n\nCaption AI, as it’s known internally, will only be available in the U.S. for unscripted programming, such as news, sports, or reality TV. It will use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform — an AI development platform for building and using generative AI, which offers access to Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\n“Captioning has traditionally been a labor-intensive and time-consuming process,” the companies said in a statement. “To maintain high levels of accuracy, Warner Bros Discovery’s captioning solution incorporates a workflow that utilizes Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform to optimize captioning, coupled with human-oversight for quality assurance.”\n\nChannels and platforms under Warner Bros. Discovery include CNN, Max, the Discovery Channel, and Discovery+.\n\nThe companies said the new tech will reduce file creation time up to 80% compared with manual captioning, and will cut captioning costs by up to 50%.\n\n“AI has the potential to transform a variety of processes across the media and entertainment industry that deliver real business impact,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. “With its captioning solution, Warner Bros. Discovery is seeing an incredible example of how AI agents can save organizations time and money.”\n\nGiven just how new AI is, human transcribers will still need to check the AI-generated captions for accuracy. But given that vendors can charge around $15 per minute, or more, for transcribing services, the new tech would reduce platforms’ reliance on transcribers.\n\n“Providing viewers with high-quality captions is incredibly important to Warner Bros. Discovery,” said Avi Saxena, chief technology officer of Warner Bros. Discovery’s direct-to-consumer business. “Working with Google Cloud to utilize Vertex AI within Warner Bros. Discovery’s caption AI workflow has not only helped to accelerate our captioning process, but also has improved our efficiency and speed, while reducing costs.”\n\nGenerative AI became a flashpoint during last year’s writers and actors strikes — one of the biggest labor actions in Hollywood’s history. Both those who work behind and in front of the camera argued AI has the potential to undermine their roles — and cut jobs — if not properly regulated.\n\nIn that battle against the rise of AI, writers and actors won significant protections. Under the newly negotiated contracts, studios can’t use AI to write or edit already written scripts, or use AI-generated content as source material. They also can’t use AI-generated versions of an actor’s likeness without their explicit consent.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Carrier Global (CARR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.83 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 24, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.83 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.81 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Carrier Global has an Earnings ESP of 1.9%.\n\nCARR is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Alphabet (GOOGL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on October 22, 2024, Alphabet holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.84 a share 28 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nFor Alphabet, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 is 0.27%.\n\nCARR and GOOGL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "Will Weakness in Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 12%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Alphabet's  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n29% = US$88b ÷ US$301b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.29 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Alphabet's Earnings Growth And 29% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.1% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is GOOGL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GOOGL is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Alphabet Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nAlphabet has a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 97% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\n\nLooking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.7% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "content": "By Kenrick Cai\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - Alphabet’s Google is providing key capabilities for an artificial intelligence assistant for Volkswagen drivers in a smartphone app, part of Google's strategy to win business by offering tools to build enterprise AI applications.\n\nConsumers can ask Volkswagen's in-app assistant questions like “How do I change a flat tire?” or point their phone cameras at vehicle dashboards to receive relevant information.\n\nThe AI assistant draws on Google's Gemini large language models, programs that can understand and generate predictive responses to human language, and cloud computing capacity.\n\nThe VW tool was designed by adding data such as Volkswagen owner’s manuals and YouTube videos on vehicle maintenance to Gemini.\n\nGoogle Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian told Reuters that the product required overcoming technical hurdles to multimodality, the ability to process different data types such as text, images and videos.\n\n\"The problem looks superficially simple, but it’s technically very complex,” Kurian said. “Most people think what we built is a speech-to-text translation system that then looks up a manual. Absolutely not.”\n\nThe AI assistant is free and available to about 120,000 owners of Volkswagen’s Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport models. It will roll out by early next year to other cars from model year 2020 and later.\n\nCorporate adoption of generative AI could alter the lucrative cloud computing market, where Google places third in terms of market share behind Amazon and Microsoft. Most companies are still searching for applications that users will find practical.\n\nCloud computing is a growing business segment for Google, accounting for $33 billion of the firm's $307 billion in overall revenue in 2023.\n\nAI solutions have driven billions in revenue this year, the company has said, though it declined to disclose more precise figures.\n\nVolkswagen declined to give details about usage for its AI assistant so far.\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Why Are Street Analysts Bullish On This Wide Moat Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other wide moat stocks.\n\nUndoubtedly, global and domestic investors have mastered the art of riding out the highs and lows of the US stock market. They tend to believe that fluctuations in the stock market are short-term, and should be dealt with accordingly.\n\nMcKinsey & Company highlighted that, in 2001, the market cap of the companies making up the S&P 500 stood at ~$10 trillion. As of mid-June 2022 (despite the bearish opening), S&P 500 market capitalization touched ~$32 trillion. Also, the mean total yearly returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 between 1996 to mid-June 2022 was ~9% in nominal terms, or ~6.8% in real terms.\n\nThe investors have seen significant fluctuations. S&P 500 saw a strong decline in 2000, 2001, and 2002, with a ~37% decline in 2008 and a ~22% fall in 1H 2022. That being said, between 1996 and mid-June 2022, S&P 500 returns only declined 5 times annually. While there can be significant fluctuations in the US markets, the macroeconomic indicators can help provide a broader overview of the expected performance of equities.\n\nUS Fed Rate Cut – It Finally Happened\n\nThe decision on the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve was indeed a closely watched one. The apex bank decided to go for a larger 50-bps reduction in interest rates, instead of a more traditional 25-bps rate cut. This decision was more consequential than normal for 2 reasons. Firstly, this rate cut marked the initiation of a long-awaited easing cycle. Therefore, the US Federal Reserve shifted its focus away from the risks related to inflation and towards protecting the labor market and economic expansion.\n\nSecondly, the rate cut decision itself was much more critical and engaging than normal. History suggests that the US Fed provides greater transparency when it comes to decision-making. This means the financial markets are not surprised by the decision as people know what the US Fed is going to do. However, the recent one was not like this, with markets pricing the 25-bps rate cut decision. The move to cut the key rates by 50 basis points should help the US Fed normalize rates more quickly and be ahead of the emergent slowness in the broader labor market. That being said, the US Fed's forecasts (the dots) don't reflect this pace continuing beyond September.\n\nThe recent report by Russell Investments highlighted that the company expects the US Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at each of the remaining meetings in 2024. Furthermore, this pace should be sustained into 2025. If the trajectory continues, the US Fed will be down to the company’s expectations of the normal or equilibrium rate of interest of between 3%-3.25% by this time of the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquity Market Outlook Post Rate Cut\n\nThe implications for the rate cut onto equities hang mainly on the fundamental backdrop—i.e., corporate earnings and whether the US economy is heading for a soft or hard landing. In case of a soft landing, Russell Investments believes that the combination of lower rates and resilient fundamentals should benefit select areas of the market such as real estate and small caps. Regarding small caps, in particular, the investment firm expects a ripe environment for skilled active managers to pick quality businesses at more attractive valuations.\n\nIn the remainder of 2024 and 2025, the US Fed cuts are expected to have a positive effect on the economy and markets. Analysts at Wells Fargo believe that the global economy should also benefit, as major central banks around the world have already announced the cut rates or will be announcing soon.\n\nMarket experts believe that the Fed rate cut expectations have led to the investors rejigging their portfolios and pivoting towards public companies that are interest-rate sensitive. These include dividend companies, telecommunication giants, utilities, and REITs, among others.\n\nWall Street also believes that the rate cuts should help well-established and financially stable companies to increase their spending and investments, which are likely to reflect in their stock prices in the remainder of 2024 and early 2025.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list the 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted an extensive online search and sifted through online rankings and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF. Next, we considered average analysts’ price targets of the selected stocks. Finally, we ranked the stocks according to their potential upside, as of September 21. We also included the hedge fund sentiment around these stocks, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAnalysts’ Average Price Target: 25.31%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates as a holding company. The company offers web-based searches, advertisements, maps, software applications, and other related services.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to enjoy wide economic moat as a result of significant intangible assets associated with the overall technological expertise in search algorithms and AI (ML and deep learning), together with access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers. As a result of these competitive advantages, the company’s network effect has been becoming stronger. With an increasing number of online users and usage, digital ad spending is bound to increase, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be the primary beneficiary. In 2Q 2024, the company’s advertising revenue, which is a significant part of its business, came in at $64.62 billion as compared to an estimate of $64.53 billion.\n\nAlso, Android’s huge global market share of smartphones places the company well to continue dominating the mobile search. Wall Street experts believe that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been validating its position as a leading AI beneficiary, given the encouraging signs on both consumer adoption of AI Search features and enterprise demand for AI agents and other services in the Cloud.\n\nIn 2Q 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)  saw its revenues coming at $84.74 billion, surpassing the analysts’ expectations of $84.16 billion. The company’s 2Q 2024 results were aided by strong performance in Google's Search and Cloud services. The management highlighted the importance of investment in high-growth opportunities and its focus on re-engineering the cost base.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter, 216 hedge funds held stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). BMO Capital Markets reaffirmed an “Outperform” rating on the company’s shares, setting a price target of $222.00 on 16th September.\n\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of the best wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To George Soros. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\n\nThe Man Who Broke the Bank of England\n\nGeorge Soros, the owner of Soros Fund Management, is known as one of the most controversial investors in the history of investing. The now 94-year-old, “broke the Bank of England” after he reportedly made $1 billion from shorting the British pound in 1992. As of September 19, Soros has a net worth of $7.2 billion. He managed client money in New York from 1969 to 2011.\n\nSoros Fund Management was founded in 1970 and manages almost $28 billion in net assets at the moment. The fund is the principal asset manager for Soros’ philanthropic venture, the Open Society Foundations (OSF). So far he has given away more than $32 billion of his fortune to the OSF. Last year, Soros handed over the fund to his eldest son, Alexander Soros, who now aims to take his philanthropic endeavors to another level.\n\nGeorge Soros’ Investment Philosophy\n\nSoros is known for being ahead of the market. Historically, he has made financial decisions after gauging market feedback and predicting market activities, that have returned or saved him millions, if not billions. This is what he calls the “reflexivity” theory. By applying this theory to finance and investments, Soros values assets based on market feedback, predicts market bubbles, and exploits market opportunities. A recent example of this was when Soros pulled out a staggering $73 million from two major technology players right before the tech downturn in mid-July.\n\nSoros also uses another method, which he calls the Soros’ Method, to forecast events in the financial markets using current data. He then tests his theories on small investments and if the theory seems to be working out, he expands his position or size of his investment. This, however, does not mean that Soros has never failed or encountered risk during his time as an investor. He has made multiple expensive decisions from which he learned lessons and has even quoted them in his books. Here is an excerpt of what he said in his book, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\n“The prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. … I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOne can say that Soros’ degree in philosophy helped him carve his way into the financial markets. Now that we have studied Soros’ investment philosophy, let’s take a look at the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros, we examined his 13F portfolio and selected his top 10 growth stock picks, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Why You Should Buy Alphabet Stock\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nSoros Fund Management Stake Value: $166.02 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Soros. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo. The technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\n\nGoogle DeepMind, the company’s research lab is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, and launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Moreover, the latest version of Gemini has accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\n\nWhile Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. Moreover, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\n\nOverall, the company’s new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) expects to log $100 billion in revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In addition to that, in the second quarter, cloud revenue increased by 28.8% and overall revenue increased by 13.59%.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) received a rare Wall Street downgrade on Monday over concerns the tech giant's AI lead is diminishing while it has become too reliant on Nvidia (NVDA) for its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, keeping their price target unchanged at $475, still implying around an 8% upside from current levels.\n\nThe firm noted that Microsoft's early investments and commercial product rollouts initially gave the company an advantage over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG), who it said were both \"caught flat-footed.\"\n\nSince then, Amazon and Google \"have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think you can start telling that they've caught up,\" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance on Monday (video above).\n\n\"Going forward, we think AWS [Amazon Web Services] and GCP [Google Cloud Platform] actually have an advantage over [Microsoft] Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU — something Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.\"\n\nCiting their own hyperscaler semiconductor data, the analysts at D.A Davidson said Microsoft is \"beholden\" to Nvidia, its supplier of AI chips.\n\n\"Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders,\" Luria said.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley recently reported, Microsoft has embarked on broad push to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.\n\nThe company has been plowing cash into building out its AI data centers, with its latest quarterly capital expenditures topping out at $19 billion, up 35% from the prior quarter.\n\nMicrosoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its cloud Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.\n\nDespite Monday's downgrade, Microsoft shares were trading mostly flat. The stock, which topped in July, is up roughly 15% year-to-date.

        "title": "Tesla stock pops amid bullish sales forecast as robotaxi unveiling looms",
        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise as investors await the company’s long-anticipated robotaxi debut and its third-quarter sales figures.\n\nShares of the Elon Musk-helmed EV company jumped over 4% on Monday. Tesla is set to finally unveil its driverless cabs on Oct. 10 after months of delays. Also in early October, the company will announce its deliveries for the third quarter. Wall Street analysts forecast sales to rise 6% from last year to about 460,000 EVs.\n\nBarclays analyst Daniel Levy said in a bullish note to investors on Monday that he expects Tesla deliveries to jump higher than that consensus estimate. Levy forecasts Tesla will deliver about 470,000 EVs, which would represent 8% jump from last year. He pointed to an uptick in sales in China, despite far underperforming domestic rival BYD (1211.HK).\n\n“Given the positive data points reported thus far in the quarter, particularly in China, we believe Tesla's sales trajectory is well understood and investors are expecting a stronger result,” Levy wrote.\n\nTesla has faced a number of high-profile issues over the past year — from major safety concerns and mass recalls to factory shutdowns, layoffs, and heightened competition in China. Three senior Tesla executives resigned this spring. But after a dismal first quarter earnings report, Tesla fared better-than-expected in the following period thanks to price cuts. Second-quarter deliveries totaled nearly 440,000, easily topping analysts’ expectations.\n\nThe company's stock has completed a second significant 2024 turnaround. Its gains Monday put it relatively flat for the year. Levy said “Robotaxi Day” will likely add to that upward trajectory.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTesla is betting on succeeding in a market where others have faced hurdles. Like his takes on space travel and brain chips, Musk’s promise of a world filled with driverless cars seems far off. Other attempts to introduce autonomous taxis into city traffic have been chaotic — even disastrous.\n\nAlphabet-owned (GOOG) Waymo was investigated by the federal government after crashes and traffic violations this spring, and in June, the company recalled its fleet of nearly 700 driverless cars. Waymo is back at it, though, and recently announced an expanded partnership with Uber that will bring its cabs to more cities.\n\nIts rival, General Motors-owned (GM) Cruise will also take to the road again after suspending operations last year when a driverless cab hit a pedestrian and dragged her 20 feet — this time with human drivers.\n\n“Most people still have no idea how crushingly good Tesla FSD will get,” Musk said in a post on X in late March, referring to Tesla’s “Full Self-Drive” mode. “It will be superhuman to such a degree that it will seem strange in the future that humans drove cars, even while exhausted and drunk!”\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter repeatedly pushing back Tesla’s Robotaxi day, Oct. 10 could showcase whether Tesla is up to the task of shifting public opinion toward the kind of future envisioned by Musk.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft's AI Lead Shrinks: Analyst Downgrades Stock As Amazon And Google Close The Gap\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded the rating on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Neutral from Buy while maintaining a price target of $475.\n\nLuria noted competition has essentially caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation.\n\nThe analyst now ranked Microsoft fourth within the Magnificient Six. The stock increased 92% since his January 2023 initiation, compared to 49% for the S&P500.\n\nLuria noted that Microsoft has accelerated growth and extended margins over the last few quarters as the first to embrace and commercialize generative AI. Through an early investment in OpenAI and the ability to quickly deploy capabilities within Azure and GitHub, it took a significant lead over Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which translated to superior results over the prior 4-6 quarters.\n\nThe analyst noted that Microsoft’s lead is now diminished in both the cloud and code generation businesses, making it difficult for Microsoft to continue to outperform.\n\nLuria said AWS is already adding nearly as much cloud business as Azure after a few quarters of Microsoft adding more business. Google Cloud Platform’s expansion has also seen its business accelerate to comparable growth rates as Azure prior quarter.\n\nThe analyst’s new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in deploying their silicon into their data centers, giving them a significant advantage over Azure in the future.\n\nWhile Microsoft has discussed its Maia chips, it is years behind Amazon and Google and seems to be using them only to run Azure OpenAI Services workloads, he flagged. Luria noted this means Microsoft has been escalating an arms race it may not be able to prevail. He said this makes Microsoft beholden to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which means it will continue to shift wealth from its shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.\n\nAfter significant margin expansion last year, Microsoft is now guiding for a decline in operating margins to pay for the data center capex, increasing from 12% to 21% of revenue, Luria emphasized. This is a higher rate of increase than Amazon and Google due to Microsoft’s greater reliance on Nvidia.\n\nThe analyst said that Microsoft overinvests at these rates yearly, diminishing margins by at least 100 bps cumulatively. To offset the margin drag, Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment.\n\nWhile Nvidia and others have pointed to a strong ROI for hyperscalers such as Azure, Luria flagged that these returns may only last for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst noted Azure’s growth may be boosted by self-funded revenue, such as from OpenAI.\n\nLuria noted Microsoft has also lost much of the lead for GitHub Copilot. Not only have Amazon and Gitlab mostly caught up to GitHub Copilot’s capabilities, he said Cursor has become the new standard.\n\nLuria projected fiscal first-quarter 2025 revenue of $64.2 billion and EPS of $2.96.\n\nPrice Action: MSFT stock is down 0.50% at $433.10 at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for MSFT\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Citigroup Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for MSFT\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "An Outsider Critiqued Meta’s Smart Glasses. Now She’s in Charge of Them",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Li-Chen Miller wasn’t even a Meta Platforms Inc. employee when she started working to fix the company’s video-recording sunglasses.Miller was working at Microsoft Corp. in late 2021 when she purchased a pair of Ray-Ban Stories, the first version of Meta’s souped-up sunglasses. But her excitement about the novel idea was quickly overshadowed by all the ways she thought they could be improved. So she dashed off a detailed — and unsolicited — list of suggested fixes to Alex Himel, Meta’s head of wearables.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads Unlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad AOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\n“She wrote me an email that articulated what she thought was good about the device and what was promising, and then a longer list of things that she would improve,” Himel said, recalling that he agreed with most of the ideas.\n\nMiller’s email and her meticulous attention to detail landed her a job the following year at Meta, where she now oversees products for the entire wearables division, including a full line of the Ray-Ban glasses she previously critiqued. Once more of a novelty, the glasses are becoming increasingly important within Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars researching and building futuristic wearable technology, a bet on his belief that augmented reality glasses, which can overlay images and text on a user’s view of the physical world, will be the next major computing platform. One day, the company has suggested, they may even replace the phone in your pocket.\n\nThat vision will be on display Sept. 25 at Meta’s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California, where the company is expected to unveil an AR glasses prototype that also falls under Miller’s authority, codenamed Orion. While an AR version is still years away from mainstream availability, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are available now, and have been a “bigger hit sooner than we expected,” Zuckerberg told investors last month.While the current edition of Meta-powered Ray-Bans don’t yet have augmented reality capabilities, they do have video cameras, speakers and an AI assistant you can talk to. They’re also significantly more stylish than the Orion glasses are expected to be, and cost $299. That’s been enough to attract more than half a million consumers, according to market research firm IDC, which estimates Meta has shipped upwards of 700,000 pairs of the latest Ray-Bans since their launch in 2023.Meta’s goal is to one day merge these two projects into one product: A fashionable pair of glasses coupled with advanced AR technology. The idea is to get people accustomed to the idea of smart glasses slowly, building up to a pair with full augmented reality capabilities. There’s a “laddering up to AR glasses that we’re certainly going after,” said Heidi Young, Meta’s vice president of engineering.\n\nFor now, the top of that ladder is many rungs away. After years of investment, Meta is still far from delivering a pair of glasses that are stylish enough to work for general consumers but powerful enough to offer AR features. Other companies have tried augmented reality glasses, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Snapchat parent Snap Inc., though neither has found a robust market for their products in part because the glasses look bulky or weird. Eight years after first taking a crack at the wearables market, Snap showed off its own AR glasses, called Spectacles, earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\n\nFor Zuckerberg, successfully blending the Ray-Ban styles with AR features would be the ultimate aim, since owning a widely used pair of AR glasses would mark a step toward decreasing Meta’s reliance on rivals like Apple Inc. and Google. The two companies dominate the smartphone market, which also means they serve as middlemen between Meta’s products and the consumers who use them. Zuckerberg has said that structure has hurt Meta’s business and can be “soul crushing.” If glasses are indeed the future, Zuckerberg wants to own the market.\n\nMiller will have a major role in determining whether Zuckerberg’s vision succeeds. A self-described “crazy cat lady,” she took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference a year ago in a pair of Hello Kitty jeans and a T-shirt featuring a picture of her own cat, Adobo. She delivered an impassioned speech to thousands of software developers about the potential for Meta’s smart glasses. “You no longer have to choose between capturing the moment or truly experiencing it,” she said. Even though the attendees had mostly flocked to Meta’s headquarters to hear more about the company’s latest Quest virtual reality headsets, Miller stole the show.\n\n“They were not there for glasses, and then she took the stage and I think really overpowered the event,” Himel said. “A large percentage of people who went to the event actually bought glasses on the spot and took them home.”\n\nSales savvy aside, Miller’s contributions to Meta’s wearables division are the result of spending almost two decades at Microsoft, where she worked on a collection of consumer products that included Xbox, Windows, Windows Phone and the Bing search engine. It was there that Miller first developed a reputation among colleagues for being “in the weeds” — displaying a knack for the kind of detailed analysis that caught Himel’s eye. “She would be in every single ship room and review we had for the program,” said Marleine Daoud, who worked with Miller on new features for Xbox’s rewards program. That level of involvement was rare for leaders at her level, Daoud said.\n\nMiller also learned the challenges of packing a lot of computing power into tiny devices, said Shiraz Cupala, a product leader for Microsoft Teams, who worked with Miller on bringing Xbox features to Windows Phone. “You have to take into account the constraints of the device to create an experience that really works well and is reliable,” Cupala said. “She has a very strong instinct about how to make those hard decisions.”\n\nThat skillset has been put to use as Miller worked on Meta’s smart glasses, which feel as thin as regular sunglasses but are enhanced by Meta’s virtual assistant, Meta AI, and can take photos, record videos, play music and respond to voice commands. She uses them all the time, sometimes for helpful things, like using the camera and voice assistant to translate a menu in a foreign language, or for mundane things like recording her cats playing around in the living room. Some days, Miller wears the glasses as much as 14 hours.\n\nWhile in Paris this summer to watch the Olympics, for example, Miller brought along three different pairs of Meta’s smart glasses, some of which had unreleased features and technology, to stress test them in the “wild,” according to Himel. When she returned from vacation, she once again handed her boss a list of changes and feedback.\n\n“When you wear a product that much, you do love it,” Young said. “But you also see all of the little flaws and warts all over the product and so you just become doggedly obsessed with fixing those things.” Young credits Miller with having an outsized influence on the product’s look and feel, including the cat-eye shape, which Meta worked on alongside Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica. She also said Miller has pushed hard to improve the camera and its functionality within the glasses to ensure high-quality photos. “If there was one person that put their fingerprint on this product, I would say it’s her,” Young said.\n\nMiller says part of what motivated her to join Meta was the company’s drive to dominate a new category of technology. “I want to work on something that will still be here and be relevant in 10 years,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year. “It was very attractive to me that Meta is very ambitious. Mark puts money where his mouth is.”\n\nMiller wasn’t the only critic of Meta’s first pair of smart glasses from 2021; only 10% of the people who bought them used them monthly, according to the Wall Street Journal. Snap fared even worse with its first effort at glasses several years ago, and the company ended up taking a $40 million writedown for unsold inventory.\n\nZuckerberg seems more optimistic this time. He said advancements in Meta’s AI voice assistant are part of why the current Meta-enabled Ray-Bans are more useful, spurring adoption. “Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them,” he said in July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPalantir’s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank The Man Who Made Nike Uncool In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Five Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google is on the hot seat. Some want to break it up. Good luck",
        "content": "A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here.\n\nThese are perilous times for Google (GOOGL). Still the world’s fourth most-valuable company, earning $100 billion last year, regulators in the U.S. and Europe are increasingly frustrated by Google’s monopoly or near-monopoly. And with several court cases underway on both sides of the Atlantic, regulators and industry players are now talking about breaking Google’s monopolies — possibly by breaking up the company.\n\nBut after more than 15 years as the dominant force in internet search, browsing, and advertising, breaking Google’s monopolies, or even breaking up Google, is hardly a straightforward business.\n\nWe spoke with a number of players and observers in the worlds in which Google operates to learn about the problems, possibilities, and potential pitfalls of ending Google’s upper hand. Here’s what you should know.\n\nWhat’s the problem?\n\nGoogle is in trouble on two major fronts: The Federal Trade Commission says Google has monopolized the internet search industry, and the Department of Justice says Google has monopolized the internet ad industry. There’s a third case in the U.S. relating to Google’s app store, brought by an app maker named Epic Games. In the search case, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the way Google runs its search business is illegal and monopolistic. He’s scheduled hearings on a solution for next spring and said he’ll issue a ruling next summer. The trial in the ad case began this month in Virginia.\n\nThe problem, say the government and people in the ad industry, is that Google owns all three pillars of the ad business: selling ad space for the platforms and websites that host the ads, buying ad space for the companies that want to advertise their products, and then running the exchange on which all the transactions take place.\n\n“There’s no check on Google,” said Matt Wasserlauf, CEO of Blockboard, a company that manages and verifies online advertising for brands. “A $2 trillion company is pretty much calling its own shots, grading its own homework, and doing a lot of destructive damage in this industry.”\n\nGoogle used the classic monopoly-building tactics of eliminating competitors through acquisitions, locking customers into using its products, and controlling how transactions occurred in the online ad market, Julia Tarver Wood, a Justice Department lawyer, said in her opening statement in the Virginia trial. “Google is not here because they are big, they are here because they used that size to crush competition,” she said.\n\nOne of the key problems from advertisers’ perspective is that Google keeps a lid on all the data about who its ads are targeting and how they are performing. The Association of National Advertisers says some $22 billion of paid advertising a year, or one in every four programmatic advertising dollars, is not being seen by the people advertisers are paying to reach. Instead, much of it goes to what the industry calls MFAs, websites that are “manufactured for advertising,” also known as click-farms.\n\n“The practical effect is $22 billion of ad fraud,” Wasserlauf said. “Not only is [your ad] not going to the demographic you bought, it’s not even going in front of people.”\n\nA locked box\n\nAnd advertisers don’t know the scope of the problem because Google has been allowed to keep its data in a locked box, industry players said.\n\n“Nobody has had access to these algorithms, nobody has any reporting or transparency to what has gone on with their ad spend for the last 15 years,” said Ted Sfikas, field chief technology officer for Amplitude, a data analytics company that focuses on advertising. “And if we ask why we lost a bid, for instance, they’ll just say, ‘Next.’ They won’t tell you anything.”\n\nHis own company has a hard time getting customers who use Google Ads because those customers are already locked into Google’s own analytics platform, and even if it’s not giving the best data, it’s good enough for many advertisers.\n\nOne ad industry player, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his company is involved in a legal dispute with Google, explained why Google is able to keep its dominant position even if it’s creating a relatively inefficient business for its customers: “If I’m an advertiser and I can make $2 million by spending $1 million on Google ads that appear mostly on YouTube, I’m like, that’s fine. My CFO is happy, I’m happy, and they’re not thinking too deeply about where did the money go.”\n\nBut because Google controls its data and algorithms, it can also claim a commission for every sale. So it’s not just advertisers who leave money on the table that gets sucked up by inefficient ads, media (including companies like Quartz, that get paid to host ads) also lose out on advertising opportunities, and consumers lose out because they get ads they don’t want (like the repeat ads for the shirt you just bought) and because Google claims commissions for purchases made by consumers it has identified, and those commissions are bundled into the cost of the product, said the player.\n\nHow Google got here\n\nAfter building its near monopoly position in the search market, Google began sewing up the online ad market more than 15 years ago, first with the purchase of online ad marketplace DoubleClick in 2007 for $3.1 billion. The DOJ says DoubleClick now controls more than half the ad market for open-web display transactions. Google then acquired Invite Media and AdMeld, giving it access to advertisers looking to buy ad space and the ability to connect them with publishers. These deals ultimately gave Google control of both the supply and demand sides of online advertising, as well as the exchange where the prices are set and the deals are made.\n\nWood said Google built a “trifecta of monopolies” through the acquisition, and its sheer size, controlling more than 60% of all online ad spending, makes it almost impossible for competitors to enter the market. And given Google’s size and no access to the data it collects or the algorithms that run its business, the few competitors that are out there have little chance to grow.\n\n“Market competition is the answer and regulation is where market competition comes from,” said Davi Ottenheimer, a data scientist at Inrupt, a company focused on web decentralization.\n\nOttenheimer said that innovation comes from focus and regulation, and that in effect, Google has been its own worst enemy by becoming an effective monopoly — positioning itself for an eventual fall.\n\n“What’s lacking here is that Google wasn’t regulated in a way that kept them honest and [that] allowed them to set up a system that is patently unfair for almost everyone who’s interacting with it, except for them,” Ottenheimer said. “No one has been as egregious as Google in trying to set up monopolization as a business model.”\n\nWhat regulators will do is unclear. One choice is to simply split the three pillars into separate companies and ban them from privately coordinating with one another — a common requirement in antitrust breakups. Another would be to require Google to open up its locked box of data, or to prevent it from placing the ads it brokers onto its own platforms, particularly Google Search and YouTube.\n\n“I’d love for them to break it up,” said Lance Wolder, head of strategy at PadSquad, a digital advertising agency. Not only would that lower costs for advertisers and increase revenue for publishers by allowing new entrants into the ad business. It would also unleash opportunities for new creativity, Wolder said: “It would be really meaningful for us to be able to look at the web and look at all the pieces that Google touches as a new canvas to create cool things in terms of the ad experience.”\n\nFixing search\n\nFixing search is a more complicated business. There is no silver bullet that, alone, would adequately address both Google’s scale and distribution advantage, as well as ensure that Google cannot circumvent its obligations.\n\nThe FTC, in its case against Google search, focused on the tens of billions of dollars that Google pays Apple (AAPL) and other smartphone companies each year to make its search engine the default choice on their devices. But Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of search engine DuckDuckGo, a Google competitor, said there’s no one remedy to end Google’s monopoly and come up with better results.\n\n“The ‘remedy’ must be a package of remedies that work together to effectively counteract the unlawful competitive imbalance,” he wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nHis key recommendation: “The best and fastest way to level this playing field is for Google to provide access to its search results via real-time APIs.”\n\nIf Google is forced to license its search results, existing search engines and new players could build on top of Google’s modules and indexes to offer consumers “more competitive and innovative alternatives,” Weinberg added.\n\nThe caveats\n\nAt the end of the day, the government’s case may be too narrow, and after what would likely be years of appeals, regulators may end up applying remedies that no longer work. Still, the scrutiny may be enough to change the way Google operates, and to make advertisers and consumers aware that they do have some choice in how they advertise or search.\n\nBut any fixes may also come too late for Google. “The next curve of innovation is AI driven and they have competition,” said Jonathan Adler, chief marketing officer at experiential marketing agency FGPG. OpenAI, Perplexity and other AI-driven platforms are already encroaching on Google’s home turf, the search for answers — answers to what causes earthquakes or where to buy dishwasher detergent. “I don’t think they’re scrambling,” Adler said, “ but they’re having to be very strategic with their AI investment to make sure that they hold on to their competitive advantage and build on the data they already have.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has recently seen its shares trade off from $193 to $158, representing a more than an 18% drop, as investors have arguably been discounting both competitive and regulatory pressures the company is currently facing.\n\nWe think this recent decline is largely exaggerated and that the stock is starting to get cheap again, both fundamentally and relative to industry peers. In addition, we also think investors may be discounting and overlooking the Google parent's moat relative to other big tech players, which are trading at significantly higher valuations. Finally, we look at the risks to our thesis and what investors should be aware of when looking at the stock. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nGoogle's moat is underrated\n\nOne thing we think is often overlooked when analyzing Alphabet is the qualitative aspect of how much moat the company actually has. While it is easy to judge Apple's iPhone moat and ecosystem, Google has done a pretty good job of being a stronghold for consumers in multiple domains, with some services seen as very essential.\n\nIn fact, we believe consumers would find it difficult to see a world without Alphabet's ecosystem, which ranges from Gmail, Android, Google Cloud, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, Google Maps and Google News, to name a few. In addition, after all these years, we think the company has created a very strong brand loyalty among its users, most of whom choose Google Chrome as their default web browser even when presented with another choice.\n\nEarlier this year, in March, new rules went into effect in the European Union, allowing users to choose which default browser to use, but this did not seem to have a substantial impact on Google's market share, which is another sign of its strong brand loyalty. We believe that even if Google is ordered to stop making payments to other companies, such as $20 billion to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for using Google Search as the default Web browser, it probably would not hurt Alphabet as much as it would hurt the other companies in question.\n\nIn general, just the data advantage Alphabet currently has over competitors, as well as the perceived accuracy advantage they seemingly have with Google Search, seems to be a dealbreaker for many users. Regardless, Google Search remains Alphabet's bread and butter, with the segment accounting for more than 57% of total revenue. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nAnother reason we think the company's moat is undervalued is the fact some of Google's business units, such as YouTube, could be worth more than publicly traded top-tier competitors. For example, YouTube ads alone pulled in $7.67 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter, compared with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which earned $9.56 billion in revenue last quarter. YouTube, on the other hand, has 2.7 billion active users versus Netflix, which has 277.65 million active subscribers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, we think YouTube is just at the beginning of monetizing its user base with YouTube Premium. In general, it would be quite conservative to give YouTube a rating similar to Netflix's, even though the number of minutes watched annually on YouTube is significantly higher than Netflix. Netflix, on the other hand, is currently trading with a market cap of $292 billion. And while many pointed out that YouTube's revenue this quarter fell short of expectations by $8.67 billion, or 13.02% year over year, revenue from Google Subscriptions, which includes the strong growth of YouTube Premium, rose 14.37% year over year to $9.31 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud is also gaining momentum, with operating income up $395 million to $1.17 billion, while margins increased from 9.40% last quarter to 11.30% this quarter. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nValuation headed for cheap territory\n\nOne of the most attractive features of Alphabet among big tech players, more specifically the Magnificent Seven, is the fact it is the cheapest of them all at certain valuations. On an enterprise value/Ebit basis, for example, the stock trades at only a ratio of 18.37, compared to other Magnificent Seven companies that typically trade at a multiple of at least 20 to 35 times. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nOverall, also looking at forward-looking estimates, Alphabet is trading at a mere 15.82 times 2026 forward price-earnings, against an expected $10.01 earnings per share. Moreover, the company has a massive $100.73 billion buffer of cash on its balance sheet. However, we noticed quite a difference between the figures in the income statement and free cash flow.\n\nFor example, if we look at operating income on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow usually follows operating income pretty closely. In this case, we looked at free cash flow net of stock-based compensation. As you can see, as of the third quarter of 2023, adjusted free cash flow is significantly lower than normal compared to operating income. This difference is mainly due to higher investments due to spending on hardware for AI infrastructure, as well as changes in accounting from 2023, extending the life of their servers and hardware from four to five years to six years. With respect to the significant investments in AI infrastructure, it also remains to be seen whether this will translate into future flows of free cash flow. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nAnother key benefit for Alphabet investors is the fact it has used almost all of its free cash flow and sometimes some of its cash reserves to return capital to investors in the form of share repurchases. On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has repurchased $63.36 billion worth of shares while generating $60.79 billion in free cash flow. Outside of innovation in AI models, Alphabet is still going strong with initiatives such as Waymo, expanding its autonomous car fleet and recently partnering with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to integrate with existing Uber customers.\n\nThe bearish thesis\n\nHowever, there are risks to our bullish thesis as there are some macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds to keep in mind. First, in terms of legislative risks, Google is under scrutiny from several angles, both in the EU and in the United States, mainly regarding antitrust issues. In the United States, a judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, with the current lawsuit, with the plaintiff's request to have the company at least sell Google Ad Manager, ongoing, according to a report.\n\nIn the EU, the company just lost its appeal against a $2.42 billion fine over its comparison shopping service. Alphabet is also fighting two other fines around Google's practices with Android and the Google AdSense platform. The way we see these issues is that most of these rulings are likely to take several years to resolve, especially if it appeals. Moreover, by the time there is a ruling, Google may have enough competition from AI, for example with OpenAI's SearchGPT over ads. The company should also be able to easily pay these fines with the huge amounts of free cash flow it generates, as highlighted earlier.\n\nThe biggest problems we believe Alphabet may face in the short to medium term are at the macroeconomic level. First, the yield curve, more specifically the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields, is back in positive territory after being deeply inverted for about two years, which is a strong indicator that a recession is likely near. The Sahm Rule, which indicates the change in unemployment, also recently crossed the 0.50 threshold and currently stands at 0.57. At 0.57, a recession is usually imminent. Previous times when this value reached 0.57, there was always a recession. Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines\n\nWhile many investors will view the recent announcement of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve positively, we want to remind people that interest rate cuts are reactive and not preventive. Usually, when interest rates are cut, unemployment has already risen dramatically and the United States is already in recession, with stock indexes down significantly. In addition, we would also be wary of insider trading in recent years with Alphabet, given that there have been almost no insider purchases and quite a few insider sales by management and directors.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn conclusion, we think Alphabet is getting cheap on both a fundamental, historical and relative basis, with the stock likely trading at a discount to other big tech companies due to what we see as overblown competitive and regulatory pressures. We also think investors are discounting or overlooking Google's moat in several areas.\n\nIn reality, Alphabet is not just another search engine, but a company that has a huge data advantage over its competitors and is able to provide a far superior service, as evidenced by the fact it did not lose material market share in the EU following a decision to let consumers decide which browser to use. The main downside that we think investors should consider at this time is on the macroeconomic front, where we think a recession is very near and could negatively impact Alphabet in the short to medium term. Finally, we would also pay attention to the widening gap between free cash flow and operating income in upcoming earnings reports.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: This Major Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Compete With Nvidia in the Not-Too-Distant Future",
        "content": "What happens when a company's largest customers become fierce competitors? Imagine that you own the largest chocolate chip company in the land. You sell to all the largest grocery chains because you have the best recipe. But every day, those stores pour money into finding the next-best recipe. If they create it, it could be a recipe for disaster (pardon the pun).\n\nThis is Nvidia's reality now. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, and Amazon are spending billions on Nvidia GPUs while also spending billions developing competing products. The key for Nvidia is to stay one step ahead. But it won't be easy with such deep-pocketed competitors.\n\nAlphabet is serious competition\n\nAs shown below, the four massive tech companies mentioned above reportedly account for nearly 40% of Nvidia's revenue, which exploded to $96 billion over the past 12 months. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nOf this, 85% comes from Nvidia's data center division. Whatever company can encroach on Nvidia's massive market share of reportedly 70% to 95% in artificial intelligence (AI) chips will benefit in two ways: increased income and reduced expenses. After all, much of that giant ramp in Nvidia's revenue, depicted above, comes from other big tech companies' pockets.\n\nNvidia is leading due to its groundbreaking H100 GPU, which delivers unparalleled performance. These units are critical for data centers, large language models, and generative AI, so Nvidia can't keep up with demand and the margins are gigantic.\n\nAlphabet is developing and improving its competing AI product, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). It launched the sixth-generation TPU, Trillium, earlier this year. With five times more speed and 67% more energy efficiency, sixth-gen Trillium is a considerable leap over version five.\n\nTrillium doesn't compete directly on the open market with Nvidia. Instead, customers rent space on Google Cloud, allowing Alphabet a broader customer base. The ability to rent space will be intense competition for Nvidia as companies can choose to rent rather than make capital investments. And, of course, Alphabet uses it internally.\n\nIs Alphabet stock a buy now?\n\nAlphabet can pour capital into AI projects because it is hugely profitable and generates massive cash flow from its core advertising (Google Search and YouTube) and Google Cloud segments. These segments generated $84 billion in sales last quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase that came with $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nAlso impressive is that the operating margin for Google Cloud increased from 5% to 11% year over year. The increase in margin is a clear indication of increased efficiency and growing demand. As you can see below, Google Cloud's growth has been remarkable in recent years.\n\nStory continues Image source: Statista.\n\nEven after growing nearly fourfold since 2020, AI will increase Google Cloud's sales. For Alphabet, investments in AI, Google Cloud, and generative chatbots that rival ChatGPT, like Gemini, are crucial to the long-term path.\n\nMicrosoft Bing is challenging Google Search by harnessing ChatGPT through its billion-dollar investment in its creator, OpenAI. Plus, generative AI may encroach on the search market. However, there is no need to sound an alarm yet; Google Search grew 14% last quarter to $49 billion in revenue and remains far and away the market leader.\n\nAlphabet stock looks like a bargain in a market where many tech stocks are trading well above historical valuations. As shown below, Microsoft trades 14% above its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, while Alphabet trades 12% below. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe historical undervaluation, quality core business, and potential to compete for part of Nvidia's market dominance make Alphabet stock an intelligent buy for tech investors and those looking for GARP (growth at a reasonable price) companies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Secret Portfolio Is Dumping Shares of 3 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (No, Not Nvidia!)",
        "content": "Few if any money managers command the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,500,000%, and briefly witnessed his company surpass a $1 trillion market cap.\n\nInvestors often wait on pins and needles for the quarterly release of Berkshire's Form 13F. A 13F provides investors with a concise snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter.\n\nBut here's something that might come as a bit of a surprise: Berkshire Hathaway's 13F fails to tell the full story of what's under the company's hood. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has a secret $602 million portfolio, and three AI stocks are getting the heave-ho\n\nIn 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Re in an all-share deal valued at $22 billion. Although the crown jewel of this deal was General Re's reinsurance operations, it also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When the deal finalized in December 1998, Buffett became the new owner of NEAM.\n\nInstitutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file a 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of the June-ended quarter, New England Asset Management held $602 million in securities, and is therefore required to disclose what stocks have been bought and sold.\n\nEven though Warren Buffett doesn't manage the assets held by NEAM the same way he does for the 43-stock, $309 billion portfolio he oversees at Berkshire Hathaway, what NEAM owns is, ultimately, under the umbrella of Buffett's company. Thus, New England Asset Management is, effectively, Warren Buffett's $602 million secret portfolio.\n\nSimilar to Buffett's trading activity over the last two years, the advisors overseeing NEAM's portfolio have predominantly been net-sellers of equities. What was once a portfolio that boasted $6.3 billion of assets, as of the March-ended quarter in 2022, now holds \"just\" $602 million in securities, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nMost notably, Buffett's secret portfolio has been dumping its holdings in three high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) stocks -- and no, Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe first high-flying AI stock that's being given the heave-ho by the asset managers of Buffett's hidden portfolio is networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). New England Asset Management reduced its stake in the company by 19% in the June-ended quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no denying that Broadcom has been a clear beneficiary of the rise of AI. Its networking solutions, which are designed to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing potential of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs), have quickly become staples in enterprise data centers tasked with running generative AI solutions and training large language models.\n\nBut what investors, including those at NEAM, might be overlooking is that Broadcom is much more than just an AI networking solutions provider. For instance, it's one of the leading wireless chip and accessory providers for next-generation smartphones. Wireless carriers upgrading their networks to support 5G download speeds has led to a sustained device replacement cycle that's clearly benefiting Broadcom.\n\nBroadcom is also a key supplier of optical components used in automated industrial equipment, networking solutions for next-gen vehicles, and cybersecurity solutions.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Broadcom occasionally leans on acquisitions to expand its product and service ecosystem and improve cross-selling opportunities. Its latest acquisition -- a $69 billion deal to buy cloud-based virtualization software company VMware, which closed last year -- should help it become a key player in private and hybrid enterprise clouds.\n\nThe only logical reason to sell shares of Broadcom is if you believe the AI bubble is going to burst -- and there are plenty of signs to suggest this could happen. While an AI bubble-bursting event would, undoubtedly, hurt Broadcom's stock, its business is well-diversified and able to navigate whatever is thrown its way. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nA second AI stock that the money managers of Warren Buffett's $602 million secret portfolio appear to be souring on is the second-largest publicly traded company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). During the second quarter, a hair over 20% of NEAM's stake in Microsoft was shown the door.\n\nMicrosoft is integrating AI into a variety of its operating segments. This includes offering generative AI solutions to its Azure clients. Azure is the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform and has consistently been Microsoft's fastest-growing operating segment. With most businesses still early in their cloud-spending cycle, Azure can likely be counted on for sustained double-digit sales growth.\n\nMicrosoft has also been inorganically investing in the AI revolution. For instance, it's a core investor in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT. OpenAI assisted Microsoft in relaunching its Bing search engine and Edge browser with AI capabilities.\n\nFurther, Microsoft and BlackRock announced plans last week to launch a $30 billion fund that'll invest in various AI infrastructure. Microsoft is flush with cash, and its management team has demonstrated a willingness to expand its product and service ecosystem by putting it to work.\n\nSo, why sell a fifth of NEAM's Microsoft stake if the company is firing on all cylinders? The answer probably lies with Microsoft's valuation.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Sept. 17, Microsoft was valued at nearly 32 times consensus earnings per share for fiscal 2026 (ended June 30, 2026). This is about 7% higher than its average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple over the trailing-five-year period, and is a somewhat aggressive earnings multiple given how pricey the stock market is right now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock in Buffett's $602 million secret portfolio that's been sent to the chopping block is Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Specifically, the managers at NEAM sold nearly 28% of their fund's stake in Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL) in the second quarter.\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet should see a lot of its AI-related growth stem from generative AI solution integration with its cloud infrastructure service platform.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform by total spending, and it became profitable on a recurring basis last year. Since the margins associated with cloud services are usually much higher than advertising margins, Google Cloud has a chance to be Alphabet's primary driver of operating cash flow by the turn of the decade.\n\nFor the time being, Alphabet's foundational operating segment continues to be its Google search engine. For more than nine years, Google has accounted for no less than 90% of the monthly share of global internet search. This makes it the clear go-to for advertisers and affords Alphabet phenomenal ad-pricing power.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet is sitting on almost $111 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet's balance sheet gives it a level of financial flexibility that few companies can match.\n\nGiven that Alphabet is historically cheap, NEAM's selling of Alphabet stock is a bit of a head-scratcher. The best guesses as to why Buffett's secret portfolio is dumping shares of Alphabet is the growing likelihood of the AI bubble bursting and stocks, as a whole, being expensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers.\n\nWhile the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said.\n\n“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing.\n\nNvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one.\n\nHere’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips.\n\nAlphabet Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2017 Conference on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million.\n\n“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion.\n\n“Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said.\n\nAnd while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24.\n\nGoogle announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories.\n\nWith 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities.\n\nIn August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nAmazon Amazon fulfillment center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nMonths after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times.\n\nIn April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan.\n\nWhile Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nIn March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever.\n\nMeta Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April.\n\nMeta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B.\n\nMeta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4.\n\nMicrosoft Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella at CES 2024 on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps.\n\nThe AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.”\n\nMicrosoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said.\n\nTesla Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. - Photo: Christian Marquardt - Pool (Getty Images)\n\nTesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging.\n\n“There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.”\n\nIn September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app.\n\nTesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap.\n\nMusk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.”\n\nOpenAI OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during OpenAI DevDay on November 6, 2023 in San Francisco, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nWhen it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors.\n\nIn September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks.\n\nIn May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design​. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets – over 20% – to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. News publication Bloomberg recently reported that officials of the European Union are in the process of preparing a chargesheet against Google under the Digital Markets Act. The chargesheet would allow the EU to impose a heavy fine on the tech giant and compel changes to the business model of Google. Product results from rivals occupying a more prominent position on different Google search services are one of many bones of contention. The penalties for inaction could reach up to 10% of global annual revenue.\n\nDA Davidson recently initiated coverage of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. In a research note, the advisory detailed that as the company faced challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity would migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning was mixed. Analysts at the advisory expect Alphabet to continue trading at a discount to other mega-caps unless it becomes more aggressive in pursuing those opportunities.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The potential investor upside of a Google breakup — if John Rockefeller is any guide",
        "content": "Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) legal troubles could force it to sell off some of its prized businesses, but investors worried about that outcome may find some comfort in what happened to John Rockefeller’s Standard Oil more than a century ago.\n\nThe empire that controlled nearly all US oil production during America’s industrial revolution had to split into 34 smaller companies after the Supreme Court in 1911 sided with the Justice Department in an antitrust challenge.\n\nThe divestiture of those companies made Rockefeller the richest man in the world. But it also made other shareholders in those new companies richer too, according to legal experts.\n\nThe companies became giants such as Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) that still rule the industry today.\n\n“[T]he market cap total for all those companies increased about five- to six-fold based on what the valuation was thought for Standard Oil,” said Boston College Law School antitrust law professor David Olson. John D. Rockefeller, who watched the oil empire he built broken into 34 smaller companies at the beginning of the last century.\n\nNew management and efficiencies that followed the breakup helped the smaller companies flourish, added Susman Godfrey antitrust litigation attorney Barry Barnett.\n\nIn the case of Google, existing shareholders may benefit as a scaled-back company tends to boost innovation and customer service, Barnett said. Google's search engine, for example, could start producing more relevant results and become more valuable to advertisers.\n\n\"The people who own the company are not going to lose,\" Barnett said.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this rosy view. One analyst at Evercore ISI recently reduced a price target on Alphabet, Google’s parent company, after rereading a federal judge’s landmark US antitrust ruling against the company handed down in August.\n\nUS District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who decided the case, sided with the US Justice Department’s claims that Google’s Search business was an illegal monopoly that it abused to keep rivals at bay.\n\nMehta also agreed with the DOJ’s accusations that Google illegally monopolized the market for online search text advertising.\n\n\"[W]e believe a ‘worst case’ scenario is a more likely scenario than the market assumes,\" Evercore’s analyst wrote in the note.\n\nIt is not yet known what remedies the judge may approve as a result of his ruling.\n\nThey could range from an outright breakup of Google to forcing the company to make its search engine data, its \"index,\" available to competitors.\n\nIt could also be forced to end the types of agreements that got Google into trouble with regulators, that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeorge Alan Hay, Cornell University law and economics professor and former DOJ antitrust division chief, said the DOJ is likely to request “some form of divestiture” where Google is found to have violated the law.\n\n\"It would be significant. It wouldn’t be backbreaking,\" he said. \"Google could survive.\"\n\nOne concern for stockholders is that a breakup could affect Google’s huge profit engine. In 2023, Google Search generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, both of which it promotes on its general search engine, advertising on the platforms accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nIn October 2020, when the DOJ and states filed suit, Google's annual revenue was roughly half of that, totaling $162 billion.\n\nNot all breakups of business empires have led to positive results, at least in the immediate aftermath.\n\nConsider the breakup of the AT&T (T) telecom network in the 1980s that followed seven years of litigation with the DOJ.\n\nThe Justice Department sued AT&T in 1974, seeking a breakup of its phone service and phone equipment monopolies. It got most of what it wanted in 1984 following a 1982 settlement that created a number of regional companies. An abandoned Standard Oil gas station in Arizona. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1870. (Photo by John van Hasselt/Corbis via Getty Images) (John van Hasselt - Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nBut AT&T lost significant long-distance revenue to newcomers MCI and Sprint. From 1984 to 1996, its share of total long-distance revenue fell from 91% to 48%.\n\nBut Barnett said he expects a breakup of Google to impact its shareholders the way that Standard Oil's breakup did.\n\n\"So if you're an Alphabet shareholder, this may be good for you.\" StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offers up this reminder to investors before his big birthday",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI think I have fully processed my time spent at Salesforce's (CRM) annual extravaganza in San Francisco, known as Dreamforce.\n\nThis was my fourth Dreamforce, and it was fascinating per usual — including a dinner at the top of the 61-floor Salesforce Tower with Matthew McConaughey (a longtime friend and pitchman for the SaaS giant), Will.i.Am, Metallica lead drummer Lars Ulrich, one of Nvidia's (NVDA) founding GPU creators, and Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei (who gave some great brief remarks on artificial intelligence).\n\nThis dinner ended with an acoustic performance by Alanis Morissette, who sang four songs that reminded me that, at one point over the last 42 years, I did have a personal life (filled with the teenage heartbreak that only fed my appetite for sappy Alanis songs on Myspace).\n\nI digress.\n\nNow that I've digested this latest West Coast tech swing, I'm here to say it's good to see Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff back to being Marc Benioff.\n\nI realize that as a journalist, I'm supposed to be critical, and I am. Salesforce shocked the hell out of the market in late May with a weak outlook, and the stock got hammered. Not a lovely look.\n\nBut I can't completely turn off the analyst DNA in me that still exists deep down.\n\nAnd on that score, I liked what I saw from Benioff at Dreamforce from a few different perspectives.\n\nI saw a founder pull thousands of employees into his vision of an AI future during a keynote. The room full of \"trailblazers\" — as Salesforce employees are called — was hanging on to his every word. The group was ready to run through a wall for Benioff, essential when you are trying to deploy a billion autonomous AI agents and deliver for Wall Street each quarter.\n\nIt was also significant that Benioff mostly did the keynote himself, only yielding the mic a few times.\n\n\"The reason is I think he feels that this is a very pivotal moment for his company, for the industry, and for the technology,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan — who was also in attendance — told me.\n\n\"When these entrepreneurs like Marc and Oracle's Larry Ellison that have founded their companies and have this deep sense of connection to the companies, and they understand those pivotal moments, it is like they kick into high gear and all they can think about is getting the company to be on the right side of technology.\"\n\nStory continues Salesforce co-founder & CEO Marc Benioff gives his keynote address at Dreamforce 2024. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nI saw a founder deeply engaged in the products he was pitching to the masses — not reading off talking points supplied by team members. Benioff even turned the tables and quizzed me on the Opening Bid podcast about what I learned from a product demo at the event. You can catch that exchange in the above video.\n\nIf he thought he was going to catch this fella flat-footed, hell no! Forever prepared!\n\nI saw a founder perhaps doing what very few in corporate America could do: bring together huge names to drive meaningful discussions, which often transformed into convos about Salesforce innovations and their longtime personal ties with Benioff.\n\nBenioff has one of the most extensive networks I've seen, and trust me, that has paid dividends for Salesforce in terms of reputation, business wins, and getting things done quickly.\n\n\"Marc can turn this ship like no one else when he gets an idea in his head,\" one Benioff confidant told me at the Salesforce Tower dinner.\n\nBy all indications, Benioff is back to aggressively driving that huge Salesforce boat — shaking off the activist attacks that transpired a little while back.\n\n\"If I'm not enjoying it — I'm not doing it, and I think that I'm really enjoying Salesforce. I love it. I feel like we've done seminal work, especially in the last 18 months. We've gotten the company to the point where it is an absolute leader, where everyone is having to respond,\" Benioff remarked when asked to reflect ahead of his big 60th birthday on Sept. 25.\n\nSo all this raises the question: Why isn't there more optimism priced into Salesforce's stock?\n\nIts shares trade on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. Microsoft (MSFT) trades at 33 times, whereas Oracle (ORCL) (Ellison is a mentor of Benioff's dating back to his time at the company) is at 27 times. Salesforce quasi-rival ServiceNow (NOW) trades on a 53 times forward multiple.\n\nPros tell me the Street is generally worried about Salesforce's propensity to spend big on acquisitions, which weighed on margins and free cash flow in the past. Others still aren't sold on Salesforce monetizing its new AI initiatives.\n\nBut they all generally agree that the stock does appear cheap on a relative and historical basis.\n\n\"I would go far enough to say that not much optimism [at all] is being priced into Salesforce's stock right now,\" Rangan said. \"The stock is pricing in as if there is no growth at all, which is absolutely ridiculous. So not only AI optimism is not priced in, there's no optimism being priced in.\"\n\nSalesforce's guidance calls for sales growth of 7% this year and up to 25% operating cash flow growth, FYI.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic about this company,\" Rangan said. \"People tend to dismiss Marc — but I'm a big bull on the company.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Fed's preferred inflation gauge and second quarter GDP: What to know this week",
        "content": "The rate cut that everyone was waiting for finally arrived. Markets offered a resoundingly positive response to the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign. But the euphoria was only fleeting. Friday's trading brought fresh concerns over corporate earnings and economic growth.\n\nStocks, however, still posted overall wins for the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week up about 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 1.5%. While Friday brought down the S&P, the index notched an all-time high earlier in the week and the Dow closed with a record.\n\nThe biggest question for investors this upcoming week is whether a new batch of data supports Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assertion that the US economy remains strong.  A second quarter GDP reading due Thursday will help test that contention.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell was also careful not to declare a victory over inflation as pricing pressures continue to come down. Friday's scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will offer another progress report on that front.\n\nQuarterly earnings reports from Costco (COST), Micron (MU), and Accenture (ACN) are also on deck.\n\nWhat's next for the Fed?\n\nThe quiet period is over and so is the tightening. The public is set to receive fresh commentary from Fed officials in the days after the momentous shift away from a restrictive monetary policy. Perhaps the biggest question for policymakers is, where do we go from here?\n\nAt least eight central bank officials, including Powell, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr, and New York Fed chief John Williams, are scheduled to offer speeches or participate in conferences in the days ahead, likely giving color to the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Fed members see two more 25 basis point cuts this year, followed by four more in 2025.\n\nPowell has said the central bank was not playing catch-up in opting for a larger rate cut, addressing criticism that the Fed should have eased rates at their last policy huddle in July. He's also stated that cuts of 50 basis points shouldn't be thought of as the new norm. But a greater slowdown in the labor market could challenge both of his contentions.\n\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThe new risks and the old\n\nInflation was so high and the job market so tight that curbing price increases was the Fed's sole focus over the last two years. But now that inflation is cooling and the job market showing signs of slowing, the Fed has to advance its mandate on both fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday Powell noted the upside risks to inflation have diminished while the downside risks to employment have increased. \"We know it is time to recalibrate our policy,\" he said, confirming that the balance of risks is \"now even.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Friday's PCE reading to come in at 2.3% year over year, down from the prior month's 2.5% annual increase, according to Bloomberg data. Such a favorable metric would continue a downward climb and affirm the Fed's decision making. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut even as more eyes are on the labor market, the Fed still hasn't met its inflation goal of 2%. And as central bankers have reiterated, stepping off the brakes too early could allow heightened inflation to pick back up.\n\nAs Bank of America Global Research analysts put it in a note on Friday, \"With above-potential growth, a strong consumer, and a record-breaking stock market, such a bold start to an easing cycle is hard to justify if a recession isn't imminent.\"\n\n\"Unless the Fed is seeing something that we are missing, a more aggressive easing cycle could make reaching the 2% target harder considering uncertainty ahead, including the aftermath of US elections,\" they wrote.\n\nTech stock reset\n\nTech investors have been on the hunt for their next catalyst, and the Fed may have just handed it to them. After a mixed earnings season where Wall Street largely soured on massive AI spending and flashed impatience for less-than-perfect quarters, the rate-sensitive sector could revert back to growth mode.\n\nAll but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks posted gains last week, with Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) all outpacing the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA), the sole loser, shed more than 2% last week as it grapples with volatility after a stunning spring and summer rise. Still, some analysts see a more nuanced picture. As Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned, the upside of even the most high-flying tech stocks is limited as the ability to match their prior growth becomes more difficult.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Take Advantage of the Next Wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investing",
        "content": "Nvidia has been the king of the first wave of artificial intelligence (AI) investing. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are being purchased by the truckload by the biggest cloud computing and AI modeling companies. Eventually, if they have all the computing power they want, Nvidia's business would decline as new computing capacity wouldn't be needed.\n\nThis will give way to the next wave of AI investments, and if you're looking to cash in on this trend, I've got three companies that are slated to do well.\n\nCloud computing is going to grow tremendously\n\nThe next wave will benefit companies currently training and developing AI models or those offering cloud computing services to companies developing AI. The major cloud computing players are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). As the industry leaders, they have been some of the largest purchasers of Nvidia's GPUs in recent quarters.\n\nAll three also have affiliations with generative AI models, with Amazon and Microsoft investing in and partnering with Anthropic and Open AI, respectively. Alphabet is developing its generative AI model, Gemini, in-house. With all three companies having strong ties to top-tier generative AI models, they have properly positioned themselves to provide users with the tools they need to create AI models.\n\nHowever, having a generative AI model for cloud computing clients is just table stakes for a much larger game. Many workloads are still processed on-site at businesses around the globe. While some of these workloads may never migrate to the cloud, a large majority will. This is why the cloud computing market opportunity is expected to increase from $676 billion in 2024 to $2.3 trillion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nBecause it is easy to scale up or down the computing power you rent in the cloud, it is ideal for training in-house AI models, as businesses don't have to buy expensive computing power from companies like Nvidia permanently. With the general trend toward the cloud being accelerated by AI demand, it's clear this will be a huge investment trend.\n\nBut does that make all three stocks buys?\n\nAll three stocks have unique price points\n\nThe wrinkle with each of these companies is that cloud computing isn't the only thing they do. While cloud computing continues to be one of the best (if not the best) performing segments in each of these businesses, other core businesses steer the stocks. Additionally, the prices you must pay for the stocks vary widely.\n\nStory continues AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAmazon is the most expensive, but that's because it has the most potential in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud computing. But because Amazon's ancillary businesses are all fairly low-margin, AWS accounts for 64% of its operating profit despite only contributing 18% of revenue. This means that if AWS sees brisk growth, Amazon's profits will quickly rise, decreasing Amazon's expensive valuation rapidly.\n\nAlthough Amazon technically is more expensive from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, I'd argue that Microsoft is the most expensive. Its business has steadily grown revenue, but its profit margins have remained relatively flat. As a result, there really isn't any big upside for Microsoft; it must maintain its status quo to retain its premium price tag. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nLast is Alphabet, which is actually cheaper than the broader market (measured by the S&P 500, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings). Alphabet doesn't have the premium valuation of its peers because it has been behind on several key product launches, but that doesn't mean it can't be a solid investment. Alphabet has much to gain from its cloud computing wing because it is just starting to turn profitable and could be a huge boost to profits as it moves toward AWS-like margins.\n\nAll three cloud computing businesses have merits, but Amazon and Alphabet stand out as better investment options than Microsoft right now, solely based on their potential to grow profits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Which brands own the most iconic sneaker lines?",
        "content": "Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas AG (ETR:ADSGN) dominate the market for iconic sneaker lines, outpacing other sportswear brands by a significant margin.\n\nBoth companies continue to rely on their longstanding, recognizable silhouettes to generate sales, with Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) showing a strong performance recently.\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analysts, Adidas' top-line growth has been strong, with the company reporting an impressive 15.8% organic sales growth in the quarter ending June 2024. This is better than competitors like Nike, which reported flat growth, and Puma SE (ETR:PUMG), which grew by just 2.1%.\n\nIn contrast to earlier quarters, where Adidas' growth was slightly lower, the recent surge highlights the brand's ability to capitalize on key trends, particularly the popularity of its \"terrace\" sneakers.\n\nThe \"terrace\" trend—largely driven by iconic models like the Samba, Gazelle, and Spezial—has been a key driver of Adidas' momentum. According to Morgan Stanley, the sale of these models could rise to 20 million pairs in 2024, up from 7 million in 2023, contributing to 40% of the company's underlying growth this year.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the trend may have peaked in the second quarter of 2024, with a slowdown in online search interest according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends data.\n\nDespite these concerns, Adidas’ wholesale sales for the third quarter of 2024 are expected to accelerate by 25% year-on-year, up from 17% in the second quarter. Channel checks by Morgan Stanley also indicate that sales of \"terrace\" models remain strong, especially in Europe, where the trend began before expanding to the U.S. and Asia.\n\nThe report also points out that Adidas has historically struggled to maintain the life cycle of its key franchises compared to Nike, which has kept models like the Air Force 1 relevant for years.\n\nHowever, under the leadership of CEO Bjorn Gulden, who joined in January 2023, Adidas appears more focused on improving this aspect. The brand has adopted strategies to extend the product life cycle, such as launching limited-edition collaborations and injecting freshness into existing lines with new colors and twists.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhich brands own the most iconic sneaker lines?\n\nNFL-Hall of Fame quarterback Favre says he has Parkinson's Disease\n\nSherri Shepherd forges path to Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A senior Google executive sought to refute the US Justice Department’s antitrust case over its display advertising technology business, testifying that it faces “fierce competition” from the likes of Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\n\nBut the federal judge overseeing the trial in Virginia called the testimony “highly questionable” and potentially “tainted” given that Google officials had known about antitrust concerns over the ad tools since the US opened its probe in 2019.\n\nThe Justice Department, which accused the Alphabet Inc. unit of monopolizing online ad technology tools, rested its case Friday after two weeks of testimony. That allowed Google to start presenting its defense, calling as the company’s first witness Scott Sheffer, vice president of partnerships.\n\nSheffer, an 18-year veteran of Google, walked through the company’s various products and pointed out dozens of online rivals that provide “fierce competition” in the business.\n\nUS District Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide whether Google violated the law, chastised the company’s lawyers for presenting testimony she viewed as irrelevant.\n\n“This doesn’t get to the core issues in this case,” she said, questioning Sheffer’s views on ad tech competition because the company has been aware of antitrust probes for more than four years. A group of state attorneys general filed an antitrust suit over the alleged monopolization in 2020 and the Justice Department filed its own case last year.\n\nSheffer said that Google has recently lost some clients to Microsoft Corp., which purchased AT&T Inc.’s ad tech business in 2022. Also that year, Netflix Inc. moved from Google to Microsoft’s advertising tools, in part, he said, because the Windows maker offered a financial guarantee that was “quite large.”\n\nSheffer also detailed Google’s recent partnerships with X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and Roku Inc., but Brinkema ruled that the company couldn’t offer the evidence because it had failed to disclose the information to the government earlier in the case.\n\nGoogle is expected to continue its defense next week, after which the Justice Department will have an opportunity to recall witnesses before the trial concludes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe government has alleged that Google manipulates the $677 billion display advertising market in violation of antitrust laws, building up a “trifecta of monopolies” to lock up the technology behind website ads and harm publishers and advertisers — claims Google has denied.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A hacker responsible for a cybercrime campaign that impacted up to 165 companies this summer is still at large and recently broke into a “handful” of new organizations, according to a cybersecurity specialist at Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\n\nThe attacker, who previously stole data from customers of cloud analytics company Snowflake Inc., has since targeted American firms and compromised critical infrastructure organizations based in Russia and Bangladesh, according to Austin Larsen, senior threat analyst at Google who’s been investigating the campaign for months.\n\nUS victims are in the health care, technology and telecommunications industries, Larsen said.\n\nThat such a prolific hacker has evaded law enforcement despite bragging about the attacks to journalists and security researchers in recent months exemplifies the challenge that cross-border cybercrime poses to law enforcement, thanks to anonymizing communication services and a burgeoning criminal market for stolen credentials.\n\nAn analysis of the hacker’s online interactions indicated they were likely a male based in Canada in their 20s who displayed Nazi sympathies, Larsen said. He declined to identify the hacker by name or say if their identity had been passed on to law enforcement.\n\nThe hacker recently shared screenshots of records stolen from Russian and Bangladeshi critical infrastructure companies on Telegram, including sensitive customer data, Larsen said. Some intrusions are ongoing, he added.\n\nThe attacker gained access to victim organizations by logging onto internet-based login portals or services using stolen passwords purchased on the dark web. The hacker, who Larsen said may be working with others, has a “huge amount of stolen credentials” at least totaling in the hundreds of thousands from numerous organizations around the world. Once inside they could steal data and extort victims, Larsen warned.\n\n“The actor continues to cause harm, compromise additional companies and extort, in some cases,” Larsen said.\n\nIn June and July, companies including AT&T Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and Advanced Auto Parts Inc. disclosed they’d been affected as part of a campaign in which a hacker stole personal data about millions of people. The cybercrime campaign occurred after a hacker broke into misconfigured Snowflake systems to access sensitive data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hacker is no longer targeting Snowflake-related data but exploiting tools from another software provider, which Larsen declined to name.\n\nLarsen presented his findings on Friday at the LABScon cyber conference in Arizona.\n\nIn June, a person claiming to be the same hacker — and using a pseudonym verified by Larsen — told Bloomberg News over an online chat that they expected to be paid $20 million for the full suite of Snowflake customer data. There’s no evidence to suggest anyone purchased the set. At one point, the hacker made a mistake by posting a video that revealed some technical infrastructure, which Mandiant, a cyber unit of Google Cloud, used to help identify them, Larsen said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google begins its defense in antitrust case alleging monopoly over advertising technology",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — Google opened its defense against allegations that it holds an illegal monopoly on online advertising technology Friday with witness testimony saying the industry is vastly more complex and competitive than portrayed by the federal government.\n\n“The industry has been exceptionally fluid over the last 18 years,” said Scott Sheffer, a vice president for global partnerships at Google, the company's first witness at its antitrust trial in federal court in Alexandria.\n\nThe Justice Department and a coalition of states contend that Google built and maintained an illegal monopoly over the technology that facilitates the buying and selling of online ads seen by consumers.\n\nGoogle counters that the government's case improperly focuses on a narrow type of online ads — essentially the rectangular ones that appear on the top and on the right-hand side of a webpage. In its opening statement, Google’s lawyers said the Supreme Court has warned judges against taking action when dealing with rapidly emerging technology like what Sheffer described because of the risk of error or unintended consequences.\n\nGoogle says defining the market so narrowly ignores the competition it faces from social media companies, Amazon, streaming TV providers and others who offer advertisers the means to reach online consumers.\n\nJustice Department lawyers called witnesses to testify for two weeks before resting their case Friday afternoon, detailing the ways that automated ad exchanges conduct auctions in a matter of milliseconds to determine which ads are placed in front of which consumers and how much they cost.\n\nThe department contends the auctions are finessed in subtle ways that benefit Google to the exclusion of would-be competitors and in ways that prevent publishers from making as much money as they otherwise could for selling their ad space.\n\nIt also says that Google's technology, when used on all facets of an ad transaction, allows Google to keep 36 cents on the dollar of any particular ad purchase, billions of which occur every single day.\n\nExecutives at media companies like Gannett, which publishes USA Today, and News Corp., which owns the Wall Streel Journal and Fox News, have said that Google dominates the landscape with technology used by publishers to sell ad space as well as by advertisers looking to buy it. The products are tied together so publishers have to use Google's technology if they want easy access to its large cache of advertisers.\n\nThe government said in its complaint filed last year that at a minimum Google should be forced to sell off the portion of its business that caters to publishers, to break up its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his testimony Friday, Sheffer explained how Google's tools have evolved over the years and how it vetted publishers and advertisers to guard against issues like malware and fraud.\n\nThe trial began Sept. 9, just a month after a judge in the District of Columbia declared Google’s core business, its ubiquitous search engine, an illegal monopoly. That trial is still ongoing to determine what remedies, if any, the judge may impose.\n\nThe ad technology at question in the Virginia case does not generate the same kind of revenue for Goggle as its search engine does, but is still believed to bring in tens of billions of dollars annually.\n\nOverseas, regulators have also accused Google of anticompetitive conduct. But the company won a victory this week when a an EU court overturned a 1.49 billion euro ($1.66 billion) antitrust fine imposed five years ago that targeted a different segment of the company's online advertising business.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Google Allegedly Monopolized the Ad Technology Market",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google has monopolized the technology used to buy and sell online display ads by restricting or eliminating the choices of its customers — both website publishers and advertisers — the US Justice Department alleged at a federal antitrust trial.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nAntitrust enforcers have sought to illustrate how the Alphabet Inc. unit’s complex ad ecosystem works and the ways in which the company allegedly manipulated the features of its products and the rules of its auctions to its own benefit. Over the last two weeks at the Virginia trial, they accused Google of abusing its market power in three areas: sell-side tools used by websites, called ad servers; advertising exchanges; and buy-side tools used by advertisers known as ad networks.\n\nWebsite publishers use an ad server to manage space available for sale. The ad server acts as the brain for the website, keeping track of the minimum bids a publisher is willing to accept, what has been sold and for how much. The Justice Department estimates that Google’s ad server controls 87% of the US market and 91% of the market globally.\n\nAd exchanges control the auctions that match website publishers with advertisers. Google operates the largest exchange, known as AdX, later rebranded as Google Ad Manager. The Justice Department estimates that Google’s ad exchange controls 47% of the US market and 56% globally. Other popular ad exchanges include Pubmatic Inc., Index Exchange, and Magnite Inc.\n\nSophisticated advertisers use software known as a demand-side platform to manage their ads and help determine which ad exchanges to bid on and for how much. Google operates a demand-side platform that can bid on an ad exchange.\n\nAdvertisers also use ad networks, which take over most of the decision-making process like where to place ads and what to bid, and are most often used by smaller companies. The Justice Department alleges that Google’s network, Google Ads, controls 88% of the US market and 87% globally.\n\nAntitrust enforcers alleged that Google gave special access and privileges to its own ad products to encourage both advertisers and websites to spend only through its services.\n\nGoogle has argued that the Justice Department’s case misunderstands the dynamics, pace of innovation and competitive landscape within the online advertising market. Advertisers have multiple choices for where to buy ads, the company said, including Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook and Instagram, as well as Amazon.com Inc. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also said that many of the Justice Department’s contentions mischaracterize how the technology operates. Changes to the ad tech platform were intended to improve the product, Google said. The limitations on rivals’ access were in place to reduce spam and ad fraud or help advertisers have better control over where ads appeared, the company said.\n\nTying Products\n\nAs one advertising executive wrote in a 2017 email to her boss: “The value in Google’s ad tech stack is less in each individual product but in the connections across all of them.”\n\nAdvertisers using the Google Ads network are only permitted to place bids through Google’s own exchange, AdX, with a few limited exceptions. That gives AdX a significant volume of ads. In 2020, for example, Google Ads sent in bids for 18 million ads sold through AdX, but only about 3 million to 4 million to third-party exchanges. The tight connection between the products requires any websites that want Google Ads advertising to use AdX.\n\nSimilarly, certain functions of Google’s ad exchange, such as real-time bidding, are only available to publishers that use its ad server, DFP, according to the Justice Department.\n\n“Customers are essentially forced to use DFP to get access to AdX,” said Rosa Abrantes-Metz, the Justice Department’s economic expert. Likewise “AdX is the only channel to reach Google Ads in full.”\n\nPopular websites testified that they felt compelled to use Google’s ad server product because of its exclusive access to Google Ads.\n\n“I felt like they were holding us hostage,” said Stephanie Layser, formerly a top executive at News Corp. in charge of the media company’s use of advertising technology. Google’s ad server technology, developed decades ago, was “slow and clunky,” she said, but News Corp. estimated it might lose as much as $9 million a year if it moved to a different server because it would lose access to Google Ads.\n\nCompanies that work with advertisers said they had to use Google’s ad exchange, even though it charges higher fees than others, to ensure they had enough access to website inventory.\n\nGoogle has argued that it has no obligation under the law to make its products work with those offered by rivals. The requirement that Google Ads bid almost exclusively through AdX helps the company better manage spam and ad fraud, company employees testified.\n\nIn 2015, Google launched a program called AdWords Bidding that allowed more exchanges to bid on Google’s inventory. But it was limited to ad retargeting campaigns, by which marketers reach out to users who have visited their website in the past.\n\nOpening up the platform to allow more exchanges to bid on Google’s inventory required a huge lift from the company’s internal engineering teams to work through others’ problems with quality, testified Nirmal Jayaram, a Google engineer who worked on the company’s advertising tools for marketers.\n\nFirst Look\n\nBefore 2015, online display ads were sold using a “waterfall” method. A website’s ad server would ask each advertising exchange for bids sequentially. If the first exchange had an advertiser willing to pay a website’s minimum bid, the process ended. Subsequent exchanges only got to bid if the first one didn’t want a particular ad impression, even if they would have been willing to pay more.\n\nThe majority of websites used Google’s ad server, which would automatically call on Google’s ad exchange to bid first, according to the Justice Department. That advantage allowed Google to win most often. Even websites that used a different ad server tended to seek out Google’s exchange first because of its exclusive access to advertisers using Google Ads.\n\nFacebook’s Brian Boland, who helmed the social network’s ad tech tools for a decade, likened this to Google getting to pick the best apples out of a crate before any other exchange.\n\nGoogle was aware of its advantage. “It’s strategic for us to have the AdServer being the decision maker to ensure” Google’s advertiser product “has first look access,” Eisar Lipkovitz, who headed the company’s display ad business from 2014 to 2019, wrote in an email exchange with other Google colleagues.\n\nGabriel Weintraub, an expert who testified for the Justice Department, estimated that Google’s first look decreased the share of bids that rival exchanges saw by about 25%.\n\nGoogle said the DOJ’s descriptions of how the ad server worked mischaracterize the technology and that it was technically possible for websites to move another exchange in front of Google’s AdX in the waterfall. Few publishers used this technique, the company said, because they wanted to seek bids from the advertisers who had already chosen to work with Google.\n\nAdMeld Acquisition\n\nIn 2010, Google became worried about competitors known as yield management systems, which helped websites analyze historical ad performance and determine what order to seek bids from the different ad exchanges. In an internal presentation, Google employees said that the rival tools prevented Google’s advertising exchange from seeing all of the available publisher inventory.\n\nAt the time, some publishers were more comfortable with these tools because they still hadn’t wrapped their heads around some of the new features Google was offering, including real-time bidding, according to Neal Mohan, a leader in Google’s display advertising business who later became chief executive officer at YouTube. Mohan likened yield managers to DVDs in a world with modern-day video streaming, framing the tools as outdated tech.\n\nBut because publishers still used them, Google was interested in acquiring a company that made them. According to documents shown in court, in 2008, Mohan suggested “picking up the one with the most traction and parking it somewhere.”\n\nGoogle eventually decided to buy a leading yield manager, AdMeld, for more than $400 million in 2011. The search giant incorporated some of AdMeld’s technology into its own ad exchange, and then shut down the service in 2013.\n\nLast Look\n\nDOJ expert Abrantes-Metz said Google’s purchase of AdMeld was a classic “killer acquisition” — buying a potential rival and deprecating the features that threatened its own product.\n\nBy 2015, websites had become frustrated with Google and started using an alternate technology, known as header bidding, which moved the bidding process outside of the ad server. With header bidding, a publisher would add code to the website so that an auction would take place within the browser as a page was loading. This allowed websites to simultaneously seek bids from all exchanges and pick the one that would pay the most.\n\nAfter the auction had ended, the website would send the information to the ad server. Because Google’s ad server is tied into its exchange, though, the company had an opportunity to decide whether it wanted to preempt the winner and take the ad for itself. Lawyers for the Justice Department argued that this allowed Google to win ads without having to directly compete against other exchanges. The informational advantage also allowed Google to adjust its own bids downward since it had more data on the highest bids coming from other exchanges, the DOJ said.\n\nAbrantes-Metz, the Justice Department expert, likened it to having other exchanges take part in a sealed bid auction, but letting Google open the envelope at the end.\n\nGoogle acknowledged this advantage in its internal documents. Google’s tools “have visibility in to remnant price before they submit bids (commonly referred to in the market as ‘last look’),” one presentation said. But the company’s lawyers also argued that rival ad exchanges could have built integrations with its ad server that they chose not to do because it was costly.\n\n“Both publishers and exchanges have very strongly complained about the fairness of” last look, another Google employee wrote in a 2016 email.\n\nWeintraub estimated that Google’s last look advantage increased the amount of ad spend on its platform by $473 million a year.\n\nGoogle argues that websites could avoid giving its exchange a last look, but that most publishers opted to allow it to bid because of the greater demand in Google Ads. The company also said that when Google’s exchange gained a “last look,” that led to higher revenue for publishers.\n\nRevenue Share\n\nGoogle’s advertising exchange, AdX, charges a 20% fee on winning bids. But in 2014, Google introduced a mechanism, called Dynamic Revenue Share, that would allow AdX to vary the fee if that would help an advertiser to win. The system would keep track of when it had given an advertiser a discounted fee on a particular bid and make up the difference in a later auction.\n\nThe search giant was only able to implement DRS because of its last look advantage, Weintraub said, since Google knew what price it needed to beat in order to win. He estimated that it increased ad spending on Google’s exchange by about $162 million a year.\n\n“Because they could see all the bids, they could adjust the rev share at the end,” Brian O’Kelley, the former CEO of AppNexus, a rival ad exchange that was later purchased by AT&T and then Microsoft Corp. “Because they were at the end of the process, because they owned the ad server, they could win that impression.”\n\nGoogle argues that the mechanism helped publishers because they made more money from their ad inventory. In one 2019 experiment the company conducted internally, it found that the DRS led to an increase of as much as 4% in publisher revenue.\n\nPricing Rules\n\nAfter the introduction of header bidding, Google discovered that websites would often give AdX a higher minimum price to compensate for its last look advantage.\n\nIn 2019, Google introduced Unified Pricing Rules, which eliminated the ability of websites to give Google’s exchange a higher minimum price than other exchanges.\n\nWebsite publishers were very unhappy with the change. At an April 2019 meeting with top publishers where Google announced the new rules, several websites expressed concern that Google was eliminating a key tool they used to control how exchanges bid on ads.\n\nThe new rules “stopped our ability to set floors as we would like,” Michael Wheatland, an executive with the UK’s Daily Mail newspaper, testified. After the rules were adopted, the newspaper saw three times as much of its ad inventory sold through AdX, he said.\n\nThe new rules hurt publishers by limiting their ability to distinguish between different exchanges, DOJ expert Weintraub said. He estimated the rules pushed as much as $221 million in advertising spend each year to AdX.\n\nGoogle disputes Weintraub’s assessment of the impact of the rules, attributing them to a separate change in bidding order.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Faces EU Ultimatum in Fresh Attack on Search Dominance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is set to be hit by another attack from European Union watchdogs, paving the way for a hefty fine and an order to change its business model unless the US giant takes rapid action to give more prominence to rivals across its sprawling search empire.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways Belfast’s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland’s Public Transport\n\nEU officials are preparing a formal chargesheet against the Alphabet Inc. unit under the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, targeting how the company displays rival product results across its different search services, such as Google Flights and Google Hotels. The company could face hefty penalties of up to 10% of global annual revenue if its fails to step into line with the rules.\n\nThe EU’s preliminary findings could be issued before the end of October, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke under condition of anonymity. The people added that the timing could slip with the upcoming changeover of top level officials at the European Commission, and Google still has some time to offset the EU authority’s concerns. A final decision in the case is due to come before the end of March next year.\n\nGoogle’s lawyers met with EU commission officials behind closed doors this week in a bid to ease the watchdog’s concerns over compliance with the rules. One proposal floated by the firm includes introducing a new design into Google’s search tabs, that would give users the option of navigating to alternative search platforms or direct suppliers such as hotel websites and airlines, according to other people familiar with the matter.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the firm has tried to balance the needs of different types of websites, while still respecting users’ choice. The commission in Brussels declined to comment.\n\nThe EU’s landmark DMA lays out a series of dos and don’ts for some of the world’s largest tech platforms. The upcoming warning comes on the heels of a major court win for the commission against abusive behavior on Google Search. Last week, the Mountain View, California company lost its court bid to topple a once-record €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion) fine over EU allegations that it had abused its monopoly power to crush rival shopping services. This week, the company had better success, managing to overturn a €1.5 billion EU fine for thwarting competition for online ads, in a dispute over behavior that the firm says finished in 2016.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shopping case was one of four that have marked the centerpiece of EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager’s efforts to crack down on the growing power of big tech companies. She’s fined Google more than €8 billion to date and has also echoed the US Department of Justice’s suggestion that Google’s advertising technology business should be broken up. Vestager is coming to the end of her decade-long stint at the EU and is soon to be replaced by Spain’s Teresa Ribera.\n\nGoogle is set to join Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. in facing formal DMA complaints. The bloc first hit out at Apple’s app stores rules in June, and then issued a warning about Meta’s subscription model for ad-free services on Instagram and Facebook. Just this week, Apple was pressed to make changes to its iPhone operating system in order to step into line with the rules.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Xbox’s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 161% in five years. It's even up 4.8% in the last week. But this might be partly because the broader market had a good week last week, gaining 2.6%.\n\nSince it's been a strong week for Alphabet shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 21% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nAlphabet provided a TSR of 25% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 21% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. Before forming an opinion on Alphabet you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc (GOOG): Best Forever Stock To Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\n\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\n\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\n\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\n\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\n\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\n\nSoucre: pexels\n\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\n\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\n\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\n\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\n\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors. We analyzed the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, focusing on high-quality US stocks with strong competitive advantages. We ranked the top 10 based on market cap and hedge fund holdings.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 165\n\nMarket Cap as of September 18, 2024: $1.97 Trillion\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a tech giant that operates through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. It provides products and services, including ads, Android, Chrome, Search, and YouTube.\n\nAlphabet is one of the best forever stocks to buy now as its cloud business is in a phase of robust growth, given that the cloud market is nascent. The enhancement of cloud solutions with AI is increasingly strengthening their competitive edge. Cloud revenues in the second quarter rose to $10.3 billion from $8 billion a year ago.\n\nThe company dominates the search world and has been integrating artificial intelligence features to enhance user experience. Likewise, the search business remains the company’s core, generating billions of dollars in advertising revenues.\n\nDuring the second quarter, total revenues were up 14% to $84.74 billion as YouTube earned $8.7 billion from advertising alone, marking a 13% increase compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, Google Cloud experienced a significant rise in earnings, growing by 29% to surpass $10 billion in the same timeframe, illustrating the company’s rapid expansion.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which may provide a degree of financial stability. In the second quarter, it generated $23.6 billion in net income and $18.37 million as of last year’s same quarter.\n\nBacked by a solid balance sheet with significant free cash flow, Alphabet has already started returning value to shareholders through dividend payments. The company has already confirmed a $0.20 dividend with a yield of 0.50%. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) looks incredibly cheap while trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 18.\n\nA total of 165 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the second quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Inside Google Ventures’ first 15 years — and its plans for the next 300",
        "content": "One of the first things David Krane and I do is look at some weird sculptures.\n\nWalking through Google’s Mountain View, Calif. campus, he joyfully shows me the famous Android lawn statues — the Android robot shaped like a Kit Kat, the Android robot stuck in a honeycomb, and an Android robot holding the largest lollipop I’ve ever seen, sculptural or otherwise.\n\nKrane, the CEO and managing partner of Google Ventures (GV), has spent much of his life on this campus, amid the sprawling collection of statues (which are based on the dessert names of various versions of Android software). It’s a surreal sight of impossibly-sized candy and whimsical color. I didn’t ask Krane if the sculptures were edible, but I wish I had, just to see his reaction, because it’s all very Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nIf the candy surroundings evoke the famous fantasyland, Google Ventures, and its only LP Alphabet, occupy a role within the startup scene that’s not so dissimilar from Willy Wonka’s factory. Many of the tech industry’s most important products were dreamed up over here. And while there’s no such thing as a golden ticket in the startup game, for founders hoping to break into the tech business, earning a spot in GV’s portfolio can feel pretty close.\n\nKrane (who shares the same fast-paced patter and light tenor as Gene Wilder’s Wonka, though he didn’t do a somersault when I met him) has been at GV for 15 years now, building what began as an unusual project at the internet search giant. Incorporated on Sept. 1, 2009, GV was launched in the thick of the Great Financial Crisis, when the global economy was teetering, businesses were collapsing, and techies were clinging to their jobs rather than launching risky startups.\n\nIn the years since then, GV has struck deals with some of tech’s most game-changing businesses, including Uber and Stripe, and defined itself within Silicon Valley’s storied, and competitive, venture industry. From the beginning, Krane and GV have been encouraged to think in hundred-year time horizons — a blessing when compared to the finite time frames to return capital that other VCs operate under, but a framework that can impose its own burdens.\n\nNow, as the tech industry undergoes another major shift with the advent of generative AI, GV is looking for the unconventional, long-term answers that can continue to set it apart.\n\n“Explain something technical to me that I don’t already understand”\n\nKrane is in some ways an unlikely leader of one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful venture firms. In 2000, Krane became Google employee number 84 overseeing the nascent company’s communications and public relations efforts — a job he landed thanks to some quick thinking.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring Krane’s interview, Google cofounder Sergey Brin had only one question for him: “Explain something technical to me that I don't already understand.”\n\n“I took a nice breath in, and I started explaining to him how to make a reed for a clarinet,” recalls Krane. “If you use these tools and actions to sand a reed, file a reed shape, and attach it to a clarinet, you can make a beautiful sound come out the end of the clarinet,” he explained.\n\nBrin was impressed, Krane says. “I spoke about it very precisely, from a technical perspective. I spoke about it from an outcome and impact perspective. It’s not easy, so I presented a hard problem to him — not anybody could walk up off the street, do that first pass with a reed, and make a clarinet sound beautiful.”\n\nNearly a decade later, the birth of GV occurred in a similarly unexpected moment.\n\nBrin and Larry Page, Google’s other cofounder, pulled Krane aside at a Silicon Valley charity event one day. The two founders were pursuing several new ideas at the time, and one of them was a relatively vague idea for a VC firm somehow linked to Google. Krane was initially a little surprised, thinking he wasn’t the on-paper obvious person to go to — but he had worked on a lot of deals.\n\n\"Larry and Sergey reminded me that I was always the champion for these founders that we had acquired — that I would come into management meetings and advocate for them,” he said. “I’d say things like: ‘Guys, these founders, we bought their company two weeks ago, they’re not being properly treated and they’re already unhappy. They’re questioning, did I make the right decision?’ So, they said that I really have an affinity for that sort of founder view. ‘We’re thinking about forming a venture entity. Would you like to help us assess that opportunity, and design it?’”\n\nKrane was “unequivocally in,” he says 15 years later. From there, a few key decisions were made. The plan was to structure GV as an independent venture firm, rather than a strategic corporate venture arm — this would model GV like the top firms on Sand Hill Road, allowing GV to make independent decisions and focus on financial returns, rather than strategic alignment.\n\nKleiner Perkins’ John Doerr was an early advisor, and those initial days involved asking Doerr (an early Google investor) lots of questions. But mostly, those first days of GV were a small team \"loosely organized in a set of desks in just a random building on this campus a couple blocks from [where the GV office is today].\" On that very first day, the new, scrappy GV team was in a cluster of desks near other Google curiosities, including what would become Google X and projects like Google Glass and Waymo.\n\nKrishna Yeshwant, GV managing partner, was there on Day One. The thoughtful son of Chicago doctors, he’d rebelliously studied computer science and founded two tech companies, later going to medical school. Yeshwant turned up at Google in 2008 — just in time to take an almost impossible-to-explain gamble.\n\n“In 2009, it really didn’t feel like it was going to work,” said Yeshwant, who I met in GV’s secret-door conference room. “My parents back then were definitely like, what? You did all this medicine?... I think they thought it seemed like a good side project. It wasn’t obvious and felt like a real risk in 2009, 10 and 11. It wasn’t clear whether this was going to go well or not.”\n\nSo, everyone hunkered in and tried to do some deals, and Krane thought about the conversation he had with Brin back when he was joining Google: \"There wasn't a company in the Valley that was thinking about a 300-year arc before you can measure: Are we even any good at what we're doing?”\n\nAlphabet and independence\n\nThat 300-year time horizon is an important touchpoint for understanding GV, which isn’t immune to the normal ten-year venture cycle — but isn’t beholden to it either. GV isn’t a corporate venture firm, or CVC, in that it doesn’t invest off the balance sheet. And while Google wants to see capital returned, it’s flexible on the time frame. Though a GV portfolio company has occasionally been acquired by Google, that’s a rare occurrence, and not part of the mission of GV’s investments.\n\nWhile GV is physically close to Google, it operates independently from the internet search company and is classified as one of Alphabet’s “Other Bets.”\n\nThere’s no red phone Krane picks up, where someone on the other end says, “Office of the LP!”\n\nThe firm has doubled the amount of capital it manages — GV had $5 billion in assets under management in 2019, and has more than $10 billion today. During the pandemic, GV expanded its team by 20%, over 15 new investment hires since 2019.  It began expanding beyond early-stage to include more growth-stage deals. GV has announced an average of 50 new portfolio companies every year since 2020 and has so far revealed more than 30 new companies in 2024. GV deploys about $1 billion annually in new and follow-on investments.\n\nAs one source familiar with the mechanics explained to me: There’s a committee, which includes seasoned VCs like Doerr, that has visibility into GV's capital plans, holdings, and key metrics. While there's an Alphabet board committee that keeps an eye on GV, the committee is ready to jump into any discussions when needed. Once a year, GV gives the board a heads-up on its capital deployment forecast for the upcoming year.\n\nCathy Friedman, who headed the biotech practice at Morgan Stanley for years and served as a director on several public company boards, says the unusual relationship with Google was hard to wrap her head around at first when she joined GV in 2021.\n\n“I honestly did not know what it would be like, because I kept thinking about Cisco and Intel, and that was kind of the model I had seen of corporate venture capital — and that’s definitely not this,” said Friedman.\n\nSigning (and driving) Travis Kalanick\n\nOne of GV’s early wins came in 2011 with Nest, investing tens of millions in the smart home product pioneer. The deal proved to be a “breakout moment,” and not just because the outcome was a 2014 $3.2 billion sale to Google. It was early evidence that GV could attract non-Google talent. (Nest cofounder Matt Rogers later founded the waste prevention startup Mill, which GV also backs today.)\n\n“The founders of Nest came from Apple,” said Krane. “There was absolutely no reason why a team from Apple should embrace anybody from Google.”\n\nBut it was Uber that perhaps became the firm’s most colorful early success. After chasing Uber CEO and cofounder Travis Kalanick for two years, Krane finally pinned him down to talk about the rideshare company’s Series C — and Kalanick quickly threw a curveball.\n\n“I knew he was going to raise a lot of money in that round,” said Krane. “What I didn't know initially and what he had decided, probably based on interest, was that he was going to raise that from a single entity — not from a syndicate of investors.\"\n\nThis presented some good news, namely that the potential upside was even higher than Krane could have ever guessed. But it was mostly neutral-to-bad news: To make Uber happen GV would have to “scare up more capital” (as Krane put it) and would have to win a game of winner-take-all, soundly beating out far more established players. So, GV and Krane asked: What can we do that no one else can?\n\nThe answer was cinematic enough to make it into Mike Isaac’s 2019 book Super Pumped: The Battle of Uber. As they were trying to close the deal, GV put Kalanick up in the Four Seasons Hotel in Palo Alto. The morning of the meeting, as Kalanick waited in front of the hotel for a car, Krane also showed up.\n\n“I saw him make a connection with his Uber black car that he had ordered,” said Krane. “He opened the door, threw his backpack in the back, and then I popped up and said: ‘Hey Travis!’ He was surprised, ‘What are you doing here?’ I said, ‘Yeah, you’re not going to the meeting in that car. You’re going to go in this car.’ And I had a Waymo autonomous car waiting with a driver…. I didn't even ride with him. I just put him in the car, got out of the way.”\n\nWell, how did he react?\n\n“I mean, head-explodes-off-shoulder,” Krane laughs.\n\nWhatever happened next, this much seems to be true: For Kalanick, it was pure imagination. He signed on the dotted line.\n\nKalanick, who resigned from Uber amid controversies over the company’s culture, is a slightly touchy subject these days, and Krane is careful in how he talks about him. Krane still has an ice-blue statue depicting Uber’s fastest-growing markets in his office that Kalanick gave him and other board members, though I expect it’s not so much about Kalanick, but what Uber ultimately meant for GV.\n\nIn 2013, Krane told me that GV invested $335 million in Uber. In 2019, when the company went public, GV’s stake was worth over $2 billion, according to the rideshare company’s IPO filing. (GV sold its shares post-IPO.)\n\nIt was then — and still is — GV’s largest-ever investment. (GV’s second-largest-ever investment is Cribl, for which the firm led the startup’s Series E this summer. You can read more about here.)\n\nAI, healthcare, and the long game\n\nAs GV looks for the next Ubers, the changing tech landscape is top of mind. And that’s putting more focus on the fundamental questions about GV.\n\nDave Munichiello and Tom Hulme co-lead the firm’s digital investing team. I asked them both: Is GV contrarian? Munichiello doesn’t see GV as expressly contrarian, while Hulme does. But they each go on to describe a future of GV that is in some ways unexpected.\n\n“We’re not investing in foundation models,” said Munichiello. “There will be other chapters of AI, but this isn’t the one we’re going to jump into. We’re going to stay at the application layer and at infrastructure.” (GV, as you may expect, has long invested in AI and its portfolio currently includes Snorkel, SambaNova, and Modular.)\n\nGoogle, of course, has its own very capable AI home-grown foundation models, and the company has invested $2 billion in LLM-maker Anthropic. But GV isn’t attached to Google’s plans, the firm says.\n\n\"It sounds really grandiose, but one of the things I love about our role is we’re not limited by sector,” said Hulme. “We have the ability to invest in anything… and we have the structure that enables us to adapt.\"\n\nGV also sees its future in its life sciences practice, a sector in which the firm rang up another big  early win with Flatiron Health, the oncology data startup acquired by Roche for $1.9 billion in 2018. Flatiron’s cofounders didn’t come from medicine, but were able to develop effective startups in the space with tech know-how.\n\n\"Flatiron was an inspiration for that type,” said Yeshwant. “It was kind of a novel way to succeed.\"\n\nIn GV’s next 15 years, Yeshwant wants to really emphasize moving the line on what success can mean, beyond financial returns. He’s thinking about it in terms of improving care delivery, and using diseases cured as a metric.\n\n“It happens so rarely, but when you can cure disease, it may be the only really transformative thing that happens in healthcare,” said Yeshwant.\n\nIs a more flexible time horizon essential for these kinds of pursuits?\n\n\"There's no question,” said David Schenkein, GV general partner, a hematologist, medical oncologist and former CEO of Agios Pharmaceuticals. “I feel it all the time. The kind of companies I'm interested in are going to take longer to mature than many venture funds can tolerate.\"\n\nPure imagination\n\nKrane played both the clarinet and the saxophone as a kid (he actually sat next to Larry Page in bandcamp). As we jaywalked on the Googleplex, I asked what his favorite song to play on the sax was.\n\n\"My favorite song to play, 'In the Mood,' is a very simple standard,” he said. “What it opened for me was an opportunity to improvise and just have no limits.\"\n\nThat’s more or less what’s happened with GV these last 15 years. It started with the idea of a corporate VC firm that wasn’t and ended up with something that exists on its own wavelength.\n\nVenture at its best is able to support founders in making the impossible possible. But that means you have to believe in the impossible in the first place, in pure imagination. And for all the ways in which GV is independent of Google, that ethos is something that’s in GV’s DNA.\n\nKrane told me that in Google’s early days, Brin and Page were obsessed with the idea of building a space elevator that could move people from Earth to the moon, and back again. They even taped on an office wall a crowd-sourcing call to Googlers.\n\n“It had an incomplete, crude start of a schematic about how one might go about building a space elevator,” said Krane. “Then, it had a companion call-out on this big piece of butcher paper that said: ‘Finish this.’” Of course, that’s crazy – but it’s the kind of moonshot faith that empowers GV to this day. It’s what allows GV to, in a phrase that Krane taught me, “press the believe button.”\n\nIn the last scene of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka asks Charlie to start the glass elevator.\n\n“There it goes,” Wilder says. “Hold on tight. I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. Faster, faster . . . If we don't pick up enough speed, we'll never get through.”\n\nThere’s a moment before the elevator makes impact with the ceiling, where it’s unclear what’s going to happen. Whether they will crash to their deaths, or whether Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe will rise to heights that were previously unimaginable.\n\nFor those who can find glee in this, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI? New jobs? California's local news deal with Google leaves lots of unanswered questions",
        "content": "Early this summer, California seemed poised to play a leading role in shaping a new frontier of tech regulation as lawmakers considered bills to force big digital platforms to pay local news.\n\nThe legislation, which would have been a first in the United States, advanced in Sacramento as newspapers struggle with precipitous decline and Google battles in federal court over claims that it violated antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly on web searches.\n\nBut over a few weeks in August the push for legislation fell apart.\n\nGoogle lobbied hard against the California Journalism Preservation Act, which would compensate news outlets for articles that show up in search results. Division among news outlets was rife as some smaller publishers feared it would disproportionately benefit big legacy publications. And Gov. Gavin Newsom had made no public commitment to signing a bill. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, shown this month, may require companies to spend the journalism funding on new hires, a position many publishers probably will resist. (Matt Slocum / Associated Press)\n\nNow, weeks after Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) dropped the legislation in favor of a nonbinding agreement between Google and the state, numerous questions remain unanswered about how it will work.\n\nA bare-bones framework of an agreement, sketched out on a single sheet of paper, the deal promises $125 million for a journalism fund that will be parceled out to local newsrooms over five years.\n\nBut nothing stops Google from walking away from its commitment to $55 million. State funding of $70 million depends on approval from legislators and Newsom, and the governor may require companies to spend the money on new hires, a position many publishers probably will resist. UC Berkeley is supposed to administer the fund, but its leaders want more assurance from the state that the fund will transform local news — and a stake in how it is run.\n\nMeanwhile, publishers are pushing for more journalistic oversight of an additional part of the deal — Google's $62-million payment for a new but ill-defined “AI accelerator\" — arguing that it could result in job losses if tech controls the board.\n\nSome journalists and publishers say the deal is better than nothing. But many are disappointed that California — a state that prides itself on passing innovative, progressive laws — ultimately bailed on taking on Big Tech. Google lobbied against the California Journalism Preservation Act, which would have required it to compensate news outlets for articles that show up in search results. (Jeff Chiu / Associated Press)\n\nA few said they miscalculated the challenge of fighting digital giants — particularly in a state where tech corporations hold significant sway in government and have contributed millions of dollars to the governor’s causes. Google's ties with Newsom go back some 20 years to his days as San Francisco mayor, when he made headlines for flying from Switzerland with Google's founders in a chartered jet.\n\n“It was very hard to pass this legislation in Google’s backyard,” said Julie Makinen, chair of the California News Publishers Assn., the bill's lead sponsor. “We grossly underestimated the political complexity of that in a state where Google is the homegrown wonder child that has a lot of influence and is very close to the governor.”\n\nRobert Salladay, Newsom’s senior advisor of communications, pushed back, saying the governor had worked to strike a balance between imposing regulations and encouraging innovation.\n\n“This is a compromise,\" Salladay said. \"The governor is part of and approved a deal that will benefit the California news industry by a quarter of a billion dollars. No other state has done anything close to that. How does that mean he’s kowtowing to Google?”\n\nHow the deal came together\n\nOver the last two decades, Silicon Valley has developed wildly successful search and social media sites that have fundamentally disrupted the financial model of journalism. As the new platforms gobbled up digital advertising, the state has lost about two-thirds of its newspaper journalists.\n\nThe problem isn't confined to California. After Australia and Canada crafted deals to get tech to pay news outlets, Wicks looked to Canada as a model for her legislation.\n\nWicks knew it was going to be tough to take on Big Tech on its home turf. But she said she was caught by surprise by two other factors: Google's preexisting agreements to pay certain publishers, and divisions her proposal stoked within the journalism industry. California Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), said: \"My goal was to get resources into the hands of publications as quickly as we could, because publications are literally dying right now.\" (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press)\n\nWicks joined forces with state Sen. Steve Glazer (D-Orinda) on a separate bill that would impose a data-mining fee on tech companies, forcing them to pay $500 million a year. In June, both bills advanced in the Capitol.\n\nAround the same time, Wicks spotted red flags in Canada. A year after the government there forced Google to pay $74 million a year, publishers had yet to receive the money. Some complained they were no better off, or in a worse position, after Google canceled preexisting financial deals and Meta stopped distributing news on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nRead more:California is trying to force Big Tech to pay for news. What can we learn from Australia and Canada?\n\nWicks soon came to see both California bills as precarious — unlikely to reach Newsom's desk or be signed into law. Even if Newsom signed, the bill would face years of litigation at a time when many publishers faced dwindling funds and imminent layoffs. So she began negotiating with Google.\n\n“My goal was to get resources into the hands of publications as quickly as we could, because publications are literally dying right now,\" Wicks said.\n\nAccording to interviews with 20 legislators, Capitol staffers, publishers, lobbyists, union leaders, journalism experts and trade group leaders — some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships — there was bitter disagreement on the path forward. Google declined to speak on the record.\n\nNewsom was silent in April when Google protested AB 886 by removing links to California news sites — a sharp contrast to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had slammed Google for \"bullying tactics” in his country.\n\nThe governor wondered why the state should force Big Tech to bail out some of the state’s biggest news owners.\n\nAs Wicks moved to negotiate a deal, she said she hoped California could secure an amount on par with the $74 million a year Google agreed to pay Canada, a country with a similar population and smaller economy.\n\nWicks called on former Sen. Bob Hertzberg, a onetime California Assembly speaker known for forging landmark deals on school bonds and access to Colorado River water, to lead discussions with Google and Newsom’s office.\n\nAn intense negotiator, Hertzberg called and Zoomed with newspaper lobbyists and media executives, who explained the dire state of their industry and said they needed money soon to avert layoffs.\n\nHe met with a team of Google lobbyists and executives who insisted that the state pitch in, along with other Big Tech companies. Google pushed back on the idea that it should pay as much in California as Canada, Hertzberg said. It said a fair figure would consider that it is already paying $10 million a year to local California outletseven though it terminated that spending in Canada. Plus, Canada’s deal includes payments to national outlets, but California’s bill focused solely on local news. Last year, Google agreed to pay $100 million over three years to the New York Times, whose second-biggest market is California. (Eric Baradat / Getty Images)\n\nNational outlets such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have a large chunk of readers in California, and Google already is compensating them. Last year, Google agreed to pay $100 million over three years to the New York Times, whose second-biggest market is California.\n\nIn her bill, Wicks said local news sustains civic society and provides a far deeper level of California reporting than national outlets. But Hertzberg did not dwell on such concerns.\n\n“What became clear from our many hours of discussions is that the vast majority of news read by Californians online is from national newspapers, and not local California publishers,” Hertzberg said. “The various platforms can have their own relationships with those publishers — our focus was on isolating support for local California publishers, which we did.”\n\nRead more:This California city lost its daily newspapers. It faces a crisis over what comes next\n\nA role for AI?\n\nWith the bill dead, fierce divisions emerged over the amount of money Google would pay, the makeup of the board that would administer funds and the lack of journalistic oversight over the AI portion.\n\nThe California News Publishers Assn. pushed back against the idea of Google paying $62 million into an “AI accelerator” program managed by a nonprofit “under terms to be defined by founders.” A separate $5 million would go to an AI fund for journalism.\n\nMakinen, former editor in chief of the San Francisco Standard, urged Wicks to increase the journalism portion of the AI fund to 50% and make sure it was administered by an independent entity.\n\nMakinen believes AI could be a powerful tool to help reporters sort through meeting recordings or identify misinformation. But she said Big Tech was way ahead and publishers urgently needed AI tools to compete.\n\n“The time to reset this is now,” Makinen wrote to Wicks, “while the ink on this document is not yet dry and the story of how AI killed journalism is not set in stone.”\n\nBut the draft framework did not change.\n\nAlicia Ramirez, publisher of the Riverside Record, a tiny nonprofit digital newsroom that covers Riverside County, was shocked to read that the state would pay $70 million into the journalism fund. A heck of a lot of taxpayer money, she thought, for something supposed to hold big tech accountable. In Canada, a year after the government there forced Google to pay $74 million a year, publishers had yet to receive the money. Google canceled preexisting financial deals and Meta stopped distributing news on Facebook and Instagram. (Jeff Chiu / Associated Press)\n\nRamirez was irked that Local Independent Online News Publishers, a trade association that partnered with Google to create Startups Lab, was asking small publishers to write to Wicks’ office to support the deal.\n\nRamirez did write to Wicks’ office — to register her opposition.\n\n“This is simply not enough,” she wrote. “I urge you to go back to the drawing board.”\n\nGlazer, who had worked with Wicks to advance legislation, came out against the deal: “a 2% solution,\" he said, \"is not going to pull independent news out of their death spiral.”\n\nRebuild Local News, a nonprofit coalition, estimates the total settlement — including the amounts paid by the state — would result in about $5,000 to 8,000 a year per California journalist, compared with about $30,000 in Canada.\n\nRestoring the state’s news industry, the group calculates, would cost $125 million a year — about 0.625% of Google, Meta, and Amazon’s combined $20 billion in ad revenues last year in California.\n\nRead more:California’s news industry is shrinking while misinformation spreads. Here's what the numbers tell us\n\nThe fights ahead\n\nWhen the deal was finally announced Aug. 21, Newsom hailed it as “a major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms” — one that would “support hundreds of new journalists.”\n\nYet nothing in the framework requires hiring new journalists. If that becomes a requirement, it's not clear how newsroom managers facing massive deficits would retain existing journalists. \"The Governor would prefer the money go toward rebuilding the industry,\" Salladay said, \"not maintaining the status quo.\"\n\nAnother uncertainty surrounds UC Berkeley's role.\n\nGeeta Anand, the dean of UC Berkeley's graduate journalism school until she went on leave earlier this month, said UC wanted assurance that the state will continue funding the school's California Local News Fellowship and give it seats on the journalism fund's board.\n\nUltimately, she said UC leaders would take part only if they felt assured that the fund would have a significant effect on California journalism.\n\n“The journalism school would really like to help support a state effort to transform local news,” Anand said. “So much more is needed.... This is truly just a start.”\n\nWicks said she supports state funding for UC Berkeley’s news fellowship and is open to extending an opportunity for the university to join the fund’s governing board. She also said she intends to tighten the parameters of the “AI accelerator” fund to ensure it would “help build tools to help and to augment, not to replicate or replace.”\n\nSome remain dubious.\n\n“There’s nothing in this deal that’s a deal,” said Matt Pearce, president of the Media Guild of the West and a former L.A. Times reporter, noting Google set the terms. “It’s all built on a handshake — a handshake with a monopoly.”\n\nThe fight over Big Tech’s role in the decline of local news will continue next year in Sacramento: After Newsom presents his budget in January, advocates will pack hearings again as legislators grapple over state funding.\n\nBeyond California, the battle will shift to Illinois and other states and a broader federal move to regulate Big Tech.\n\n“This is the beginning,\" Wicks said. \"Not the end.”\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

        "title": "Nvidia, AMD stocks lead tech rally after Fed rate cut",
        "content": "AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led the tech stock rally Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s sizable, 50 basis point interest rate cut. Nvidia stock jumped more than 5% while its rival Advanced Micro Devices saw shares rise as much as 7% in afternoon trading.\n\nThe rising stock prices illustrate that investors are absorbing — and believing — Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s message that the US economy is “in good shape.” The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the stock market’s upward trajectory. The index was up 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.8% and the Dow (^DJI) climbed 1.3%.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven big tech stocks all posted gains. Meta (META) stock rose 4%; Apple (AAPL) jumped 3.7%. Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) all bumped up nearly 2%. But the semiconductor subsector of the tech industry was a top gainer. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) climbed nearly 5%.\n\nNvidia’s climb is welcome news to investors who watched the stock’s rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. The chipmaker's shares fell after the company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings at the end of August, beating Wall Street’s expectations but lowering its projected gross margin for the full year.\n\nThe stock tumbled further upon news that the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia as the agency ramped up its antitrust investigation of the company. But it jumped again after CEO Jensen Huang successfully pitched investors on AI’s return on investment during a Goldman Sachs conference last week, and big names like Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and Elon Musk have reportedly “begged” for more Nvidia AI chips.\n\nAnd while Nvidia’s stock price may be down about 12% from three months ago, it’s up a staggering 172% from this time last year. The semiconductor superpower has continued to benefit from the AI boom, which is proving to be more than just hype.\n\nAlthough Nvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, AMD is also a major beneficiary of the AI innovation wave. While the stock has faced ups and downs throughout the last year and has come down from record highs in March, shares are up nearly 55% from last year.\n\nAMD in late June posted second quarter profits up nearly 20% from the prior year. The company will report third quarter results in late October.\n\nThe semiconductor sector’s good day is a bright spot as it faces uncertainty with the US presidential election inching closer. Both presidential candidates’ tough-on-China stances would be bad news for American chip companies like Nvidia. The Biden administration has implemented tough export controls that ban Chinese companies from directly buying chips from Nvidia and AMD in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US introduced further restrictions regarding semiconductor and quantum computing exports earlier this month.

        "title": "At Google antitrust trial, documents say one thing. The tech giant's witnesses say different",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — The judge who will decide whether Google holds a monopoly over technology that matches buyers and sellers of online advertising must choose whether to believe what Google executives wrote or what they have said on the witness stand.\n\nThe Justice Department is wrapping up its antitrust case against Google this week at a federal courtroom in Virginia. The federal government and a coalition of states contend Google has built and maintained a monopoly on the technology used to buy and sell the ads that appear to consumers when they browse the web.\n\nGoogle counters that the government is improperly focused on a very narrow slice of advertising — essentially the rectangular banner ads that appear on the top and along the right side of a publisher's web page — and that within the broader online advertising market, Google is beset on all sides from competition that includes social media companies and streaming TV services.\n\nMany of the government's key witnesses have been Google managers and executives, who have often sought to disavow what they have written in emails, chats and company presentations.\n\nThis was especially true Thursday during the testimony of Jonathan Bellack, a product manager at Google who wrote an email that government lawyers believe is particularly damning.\n\nIn 2016, Bellack wrote an email wondering, \"Is there a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange, and a huge network? The analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE,” the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFor the Justice Department, Bellack's description is almost a perfect summary of its case. It alleges that Google's tech dominates both the market that online publishers use to sell available ad space on their web pages, and the tech used by huge networks of advertisers to buy ad space. Google even dominates the “ad exchanges” that serve as a middleman to match buyer and seller, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nAs a result of Google's dominance in all parts of the transaction, Justice alleges the Mountain View, California-based tech giant has shut out competitors and been able to charge exorbitant fees that amount to 36 cents on the dollar for every ad impression that runs through its stack of ad tech.\n\nOn the stand Thursday, though, Bellack dismissed his email as “late night, jet-lagged ramblings.” He said he didn't think Google's control of the buy side, the sell side and the middleman was an issue, but was speculating why certain customers were looking for workarounds to Google's technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the other current and former Google employees who have testified as government witnesses have similarly rejected their own written words.\n\nEarlier this week, another Google executive, Nirmal Jayaram, spent large parts of his testimony disavowing viewpoints expressed in emails he wrote or articles and presentations he co-authored.\n\nThe Justice Department contends, of course, that what the Google employees wrote in real time is a more accurate reflection of reality. And it says there would be even more damning documentary evidence if Google had not systematically deleted many of the internal chats that employees used to discuss business, even after the company was put on notice that it was under investigation.\n\nTestimony has shown that Google implemented a “Communicate with Care” policy in which employees were instructed to add company lawyers to sensitive emails so they could be marked as “privileged” and exempt from disclosure to government regulators.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema called Google's policies on retention of documents “absolutely inappropriate and improper\" and something she has taken notice of during the trial, though she has not imposed any kind of specific punishment.\n\nThe Virginia trial began Sept. 9, just a month after a judge in the District of Columbia declared Google's core business, its ubiquitous search engine, an illegal monopoly. That trial is still ongoing to determine what remedies, if any, the judge can impose.\n\nThe ad tech at question in the Virginia trial does not generate the same kind of revenue for Goggle as its search engine does, but is still believed to generate tens of billions of dollars of revenue annually.\n\nThe Virginia trial has been moving at a much quicker pace than the D.C. case. The government has presented witnesses for nine days straight and has nearly concluded its case. The judge has told Google it should expect to begin presenting its own witnesses Friday.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If you’re in London this fall and you hear a faint buzzing noise overhead, that may be the sound of one of Google’s Wing drones carrying a load of fresh blood.\n\nThe company just announced that it’s partnering with the U.K.’s National Health Service and medical drone network provider Apian to run a trial that will see drones flying blood samples between two central London hospitals, Guy’s and St Thomas.\n\nBeginning this fall and lasting approximately six months, the trial will focus on transporting time-sensitive blood samples that can’t afford to get stuck in city traffic. As the trial continues, Apian said it could expand to carry other pathology items, medicines and supplies.\n\nMost Read on IEN:\n\nLEGO Tests a Lifesize McLaren Supercar The Fastest and Slowest Selling Vehicles in America Screw Thread Solves 173-Year-Old Mystery Lotus 3-Seater Puts Driver in the Middle\n\nThe Wing drone tapped to make the deliveries is crafted mostly out of foam, weighs around 11 pounds, carries packages weighing about 2 pounds, and will cruise 230 feet above London at about 62 miles per hour. The companies are anticipating no more than 10 flights per day with each flight only taking about two minutes, much shorter than the roughly 30 minutes it takes to drive between the two hospitals.\n\nThe whole operation will be overseen by a certified pilot in command but the drone flights will all be automated and directed to stay within pre-programmed flight paths. Google and Apian have already been granted air space approval by the UK Civil Aviation Authority and the companies expect to conclude all final regulatory requirements before the trial begins later this fall.\n\nThis won’t be the two companies’ first time partnering on medical drone operations. Wing and Apian’s Dublin, Ireland medical supply service have been able to expedite the delivery of sutures and surgical tools.\n\nApian, which was spun out of the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur Program and founded by two doctors along with a former Google Health entrepreneur, has been testing medical drone deliveries in more rural parts of the U.K. But this will be the first time the company will fly its drones over London.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "S&P 500, Dow Jones Hit Record Highs: Magnificent 7 Add $400 Billion After Fed's Historic Interest Rate Cut\n\nBulls are stampeding across Wall Street on Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates for the first time in over four years.\n\nThe central bank’s bold move, a 50-basis-point cut, caught analysts off guard and sent the U.S. stock market to fresh record highs at the opening of Thursday’s session.\n\nThe S&P 500 soared to a new all-time high, reaching 5,700 points. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to an unprecedented 42,000 points.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose by 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.5%, although the Russell 2000, representing small-cap stocks, outperformed with a surge of over 2%.\n\nThe market rally was primarily driven by the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of the Magnificent Seven are recording daily gains ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, solidly in positive territory.\n\nChart: S&P 500 Hits Record Highs\n\nImage: Benzinga Pro\n\nStrong Labor Market Eases Slowdown Fears, Analysts Boost Rate-Cut Wagers\n\nThursday’s economic data further boosted investor confidence. Weekly jobless claims came in well below expectations, suggesting a lower-than-expected trend of rising unemployment.\n\nContinuing jobless claims also dropped more than expected, hinting at a potential absorption of long-term unemployed individuals into the job market.\n\nThis data alleviated concerns about rising unemployment and provided a more optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nWall Street analysts quickly adjusted their expectations following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. There is now growing anticipation of additional rate cuts, diverging from the cautious tone expressed in the Fed’s September “dot plot” and Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks during the press conference.\n\nNotably, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius revised his forecast from expecting a 25-basis-point cut at every other meeting to predicting a rate cut at every meeting. He even left the door open for a back-to-back 50-basis-point reduction in November.\n\nThursday’s 5 Top-Performing S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAmong the S&P 500, the top five performers as of 10 a.m. ET were:\n\nName 1-day Return Darden Restaurants, Inc.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2024, held earlier this month, brought several significant updates on the technology sector for investors, particularly focusing on innovation and financial growth across growth industries. Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\n\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, noting how his company had been way ahead of the others in building AI infrastructure over the past decade. Kurian underlined that these investments were now starting to bear fruit. For example, he revealed that 90% of AI unicorns run on cloud services offered by Google for training and inference. 60% of all AI funded start-ups ever use AI infrastructure developed by Google for training or inference.\n\nKurian, who was at software firm Oracle before joining Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), added that traditional companies were also now building both high-performance and generative AI models on the Google Cloud. Kurian gave the example of carmaker Ford Motor Company, detailing that Ford was using the deep learning technology of Google to build simulations for wind tunnel and for virtual wind tunnel simulation, replacing a traditional approach called computational fluid dynamics.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A startup founded by a former Google executive aims to use artificial intelligence to improve weather forecasting, joining technology behemoths like Nvidia Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co. in an increasingly crowded field.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density Pipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate\n\nBrightband has raised a $10 million series A led by Prelude Ventures, with participation from investors including Bain & Co.’s Future Back Ventures and Slack co-founder Cal Henderson, the company said Thursday. It was launched this summer by Julian Green, who was previously at Google X, and three scientists with the aim of developing a paid product along with an open-source AI forecasting model trained on raw weather observations.\n\nBrightband will initially focus on predicting the behavior of extreme weather, including heat waves and tropical cyclones, several days in advance of traditional forecasts, co-founder Amy McGovern, a professor of computer science and meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, said in an interview.\n\nWithin the past year, Google owner Alphabet Inc., Huawei and Nvidia have launched machine-learning models that can churn out a forecast in seconds, though some researchers have raised questions about how accurately they can perform against traditional methods under testing.\n\nMany of these models are trained on the same underlying data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, an intergovernmental organization that keeps records going back decades but still relies on physics-based modeling to fill in holes.\n\nBy contrast, Brightband will attempt to produce medium-range forecasts, which predict the weather 10 to 14 days in advance, using only information gathered from historical weather observations — leaving out any physics-based data that’s standing in for missing or unreliable measurements.\n\nPulling that off will require a tremendous amount of raw, observed weather data, which Brightband plans to draw from government agencies and private satellite firms. Eventually, the startup plans to incorporate data from weather stations placed atop users’ homes and businesses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\n\nShould Investors Be Overly Cautious?\n\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\n\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\n\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\n“...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.”\n\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\n\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\n\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\n\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $1941.84 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is one of the world's largest technology companies. It encompasses a wide range of businesses, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo, and is known for its innovative products and services, and its focus on AI and other cutting-edge technologies.\n\nThe company also has a direct presence in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business division. More than 700 Waymo cars are present in San Francisco alone, and they have also come under criticism for fires, crashes, and traffic violations. It also offers robotaxi services, and Waymo shared in August that it offers 100,000 robotaxi rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is projected to achieve a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In Q2, Cloud revenue alone increased by 28.8%. Overall revenue grew by 13.59%, totaling $84.74 billion. Google currently holds approximately 91.06% of the search engine market.\n\nGoogle plans to spend $50 billion on AI initiatives by the end of 2024. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leverages strong competitive advantages through its algorithms, AI expertise, and valuable data access. Its capabilities suggest a positive outlook for the future. 216 hedge funds are long GOOGL, with the highest stake at $8,856,226,893 by Fisher Asset Management.\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Gabriel Araujo\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google has agreed for the first time ever to purchase nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup, its first engagement with carbon projects in the South American country.\n\nGoogle will buy 50,000 metric tons of carbon removal credits by 2030 from Mombak, which purchases degraded land from farmers and ranchers or partners with them to replant native species in the Amazon rainforest, the firms said on Thursday.\n\nGoogle, which had previously bought engineered removal credits, follows fellow U.S. tech giant Microsoft, which last year inked a deal to buy up to 1.5 million credits from Mombak.\n\nThe Brazilian startup and Google did not reveal terms of the deal. In 2023, when it sold credits to McLaren Racing, Mombak priced them at an average of more than $50 per ton.\n\n\"The vote of confidence for us and this sector in general that comes from Google stepping into this is a really positive signal,\" Mombak's Chief Technology Officer Dan Harburg said in an interview, hoping it would trigger more deals.\n\nThe announcement comes as companies and authorities gather this month in New York for its annual Climate Week.\n\nEarlier this week, Facebook owner Meta agreed to buy up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits from Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual's forestry arm.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce are the co-founders of the so-called Symbiosis Coalition, which pledges to contract for up to 20 million tons of nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030.\n\nCarbon offsets allow companies to make up for greenhouse gas emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere to meet corporate climate goals. Each credit represents a reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nCritics of carbon offset markets, including Greenpeace, say they allow emitters to keep releasing greenhouse gases.\n\n(Reporting by Gabriel Araujo; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "title": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Won't Be Magnificent Buys in 5 Years",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" are a group of the world's most popular and promising growth stocks. Investing in these big-name tech stocks has been a great way to earn some significant returns in recent years. But things can change quickly in the tech world, and just because some stocks have done well in recent years doesn't mean that they will be solid stocks to hang on to in the long run.\n\nThree Magnificent Seven stocks that I don't think will look so magnificent in five years are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these particular stocks could struggle in the years ahead.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet used to be a stock I was bullish about. The business looked dominant with a top video streaming website (YouTube) and a top search engine (Google).\n\nNowadays, I'm not as optimistic. As the ads get longer and longer on YouTube, the risk is that it might give users an incentive to switch to a streaming service such as Netflix instead, where there's a broad range of top content to choose from to help justify its price tag without annoying ads (depending on the subscription tier).\n\nBut the biggest risk for Alphabet undoubtedly comes in its search business. Regulators have already ruled that Google is a monopoly, and the consequences of that are still unknown, but they'll likely hurt its growth prospects. And with more artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots answering questions and reducing the need to go to Google, that's another headwind for its sales growth.\n\nThe stock might look cheap, trading at just 23 times its trailing earnings, and its revenue is still strong, growing by 14% year over year in the latest reported quarter, but investors shouldn't gloss over the long-term risks that Alphabet faces. There could be some daunting new challenges and competition that could stunt its growth and reduce its earnings power, which is why I would avoid the stock right now.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nAnother business that's doing well right now but could struggle in the future is Meta Platforms. Business has been booming for the company: Revenue jumped 22% year over year in the June quarter, totaling $39.1 billion. Meta management says its AI assistant will be \"the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe present looks solid, but the future might not be as promising. Like Alphabet, Meta faces challenges from regulators. Concerns relating to the company's social media platforms and their alleged adverse mental health effects on users might lead to changes in Meta's operations that could impact the bottom line. Last year, 42 state attorneys general sued Meta, claiming that Facebook and Instagram were too addictive for young kids. Elsewhere, greater restrictions are being called for on the data Meta collects and how it collects it. The social media platforms it operates could become less valuable for advertisers if the restrictions are added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen there is the continued massive spending by Meta on its Reality Labs segment and a metaverse that is showing little sign of ever providing the return on investment needed to justify it.\n\nAt 27 times earnings, Meta's stock doesn't look too expensive, but that could change if its growth slows down while the spending remains high. This is a tech stock I would avoid -- it could have a long way to fall in the next few years.\n\n3. Tesla\n\nThe most expensive stock on this list (based on valuation) is Tesla; investors are paying more than 60 times earnings to buy shares in it. But that isn't uncommon for the electric vehicle (EV) maker. Investors are accustomed to paying high multiples for the stock. This year, however, hasn't been a great one -- the stock is down around 7%.\n\nInvestors are concerned about the company's thinning margins due to a rise in competition and weak consumer demand. Neither one of those issues might improve anytime soon. A possible recession could hurt demand in the short term, and while that might be temporary, growing competition from Chinese EV makers could lead to Tesla needing to further reduce its prices, which would only exacerbate worries about its bottom line.\n\nTesla hopes that a successful launch of its robotaxi program could be a catalyst, but that could prove to be an underwhelming development for the company given the potential for regulatory issues and other obstacles.\n\nAs challenging as conditions are for Tesla right now, they could get worse for the stock over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon’s new RTO mandate is ‘a triumph of traditional management over innovative management,’ says former Google exec",
        "content": "Laszlo Bock, consultant and former Google senior executive, likened Andy Jassy’s demand that Amazon employees spend five days a week in the office to ordering the usual at a restaurant.\n\nSay the hamburger is your pick of choice at the regular joint and you all of a sudden go for the grilled chicken, Bock suggested. The chicken turns out to be okay, “no better than the hamburger, it’s no worse.” Naturally, you’ll revert back to the burger, or the norm.\n\n“You default back to what you’re comfortable with,” Bock told Fortune. The Gretel AI data platform cofounder is a corporate culture expert and was senior people exec at Google from 2006 to 2016, a period during which the tech giant was named Best Company to Work For dozens of times. “Why would you ever have the chicken sandwich again?” he asked.\n\nIt’s a classic tale of executives falling back into the familiar schedule of fully in-person work after five years of attempting or waffling on flexible, remote, or hybrid schedules. Joining the ranks this week was Amazon, as Jassy increased the mandated number of in-office days from three to five, in a note sent to employees on Monday. Amazon responded to requests for comment by referring Fortune to said memo.\n\nThe memo, posted on the company site, stressed the importance of in-person attendance as nourishment for company culture and collaboration. It also outlined changing the structure to reducer staff in management positions.\n\nBock called the move “a triumph of traditional management over innovative management,” explaining that the latter style is more difficult and needs more data to support its implementation.\n\nWhy do execs detest flexible work?\n\nHybrid work can be a successful boost to productivity if managed well, said Bock, pointing to early studies, work from companies like Atlassian that host community events, and the success of employers implementing focal days. During the early days of the pandemic, productivity increased after companies put effort into their plans. In turn, employees responded positively to it, added Bock, author of the New York Times bestseller Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead.\n\nYet to actually do hybrid work well requires resources, a clear plan, and above all, buy in. Most companies aren’t looking to put in the effort without guaranteed results, therefore dampening the potential benefit of mixed-mode work. In the absence of an effective flexible schedule, hybrid work’s cons became all the more clear— including a diffuse culture, feeling of disconnect, generic culture, and managers who don’t feel in control, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“From a company perspective there is not clear, overwhelming evidence that this is good,” Bock said And because it’s such a change, executives need an evidence windfall to alter course. “Employees love it” because it values their autonomy and freedom. But they lose out when employers, especially big ones like Amazon that struggle due to their size, pull out of hybrid plans.\n\nIn a sense companies fumbled the bag on hybrid work, giving up on a new strategy once it stopped being sexy enough. Or in other words, executives “created a self fulfilling prophecy that is now dragging people back to the office kicking and screaming.”\n\nWill Amazon actually lose talent?\n\nAmazon’s announcement wasn’t exactly met with open arms. Some employees expressed dismay and disapproval over the mandate, as one posted on Slack that it's a sign of “going backwards,” according to Business Insider.\n\nCompanies run the risk of losing out on top talent when they shirk flexibility, but Bock seems to think that Amazon isn’t running a terrible gamble here. “Very few people vote with their feet,” he said, adding that the strategy likely won’t hurt the company in the long run. Even though it’s controversial and many remote or hybrid Amazonians are likely peeved, many won’t leave, he noted. And successful companies will continue to have a large talent pool to draw from even if they are rolling out polarizing ultimatums, he said.\n\nAs for the new management strategy, Bock sees it as a way to pare micromanaging. It’s a “very clear call for productivity, but it's also a call for managers focusing on actually making things work better,” he said. He referenced Google’s rule of seven, which didn't hire managers for teams with fewer than seven employees as to disperse their time and tamp down over involvement that could border on control.\n\nEven so, with all this change, he “imagine[s] it's going to be a very stressful time for managers at Amazon.” Despite getting flamed online, this isn’t all that out of the ordinary for Amazon. It “reflects their values,” as a tight organizational culture which is intense and is rooted in close management, he said.\n\nCalling the memo \"entirely expected and actually quite thoughtful,\" Bock praised their data-driven approach and added that many companies will likely follow suit. And this approach perhaps is better in the long-term as humans crave social connection and tend to lose that during poorly executed hybrid plans, he added.\n\nRather than simply issuing an edict like a banking CEO who simply sees RTO as important, Amazon is tying its mandate to internal data and culture, he explained Bock. While some companies tried to wait for the (still impending) downturn to get their in-office way and others went for the incremental “boil the frog” route, neither turned out all that effective\n\nBut Amazon will likely get its way.  “They will force it...they’ll make it happen,” said Bock. He has “no doubt they’re going to measure it and monitor it” and that  “they're going to fire people for noncompliance.”\n\nAnd more edicts might be forthcoming. Amazon is a sort of bellwether for others, and “all of tech has kind of moved in this direction,” noted Bock. In other words, “most companies just don't put in the effort, and they just keep ordering the cheeseburger.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\n\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports reveal that the company will be reworking plans to build a data center in Chile after authorities in the Chilean government raised concerns about the environmental impact of the project. The $200 million data center was approved in 2020 but has since faced stiff resistance from environmental activists who allege it would have an impact on the parched aquifer in the capital of the country. The US tech giant has informed environmental regulators that it will use air-cooled technology at the original location of the project in a bid to ease concerns about environmental impacts of the data center.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian recently said that 60% to 70% of AI startups were using AI hardware clusters made by his company to train their AI models. Kurian made the comments during a Goldman Sachs technology conference. Kurian said his company had monetized compute instances on a consumption basis and had established a price platform on a token basis for the purpose.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "What has Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Done Since Nvidia Earnings?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock lost 4% in the last 30 days. Last month saw volatility as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) released its quarterly print and more.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), representing the semiconductor industry, have lost ~7% in the last 30 days. Now, let’s run down the events for Taiwan Semiconductor since Nvidia released its quarterly print.\n\nOn August 28, Nvidia reported second-quarter topline growth of 122% to $30.04 billion, quashing the analyst consensus of $28.68 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Intel Looks To Restructure Foundry Business, Bags Major US Deal and Government Grants\n\nThe company projected third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion—$33.15 billion, versus the consensus of $31.77 billion.\n\nStill, the stock dropped by 6% in after-hours trading, sending semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI), down as the print failed to impress the Street.\n\nThe semiconductor sector selloff continued in September, with U.S.-China geopolitical tensions intensifying due to the Western counterpart’s artificial intelligence technology embargo on the Asian counterpart.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor remained invested in solidifying its moat by localizing neon gas production, a key chipmaking material disrupted by the Ukraine war, and fast-tracking the development of silicon photonics to address the energy and data transmission speeds needed by AI computing.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor projected a 50% growth in AI accelerators at the Semicon Taiwan industry forum in Taipei despite concerns over the sustainability of the AI frenzy, which is sending jitters across the market. Broadcom Inc’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly print and guidance did little to contain the semiconductor selloff.\n\nOn the brighter side, reports indicated that the contract chipmaker’s production yield at the Arizona facility is at par with its Taiwan facilities.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor reported 33% topline growth in August 2024, testimony to the smartphone market recovery and continued demand for Nvidia AI chips. Analysts expect third-quarter revenue growth of 37%.\n\nSome of Taiwan Semiconductors key September wins included a Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google smartphone deal involving Pixel 10 and Pixel 11 chips and Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) A16 chip at its Arizona Fab.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is up over 90% in the last 12 months as it led the global foundry market, commanding a 62% share in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock closed at $167.28 on Wednesday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here)\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports indicate that the authorities in Ireland have initiated a cross-border inquiry into an AI model marketed by Google. The data protection department in Ireland has said that it will review whether Google complied with EU obligations before processing personal data of EU users to help develop the foundational AI model named Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2). The Irish government has previously conducted such inquiries against social media platform X as well.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has received bullish calls from Wall Street. Stifel analyst Mark Kelley raised the price target on the stock to $199 from $196 and kept a Buy rating, detailing that the company reported revenue and operating income ahead of expectations with continued strength in Search and a slight beat in Google Cloud, though YouTube growth slowed relative to Q1. The analyst further added that the AI commentary of the management was encouraging.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Alphabet Vs. Meta Platforms: D.A. Davidson Selects the Superior ‘Magnificent 7’ Stock to Buy",
        "content": "It’s no secret that the tech sector has been the main driver of the current bull market. Tech is heavily overrepresented in the market indexes, making up more than one fourth of the S&P 500 and an even larger proportion of the NASDAQ 100 – and the mega-cap Magnificent 7 stocks have been leading the way.\n\nThese are the 800-pound gorillas of the tech sector, known for their innovative products and their heavy investments in cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence. With their deep pockets and deeper expertise, the Magnificent 7 tech stocks are among the leaders of the AI boom, and they’re positioning themselves to leverage the transformations that AI is sure to bring, transformations that could be far greater than any past technological breakthrough\n\nBut some of these giants might represent a better opportunity for investors than others. With this in mind, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is taking the measure of two Mag 7 shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) – and coming down to a recommendation on which one is the superior Mag 7 stock to buy right now. Here are the details.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFirst up, Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube and the dominant company in the fields of internet search and digital advertising. The company’s success has pushed it to just under a $2 trillion market cap, making it the fourth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street and one of just 6 trillion-dollar-plus companies.\n\nEven on the top tier, companies have to work to maintain their position. Alphabet has been proactive at this, leveraging its tech experience and expertise to develop new tools and applications for a rapidly approaching future. Prominent among Alphabet’s projects are multiple ventures into the world of AI.\n\nAlphabet is using AI to enhance the functionality of its internet search arm, combining generative AI with multimodal large language models to improve the capabilities of Google in both understanding requests and in delivering results. The company is also using AI tech in its online language translation services and in AI-powered text creation tools. The aim here is not solely to make Google or YouTube better, but also to develop a competitive edge against challengers such as Microsoft’s Bing search engine or against gen-AI content creators such as ChatGPT.\n\nAll of this is embodied in Alphabet’s Gemini model, the company’s strongest development of artificial intelligence. At its core, Gemini is a collection of large language models, and is designed to understand audio, images, text, video, and even code – all to give the most flexibility in the end use. Alphabet is working to integrate Gemini into all of its products, from Google to the Android operating system, and to put the model to use in chatbots, text generation, software coding – pretty much any form of content creation that an end-user can imagine. The key challenge for Alphabet will be maintaining market share as the search world shifts toward AI-powered tools.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is an issue noted by Davidson’s Gil Luria, who thinks there are reasons for caution here, mainly due to the company’s uphill road in integrating AI technology into its products but also in the legal repercussions of its current near-absolute dominance of online search. Luria writes, “While the company has maintained an almost monopolistic grip on the global Search market for years, many would argue that this dominance is under siege with the introduction of AI-enhanced search and chatbots. The rise of models like OpenAI’s GPT, which has been tightly integrated into Microsoft’s ecosystem, highlights this vulnerability inside of Google that despite its leadership in AI research and its massive data advantage, the company has struggled over the years to translate these assets into competitive commercial products at the same pace as its competitors.”\n\nOf more immediate importance, the analyst sees problems piling up on Alphabet’s horizon, and adds, “Shorter-term, Google will be navigating the transition from having 90% share in Search to something less than that as AI-enhanced Search becomes the new category. This transition will also become more difficult as it has to accommodate the DOJ charges that were specifically aimed at now allowing Google to sustain this monopoly during the transition.”\n\nFor Luria, this adds up to a Neutral (Hold) rating for the stock, while his $170 price target points toward a one-year upside potential upside of 7%. (To watch Luria’s track record, click here)\n\nAlphabet, like many of the major tech companies, has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street’s stock analysts – and there are 36 recent reviews on record for the stock. These include 27 to Buy and 9 to Hold, giving the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $202.94 represents a gain of 27.5% from current levels. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe second stock on our radar here is the world’s leading social media company, Meta Platforms. Through its main social media subsidiaries – Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp – Meta can reach more than one-third of the world’s population. At the end of June this year, the company reported that its Daily Active People (DAP) across the family of platforms was 3.27 billion, an extraordinary number, and one that was up 7% year-over-year.\n\nThat huge reach supports Meta’s core money-making business, its digital advertising sales. The company reported a 10% increase in the average price per ad, as well as a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the company’s family of platforms in 2Q24.\n\nIn raw numbers, that translated into quarterly revenues of $39.07 billion, up 22% from the prior year and $760 million better than had been forecast. The company’s Q2 bottom line came to $5.16 per share, beating the estimates by 40 cents per share.\n\nMeta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have been leading the social media wave for the better part of two decades now – but the company is not resting on its laurels. Meta is also positioning itself as a leader in artificial intelligence technology. The company already uses AI to fine-tune and narrowly target its ad impressions, and also uses AI tech in translation algorithms to make the platforms accessible across languages. But in addition, Meta is also moving into generative AI and working to expand the audience for AI generally.\n\nThe company has developed an open-source AI model, Llama, and is already on Llama 3. The platform aims to make AI more flexible and more accessible; its open-source code allows users to tweak the platform to meet their own unique needs, as well as to publish improvements that everyone can use.\n\nMeta has also released the Meta AI, an AI assistant/chatbot, across all of its social media platforms, as a direct challenge to the gen AI leader, ChatGPT. Meta AI has seen successes, and at the end of August, the company reported that the AI chatbot had already reached 400 million monthly active users and 40 million daily active users.\n\nMeta’s AI work is taking shape in the company’s Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute technology platforms. The first of these integrates the infrastructure, models, and frameworks that the company will need to put together AI apps at the scale needed to serve an audience of billions, while the second refers to the AR, VR, and immersive environments – what the company calls its ‘metaverse’ – that will let users interact seamlessly with the AI. Llama and Meta AI are the current applications available – but Foundation and Spatial Compute are where the rubber meets the road, and Meta plans to follow that road to the next generation of AI tech.\n\nAll of this makes Meta Platforms, in analyst Luria’s view, the superior Mag 7 stock for investors to buy right now. Luria says of this company, “We see META as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation… Meta’s strategic positioning in AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute signals a forward-looking bet on the next wave of technological transformation, where scale, capital intensity, and platform control will define market leadership.”\n\nGetting to the details, the analyst adds, “In AI Foundation Compute, Meta’s scale and access to massive datasets, high-performance infrastructure, and specialized developer talent offer a distinct advantage while similarly, in Spatial Compute, Meta’s multi-billion-dollar investments in Reality Labs and hardware platforms like Quest and Meta Ray-Bans give it the resources and ecosystem to shape this next computing paradigm, just as Apple and Google shaped mobile computing in the past decade.”\n\nBased on this, Luria rates META stock as a Buy, and his $600 price target suggests that he sees a gain of 12% coming on the one-year horizon.\n\nOverall, the Street is also bullish on Meta. The stock has picked up 45 analyst recommendations lately, which include 41 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $584.82 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 9% premium.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee, Jody Godoy\n\nBRUSSELS/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google took a major step this year to end an EU antitrust investigation with an offer to sell its advertising marketplace AdX but European publishers rejected the proposal as insufficient, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.\n\nGoogle's lucrative ad tech business attracted EU regulatory scrutiny last year following a complaint from the European Publishers Council.\n\nThe European Commission subsequently charged Google with favouring its own advertising services, opening its fourth case against the world's most-popular search engine.\n\nGoogle has never before offered to sell an asset in an antitrust case, according to three lawyers involved in antitrust cases who did not have permission to speak publicly.\n\nThe company is on trial in the U.S., fighting claims by antitrust authorities who seek to make Google sell its Ad Manager product, which contains AdX and Google's publisher ad server, known as DFP.\n\nPublishers rejected Google's proposal because they want it to divest more than just AdX to address conflicts of interest due to its presence in almost all levels of the ad tech supply chain, the people said. They said the EU antitrust enforcer was aware of the offer.\n\n\"As we have said before, the European Commission's case about our third-party display advertising products rests on flawed interpretations of the ad-tech sector, which is fiercely competitive and rapidly evolving. We remain committed to this business,\" a Google spokesperson said.\n\nThe Commission declined to comment. The European Publishers Council did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdX, or Ad Exchange, is a marketplace where publishers can make their unsold ad space available to advertisers for purchase on a real-time basis.\n\nEU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last year suggested that Google divest its sell-side tools DFP and AdX to end conflicts of interest.\n\nStill, the Commission is unlikely to force Google to divest assets for now but may instead order it to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices in the coming months because of the complexity of the case, other sources have told Reuters.\n\nThey said a divestment order could come later if Google fails to comply with the first EU decision likely to be issued in the coming months.\n\nGoogle's 2023 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $237.85 billion or 77% of total revenue. It is the world's dominant digital-advertising platform.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee in Brussels and Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Rod Nickel)",

        "title": "Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?",
        "content": "Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a household name, and for good reason. That little blue-and-gold card has become a global symbol of convenience, tucked away in wallets around the world, supported by strong financials, a dominant market position and strategic investments in emerging technologies like blockchain and digital wallets. However, with its stock trading at a premium price-earnings ratio above 30 and facing rising competition from fintech disruptors like Block (NYSE:SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), the stock seems to be fairly valued and is a hold for me at current levels.\n\nWhile the company's strong financials and market position make it an attractive long-term investment, in the short term, the premium valuation limits upside potential.\n\nOverview of recent performance\n\nThe stock has been quite stable in recent months, consistently closing around $276.37. Up around 13.31% year to date, this is a fairly good performance, especially after adjusting for the economic headwinds consumers have had to endure. Although existing problems such as inflationary pressures and high interest rates continued to affect consumers' demand, transaction volumes as well as revenues have remained constant and even improved for Visa. This goes a long way in explaining its capacity to deliver above-average results.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Visa disclosed a net revenue of $8.90 billion, up 9.60% from the same period last year, while its net income rose by 17.20% to $4.87 billion. These robust numbers indicated the company is able to achieve steady growth no matter how hard the going gets; the result of its market leadership coupled with operational excellence. That being said, the economic environment remains rather volatile.\n\nRevenue and net income growth\n\nThe following chart shows a steady rise in Visa's revenue and net income over the first three quarters of 2024. Revenue increased from $8.10 billion in the first quarter to $8.90 billion by the third quarter. Net income also followed an upward path, growing from $4.16 billion to $4.87 billion over the same period. Although this growth is not explosive, it highlights Visa's ability to maintain solid, reliable performance even in a challenging economic environment. Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?\n\nSo why the wobble? Let's look a little closer.\n\nWhat's moving the needle? A look behind the numbers\n\nVisa's premium valuation is well justified by its exceptional growth potential, market leadership and consistent financial performance. Trading at a price-earnings ratio of 30.20above the broader market averagethe stock commands a higher valuation, but for good reason. Its ability to steadily increase both revenue and profits, despite global economic challenges, is a testament to its resilience. This premium reflects investors' confidence in Visa's future dominance in the payments space, as the company continues to innovate and expand internationally.\n\nTo illustrate how Visa's valuation stands compared to the market, consider the following chart comparing its price-earnings ratio against the market average. Visa Is Still the Payment King, but What's Next?\n\nVisa's elevated earnings multiple suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for its potential growth, but it also highlights the vulnerability to market corrections if the company doesn't meet its growth expectations. Now, let's dig deeper.\n\nThere is also its PEG ratio of 2.10. Some may consider this metric, which takes earnings growth into consideration, to be higher than desirable, but it is more a product of the marketplace's belief in Visa's capacity to maintain rapid growth. This is why investors are willing to pay a premium to enjoy the future expansion of Visa's digital payments, and its international market expansion. This PEG ratio indicates that this company's performance is not only rock-steady but contains a growth component as well.\n\nFurther, Visa has an enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 22 that is higher than that of its industry peers, which are estimated to be between 15 and 18 times, indicating the efficiency of its operations and its capacity to produce solid cash flows. The company has maintained high operating margins and its current standing at 66.70% with almost $13 billion in cash allows it to participate in strategic acquisitions and investments. This goes some way toward explaining its higher EV/Ebitda ratio because Visa has remained a brilliant allocator of capital.\n\nThe price-sales ratio of 18.40 is also a testament to the market's appreciation of the fact Visa has been translating its robust sales figures to even better profits. Nonetheless, this rate is way above the sector average.\n\nLastly, Visa's free cash flow yield of 3.50%, while slightly below the industry average, underscores its consistent ability to generate substantial cash flows. With $14.42 billion in free cash flow over the past nine months, the comany is well-positioned to continue reinvesting in future growth and rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The cash flow, combined with a low payout ratio of 21.90%, suggests there's ample room for dividend growth, which makes it an attractive choice for long-term investors seeking both capital appreciation and income.\n\nWhere does Visa go from here?\n\nSo where does Visa go from here? Despite the challenges, the company isn't just sitting back. It is pushing hard into digital payments and expanding in international markets, where there's still plenty of room for growth. For example, its international transaction revenue for the nine months ended June 30 hit $15.40 billion, up from $13.50 billion the previous year. That's a solid 14.10% increase, showing it is successfully leveraging its global network.\n\nHowever, Visa's focus is not limited to analogue transactions, though that is where it started from. It is embracing new trends in payments solutions such as decentralized wallets and blockchain to be on track with the ever-evolving market. For example, Visa Direct has become a real-time payment mechanism with a rather large presence. The company has further ventured into peer-to-peer transactions through integration with other digital wallet providers such as PayPal and Venmo. These affiliations help it address the issue of capturing the market of young people of the technological era, where cashless transactions are gradually dominating.\n\nBlockchain technology is also on the radar at Visa, especially when it comes to international remittances. Earlier this year, it moved to stablecoin settlements using USDC on the Ethereum network in partnership with Circle. This is a rather progressive approach that effectively places Visa at the heart of decentralized finance. One of the biggest benefits of using blockchain is time and cost savings in international payments, which can be a powerful tool to increase revenue in international markets.\n\nChallenges\n\nBut before you start thinking Visa is invincible, let's talk about a few of the challenges it is facing.\n\nFirst, the company is tangled up in a few legal battles over interchange fees and other practices, which could cost it bigboth in terms of dollars and reputation. As of June 30, it has set aside $1.69 billion for litigation. That's not pocket change, even for Visa.\n\nThen there's competition. The payments space is crowded, and it's getting more crowded every day with fintech startups and other established players like Block and PayPal gaining market share, while tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are pushing hard with Apple Pay and Google Pay, respectively. These companies are offering innovative, often cheaper, payment solutions that could potentially erode Visa's market dominance\n\nAnd finally, there's the whole priced for perfection thing. With a price-earnings ratio north of 30, investors are expecting Visa to keep hitting it out of the park. Any slip-upwhether it's a missed earnings target or a macroeconomic shockcould send the stock tumbling.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nVisa is still a powerhouse with a lot going for itstrong financials, a dominant market position and operating in a high barrier of entry market with a track record of smart investments in digital wallets and blockchain. However, its premium valuation means investors are paying for high growth expectations. For those reasons, I am a hold on the stock currently.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google won a court fight with the European Union over a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) fine for thwarting competition for online ads, partly making up for last week’s crushing defeat in a separate judgment for abusing its monopoly powers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Pipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate To Build a Happier City, Design for Density London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\n\nJudges at the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg backed the Alphabet Inc. unit’s challenge to a fine doled out in 2019, saying regulators were mostly correct in their findings but made key mistakes in their probe linked to the duration of the alleged wrongdoing.\n\nThe European Commission had concluded that Google — as a dominant online ad broker — illegally prevented rivals such as Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. from placing ads on third-party websites. Wednesday’s ruling can still be appealed at the bloc’s top tribunal, the Court of Justice.\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of two court successes for antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and her bid to rein in Silicon Valley. Last week she won victories at the top court against Google’s attempt to avoid a €2.4 billion antitrust penalty for favoring its own product results on search and Apple Inc.’s bid to skirt a €13 billion Irish tax bill.\n\nThe EU’s case into Google’s AdSense service is the last of a trilogy of court disputes over cases that set the course for Vestager’s tenure, which is about to end after a decade.\n\nAlphabet shares rose 0.2% at 9:41 a.m. in New York.\n\nEU regulators targeted Google’s role as an ad broker for websites, where the AdSense for Search product placed advertising on platforms including newspaper websites, blogs and travel sites.\n\nWhen the Brussels watchdog hit Google with the €1.5 billion penalty in 2019, it said Google’s contracts with websites prevented them from accepting rival search ads from the likes of Microsoft and Yahoo. When a user would input a query on a Google search box on websites, ads from such rivals were blocked. The problematic contracts were all dropped by 2016, when the EU escalated the investigation.\n\nEU Mistakes\n\nDespite confirming “the majority of the commission’s findings,” judges in Wednesday’s ruling said that regulators blundered in their assessment of the duration of the disputed clauses, as well as the part of the market covered by them during 2016.\n\nThe EU commission “has not established that the three clauses it had identified each constituted an abuse of a dominant position and, together, a single and continuous infringement” of antitrust rules, the court said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a hearing two years ago, Google’s lawyers described the EU’s 2019 penalty as representing a “quasi criminal fine of very large proportions.”\n\nMountain View, California-based Google said on Wednesday it’s “pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine. We will review the full decision closely.”\n\n“This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites,” the company said. “We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the commission’s decision.”\n\nThe Brussels-based commission said it “will carefully study the judgment and reflect on possible next steps.”\n\nThe EU’s Google cases marked the centerpiece of Vestager’s efforts to crack down on the growing power of big tech companies. She’s fined the Alphabet unit more than €8 billion to date and has also launched a fourth case into Google’s advertising technology business, suggesting that the firm needs to be broken up to allay antitrust concerns. A final decision in that probe is pending.\n\nFollowing the EU’s lead, the US Department of Justice has also taken on Google. Like Vestager, it’s also pushed for a breakup of Google’s adtech business, as a trial gets underway across the Atlantic.\n\n(Updates with Google shares in the sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. is winning over investors and analysts as it sees a resurgence in sales growth driven by artificial intelligence-fueled demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Pipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate To Build a Happier City, Design for Density London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\n\nShares in the software giant are up almost 60% this year, with a chunk of those gains coming after last month’s estimate-beating earnings and forecast for sales to roughly double over the next five years. Two recent analyst upgrades have left Wall Street at its most bullish in more than six years, with 24 firms rating Oracle shares a buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares in the company were edging lower, falling 1% on Wednesday.\n\nThe newfound popularity has come as Oracle cements its status as an AI winner. It’s been focused on expanding its cloud infrastructure business — which competes with Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — and has developed a reputation for success with generative AI workloads, helping to boost its overall revenue growth.\n\n“Growth is inflecting higher, at a pace much faster than we’ve been used to at Oracle, and that’s a huge positive,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “At the same time, it’s been something of an under-the-radar name, and while the valuation has recently risen, it is still cheaper than other tech names.”\n\nEven after a great year, there’s still some way to go to shake off Oracle’s underdog status compared with larger cloud players like Microsoft and smaller rivals like Salesforce Inc. Over the past five fiscal years, Oracle’s revenue growth has averaged about 6%, compared with 14% for Microsoft and more than 20% for Salesforce.\n\nHowever, Oracle is expected to see revenue growth of about 10% in the current fiscal year and a further acceleration in 2026 and 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s mainly due to growth in its cloud infrastructure business, where sales are forecast to jump 55% this year.\n\nOracle’s stock rally this year — adding more than $170 billion in market value — has boosted its valuation to 26 times forward earnings, up from about 18 times at the beginning of the year. That’s still cheaper than some larger peers like Microsoft and Amazon, and it isn’t deterring analysts and investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We find it hard not to put a 25x multiple on a company set to grow faster than Salesforce and Adobe,” Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a report on Monday, upgrading his rating on Oracle to buy from hold. “Investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth.”\n\nReitzes’ report followed an upgrade by JMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens, who raised his rating to market outperform from market perform on Sept. 10, citing accelerating revenue growth and expectations for further market share gains in cloud infrastructure services.\n\nStill, even as Wall Street analysts have turned more bullish on the stock in recent months, they prefer other Big Tech names. About 63% of analysts covering Oracle have a buy rating, compared to Alphabet’s 83%, Microsoft 96% and Amazon’s 95%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nGoogle won a court fight with the European Union over a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) fine for thwarting competition for online ads, partly atoning for last week’s crushing defeat in a separate judgment for abusing its monopoly powers. The Taiwanese company Gold Apollo Co., whose brand appears on pagers that exploded in Lebanon, said a company based in Hungary is responsible for manufacturing the models used in the attacks, adding to the mystery around a strike that is escalating tensions in the Middle East. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he is concerned about a potential “chilling effect” on the development of AI posed by a bill to regulate the new technology passed by the state legislature. BlackRock Inc. and Microsoft are teaming up on one of the largest efforts to date to bankroll the build-out of data warehouses and energy infrastructure behind the boom in AI.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Ryan Vlastelica.\n\n(Updates with stock move in paragragh two.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.3 billion and $325.85 billion estimates indicate +14% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet on Wednesday asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit that accuses the tech giant of abusing its dominance in the online search market.\n\nThe lawsuit – valued at up to 7 billion pounds ($9.3 billion) – is the latest case focusing on the business practices of Google, which is currently facing a major antitrust trial in the United States over its online advertising business.\n\nIt is also one of several multibillion-pound cases to have been filed at Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal in recent years, including a similar case against Google for allegedly abusing its dominance in the online advertising market.\n\nConsumer rights campaigner and the lawsuit's class representative Nikki Stopford argues Google's dominance allows it to increase businesses' costs for search advertising services which are then passed on to consumers.\n\nPart of the lawsuit relies on the more than 4-billion-euro ($4.5 billion) fine levied on Google by the European Commission in 2018 for imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices, a decision being appealed by the tech company.\n\nStopford's lawyers also argue Google reached an anticompetitive deal with Apple to make it the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser in exchange for a share of Google's mobile search ad revenues.\n\nThe lawyers asked the Competition Appeal Tribunal to certify the case to proceed towards a trial, a very early step in any mass lawsuit. Google, however, says the case is seriously flawed.\n\n\"The suggestion that consumers have been harmed by the Google conducts at issue is strongly rejected,\" Google's lawyer Meredith Pickford said in court documents.\n\nPickford added that the European Commission's findings were simply \"technical complaints about the particular form by which Google promoted its products\".\n\nHe also said that Google's default search engine agreement with Apple was \"in principle perfectly lawful\". Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n($1 = 0.8994 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Catarina Demony and Mark Potter)",

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia's Monster Gains? Buy This AI Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has almost single-handedly taken the stock market to new highs this year. Well, that may be an exaggeration, but it sure does feel like it. Investors have clamored to own shares of Nvidia after realizing just how essential the semiconductor supplier is to the infrastructure and growth for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The company offers premier computing solutions for AI and has enjoyed incredible pricing power with its customers.\n\nBut what if I told you another technology giant not only has its own Nvidia-like subsidiary, but it's also the only company with the assets to vertically integrate the entire AI supply chain?\n\nEnter Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nThat's right, the owner of Google Search has the hardware, infrastructure, software, and engineering talent built up over a decade that nobody can match in AI tech today. What's more, the stock actually trades at a reasonable earnings multiple after falling 20% from its all-time high in the past several weeks.\n\nHere's why you should buy Alphabet stock if you missed out on Nvidia's monster gains.\n\nAlphabet: The only vertically-integrated player in AI\n\nNvidia has made the graphics processing unit (GPU) a must-have component in the buildout of AI systems, but GPUs have been around far longer than AI has been in the headlines. Inspired by these computer chips, Alphabet began investing in its own computer chip design 10 years ago. It came out with the first tensor processing unit (TPU) in 2015. The goal of TPUs is to optimize Alphabet's massive computing costs stemming from its Google Search, YouTube, and other consumer internet properties.\n\nThis computing hardware has now advanced rapidly. The sixth generation Trillium that launched this year has a 4.7x increase in compute performance versus the prior TPU generation. That is a lot of cost savings that Alphabet will be able to implement across all its new AI products.\n\nTPUs are like Alphabet's in-house Nvidia operation, the backbone of its AI computing. However, it goes much further than just optimizing chip performance. Alphabet has the Google Cloud unit -- powered by TPUs, of course -- that sells Alphabet's AI capabilities to third parties. Google Cloud hit $10.3 billion in revenue last quarter and is growing 29% year over year. There is a long runway for this division as demand for AI grows.\n\nOf course, Alphabet has a data advantage for training AI tools as well. Google Search, YouTube, and other Alphabet properties have billions of users around the world that can be used to train AI models. Alphabet's dataset here is proprietary, which is why OpenAI (the organization behind ChatGPT) may encounter legal trouble from scraping data from YouTube transcripts to train its own AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet has the best AI talent in the world and has been investing in AI researchers since acquiring the DeepMind research lab in 2014. Some competitors may be able to match Alphabet's capabilities on one part of the AI supply chain, such as Amazon with its cloud-computing operation. However, there is no company with the combination of computing tech, cloud infrastructure, data troves, and human talent that can match Alphabet in AI. This is why Alphabet has a head start to win in AI this decade.\n\nLots of growth but at what cost?\n\nThere is clearly growth in demand for AI research and computing capacity. But how will that show up on Alphabet's bottom line and generate more profits for the company? In a conference call this year, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said that there was a bigger risk of underinvesting in AI than potentially overinvesting and wasting money. Shareholders hate wasting money, though, which is perhaps why the market has been bearish on Alphabet stock recently.\n\nManagement is planning on spending tens of billions of dollars on capital investments for new AI capabilities across its various internet properties. In order to get a proper return on this invested capital (ROIC), it will need to keep growing revenue across its three main segments: Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud.\n\nLast quarter, Google Search (which also includes other Google properties) grew revenue 14% to $48.5 billion. YouTube advertising grew 13% to $8.7 billion. Google Cloud, we talked about above. So far, so good for Alphabet in the age of AI. However, investors will need to keep a close eye on revenue growth. If Alphabet spends all this money on AI infrastructure and revenue growth slows, profits will likely fall. That's just how the income statement math works.\n\nThe stock looks like a bargain\n\nAfter the stock's recent drawdown, Alphabet now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 23. That is much lower than other tech industry competitors, such as Apple, which has a P/E of 33 while growing more slowly. The broader S&P 500 index trades at a P/E close to 29.\n\nIf you are a believer in Alphabet's AI advantage, the stock looks like a bargain right now. Revenue growth across its cloud, YouTube, and Google Search segments should translate into strong earnings. Meanwhile, management keeps repurchasing stock and just announced a new dividend, which will boost returns for shareholders.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Alphabet stock at current levels. If I wanted to bet on the growth of AI, this is the stock I would buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Google won a court challenge on Wednesday against a 1.49 billion euro European Union antitrust fine imposed five years ago that targeted its online advertising business.\n\nThe European Union's General Court said it was throwing out the 2019 penalty imposed by the European Commission, which is the 27-nation bloc's top antitrust enforcer.\n\n“The General Court annuls the Commission’s decision in its entirety,” it said in a press release.\n\nThe commission's ruling applied to a narrow portion of Google’s ad business: ads that the U.S. tech giant sold next to Google search results on third-party websites.\n\nRegulators had found that Google inserted exclusivity clauses in its contracts that barred these websites from running similarly placed ads sold by Google’s rivals. The commission, the bloc's top antitrust enforcer, said when it issued the penalty that Google's behavior resulted in advertisers and website owners having less choice and likely facing higher prices that would be passed on to consumers.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen\n\nHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's president and ruling Communist Party chief To Lam is set to meet representatives from several U.S. corporations, including Google and Meta, during a visit to the United States next week, two people briefed about the plans told Reuters.\n\nMeta's Facebook has in the 100-million-people country one of its largest user bases worldwide, and Google makes its smartphones there through suppliers and plans a large data centre, according to a Reuters report last month.\n\nIn his first trip to the United States since he was named in early August as head of the party, the country's most powerful job, Lam is scheduled to meet representatives of Google and Meta, the two people said, with one noting each of the companies would have a separate meeting with him. Neither said what will be discussed.\n\nAnother two people familiar with the plans said Lam will also attend on Sept. 23 a business forum with other U.S. business representatives.\n\nAll the four sources declined to be identified because the information was not public.\n\nThe US-ASEAN Business Council (USABC), which is one of the organisers of the Sept. 23 event, declined to share a list of participants.\n\nGoogle and Facebook did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nIn two large U.S. business missions the USABC lobbying group organised in Vietnam over the last 18 months, it brought in dozens of top U.S. corporations including defence firms, energy and tech companies.\n\nAmong firms who attended both recent missions to Vietnam, are power company AES, aviation giant Boeing, payment company Mastercard and Amazon, including its cloud computing subsidiary Amazon Web Services, according to lists of participants seen by Reuters.\n\nU.S. companies see Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and a market for their products. Apple's suppliers complete many of the company's products there, Intel has a large chip assembling factory, and defence firms have been long in talks to sell security equipment to Hanoi.\n\nBIDEN MEETING?\n\nLam's trip to the United States has not been formally announced, but officials said he would travel there on Saturday to speak at the United Nations General Assembly where global leaders meet for their annual get-together on Sept 22-23. He will fly to Cuba later in the week in the final leg of his trip.\n\nColumbia University has announced an event with Lam on Sept. 23 in New York.\n\nThe U.S. and Vietnam boosted their diplomatic ties last year as Washington sees the Southeast Asian nation as a strategic partner to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The U.S. is also seeking closer ties with Hanoi on sensitive industries, including undersea cables.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether Lam will meet U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nA spokesperson for the White House declined to comment about Lam, but said Biden planned to meet several foreign leaders at the United Nations.\n\nVietnam's foreign ministry and the president office were not immediately available for comments.\n\nLam met Chinese President Xi Jinping last month in his first trip abroad after his appointment as party chief.\n\nHe also plans a state visit to France in early October, an official told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen in Hanoi; additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Gavin Newsom signs AI bills aimed at fighting election deepfakes like those spread by Elon Musk",
        "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom is signing into law three bills that target the misuse of video, audio, and images created by artificial intelligence in a sweeping effort to crack down on election deepfakes.\n\nNewsom had vowed to pass the legislation after billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk recirculated a deepfake video on his platform, X, in July featuring altered footage of Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe governor signed the bills during a fireside chat with Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff at the annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.\n\nAssembly Bill 2355 will require political advertisements to disclose whether they used generative AI to create or alter materials appearing in the ad. AB 2655 will hold large online platforms, such as Meta (META), liable for failing to remove or label deceptive election content within 72 hours of receiving a report by a user.\n\nAnd AB 2839 prohibits individuals from creating or publishing deceptive content about candidates and election workers, made with AI, in the 120 before and 60 days after an election. The measure also allows a judge to order the content to be removed and issue a fine. The measure contains an urgency clause - taking effect immediately.\n\nThe fake Harris audio shared by Musk reached nearly 140 million views over the summer. In the deepfake, Harris's voice is altered to say, “I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility,” adding that she was chosen “because I am the ultimate diversity hire” as “both a woman and a person of color.”\n\nThe video featured edited clips from past appearances by the vice president, but used an AI-generated voice. The YouTuber who originally posted the video disclosed that it was a parody. But Musk did not label the content as misleading, instead writing, \"This is amazing.\" The post was an apparent violation of X's rules.\n\nAt the time, Newsom clapped back at Musk, posting on X, \"Manipulating a voice in an 'ad' like this one should be illegal. I'll be signing a bill in a matter of weeks to make sure it is.\"\n\nCalifornia has taken the lead on regulating AI by introducing a wave of legislation this year. Despite fears of overregulating the emerging technology, analysts view the new laws as a move in the right direction.\n\n\"I think it'll be a positive and will also make people more comfortable advertising on those platforms,\" Harvest Portfolio Management chief investment officer Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Over the last several years, all of the protections have come from the European Union. We live under these 1996 regulations and haven't changed them ever since then. We essentially play second fiddle to the EU on this stuff — we probably should be the leader.\"\n\nNewsom also signed two SAG-AFTRA-related bills — AB 2602 and AB 1836 — aimed at protecting performers from unauthorized AI use. Last year, members of SAG-AFTRA went on strike against major studios and streamers. The performers claimed victory when their new contract offered compensation for the use of their \"digital doubles.\"\n\nPerhaps the most controversial AI bill still sitting on Newsom's desk: SB 1047. The artificial intelligence measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Scott Wiener, would require large-model AI developers to undergo safety testing before deploying the technology.\n\nSB 1047 has deeply divided the tech and political communities — many of whom argue it'll stifle innovation. Supporters say it'll force tech companies, including OpenAI, Meta, and Google (GOOG), to be aggressive in making sure new AI features are safe.\n\nWhile Newsom hasn't indicated whether he plans to sign or veto that bill, insiders say he may side with longtime ally former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who criticized it.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): A Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports indicate that the authorities in Ireland have initiated a cross-border inquiry into an AI model marketed by Google. The data protection department in Ireland has said that it will review whether Google complied with EU obligations before processing personal data of EU users to help develop the foundational AI model named Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2). The Irish government has previously conducted such inquiries against social media platform X as well.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has received bullish calls from Wall Street. Stifel analyst Mark Kelley raised the price target on the stock to $199 from $196 and kept a Buy rating, detailing that the company reported revenue and operating income ahead of expectations with continued strength in Search and a slight beat in Google Cloud, though YouTube growth slowed relative to Q1. The analyst further added that the AI commentary of the management was encouraging.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

So far, at least.\n\nAugmented reality glasses overlay digital images onto a person’s view of the physical world.

The fact that they have so far failed to convince people to wear smart glasses daily hasn’t deterred Google and other companies from pouring money into the effort as they pursue a belief the hardware could one day reshape how people socialize, work and learn.\n\nWhile dwarfed by the Silicon Valley behemoths to the north, Snap, the Los Angeles-based company behind the disappearing messaging app Snapchat is competing in this smart glasses arms race. The company, which unveiled its fifth version of AR glasses at its annual conference Tuesday, hopes improving the device will drive mass consumer adoption.\n\nOther industry giants including Google and Samsung are also working on smart glasses and Apple is exploring the idea. The competition raises the stakes for the publicly-traded Snap as it looks to new products to help reassert itself in the tech world as rivals such as Instagram and TikTok have surged past it to capture eyeballs and market dominance.\n\nRead more:Why Silicon Beach didn't live up to the hype as an L.A. tech powerhouse\n\nBut a future in which augmented reality glasses are a part of our daily lives hasn't arrive yet and a long road still remains ahead, experts say. The future of smart glasses is still murky.\n\n“This is a marathon. It's not a sprint,” said Tuong Huy Nguyen, an analyst at Gartner who is part of a team that researches immersive technologies including AR. “We need an ecosystem of not just hardware and software but content to work together to create seamless experiences.”\n\nSnap first released smart glasses that could record video in 2016, selling them in vending machines in Los Angeles before making them available online. The company reported selling 150,000 pairs, but most people stopped using them after a month and underwhelming demand for the gadget resulted in hundreds of thousands of unsold pairs.\n\nNamed Spectacles, Snap's latest eye wear overlays computer-generated images onto a person’s view of the physical world. The new device builds on the first AR glasses Snap released to software developers in 2021. Snap isn't selling to them to the public, but is making them available to software developers in hopes they'll design experiances for the platform.\n\nWhat people can do with AR glasses remain limited. Snap's glasses can track a person’s hands, allowing users to pick up and assemble virtual Legos, swing a phantom golf club, draw with friends and punch numbers in a digital calculator. It also incorporates some artificial intelligence features that allows users to get answers to questions and conjure an image with a voice command.\n\nIn an attempt to drum up interest, Snap has been leaning into whimsical applications and gaming experiences that it knows users are used to, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive and principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a consulting firm that works with tech companies.\n\nRead more:Snapchat Spectacles, available only in pop-up vending machines, debut to long lines\n\nBut Snap is still treading cautiously as it releases new AR glasses.\n\n“What we can't predict is consumer adoption and so that's why we're taking this more thoughtful approach to how we're releasing this version,” said Sophia Dominguez, Snap’s director of AR Platform. “It could change at any time, and if it does change…we're ready to go.”\n\nDominguez said the company envisions AR glasses one day becoming the primary way people access the digital world. Instead of computer or phone screens, AR glasses, she said, will allow people to keep one foot in each world simultaneously, making it \"easy for you to interact with technology in the same way that you interact with the real world.”\n\nSkepticism whether AR glasses will make this possible runs high.\n\nDonning AR glasses could interfere with how people socialize in the physical world, making them feel less present, said Jeremy Bailenson, a Stanford University professor who founded the college’s virtual human interaction lab.\n\n“Wearing glasses that connect you to digital content, whether it's AR or VR should be done sparingly for special experiences,” he said. “I am not an advocate of blocking your perceptual system, sight and sound for constant surveillance.”\n\nBailenson and other Stanford researchers tested out the Meta Quest 3, a “mixed reality” headset that lets people blend physical and virtual worlds. While the headset is different from AR glasses, the gadget can display real-time video of a user’s surroundings in the physical world.\n\nResearchers, who were accompanied by a chaperone for safety reasons, wore Meta’s headsets while chatting with people, walking around campus and cooking food. They reported that people in the physical world felt less real as if they were watching television rather than interacting with someone face-to-face.\n\nPeople wearing AR glasses will also see a different view of the world than people not wearing the devices and losing that “common ground” will likely impact the way people socialize, Bailenson said.\n\nPrevious attempts at integrating smart glasses into people's lives have not gone well. When Google released smart glasses in 2013 that could shoot photos, videos, they sparked privacy and safety concerns from consumers, lawmakers and business owners. People started calling Google Glass owners who used the smart glasses in ways that were socially unacceptable “glassholes.” Among the social no-nos: Surreptitiously recording others and reading on the device while seeming to ignore others.\n\nAnd while AR glasses have the potential to be helpful in several arenas, including training, education, shopping and gaming, industry analysts said it will be difficult convincing consumers to embrace the devices.\n\n\"Our eyes are very precious real estate,\" said Bajarin, who tried out Snap's AR glasses ahead of their conference. \"Consumers are going to guard that very, very heavily.\"\n\nKeeping the price low enough to entice people to buy will also be a challenge. Meta, which partnered with Ray Ban on a pair of smart glasses that allows people to capture photos, listen to music and take video calls with the help of an AI assistant, sells its device for around $300. Snap has not said what it will charge for its latest glasses should they become available to the public.\n\nRead more:Evan Spiegel: The old man of social media\n\nSnap's glasses remain a work in progress. They’re heavier than regular glasses, heat up to an uncomfortable degree after extended use and the battery life is under an hour. They require foreign hand movements, such as reaching out to pinch digital objects in the air and tapping the front and back of one's hand to adjust the volume or launch a menu.\n\nThe device is powered by Snap's own operating system, giving the company more control over the experience. During a recent preview of the AR glasses held in a San Francisco home, a Times reporter used voice commands to create images that appeared almost instantly — a robot dog, Elsa from Frozen and the San Francisco skyline.\n\nIn another activity, a wide-eyed, yellow creature appeared before making its way outside to a real San Francisco patio with a stunning view of the city. Niantic, the maker of AR game Pokemon Go, created the experience “Peridot Beyond” for Snap’s AR glasses.\n\nAsim Ahmed, who leads global marketing at Niantic, said AR glasses gives the company the opportunity to experiment and design a “new kind of paradigm of gameplay.” What works in a game played on a mobile phone might not work on AR glasses, which offer a wider field of view and don’t rely so heavily on hands to play. Niantic also had to think about safety issues, including making sure the virtual pet doesn’t get too close to their owner and blocks their view.\n\nWith an array of challenges, including figuring out how to jam processing power and other computing hardware into a device that is smaller than a smartphone, analysts predict it will take several years at least before smart glasses gain mainstream adoption, if they ever do.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, shipments of VR and AR headsets dropped 67.4% year-over-year but are expected to improve as consumers transition to new types of devices, according to market intelligence firm IDC. Meta led the market, followed by ByteDance, Xreal and HTC.\n\nWith companies still testing out AR glasses or developing them, a clear front-runner hasn't emerged yet, analysts said.\n\nJacob Bourne, an analyst at eMarketer, said Snap's rivals including Meta and Google have more money to invest in research and development of AR glasses. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has 3.27 billion people use one of their apps every day compared to Snapchat, which has 432 million daily active users.\n\n\"I would probably put my money more on Meta as having the key to the [research and development] capabilities to really get that to market,\" Bourne said. \"But I wouldn't rule Snap out at all.\"\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Google on Tuesday said it would halt plans to develop a major $200 million data center in Chile to address environmental grievances, a decision reflecting growing concerns about the impact of the power-thirsty projects around the world.\n\nThe U.S. technology company first obtained permits in 2020 to construct the vast project in Chile’s capital, Santiago, as demand for the server farms skyrocketed across the globe, fueled by a surge in cloud-based technologies and a craze for generative AI.\n\nBut months after a Chilean court partially reversed the center's authorization over water usage concerns, Google announced Tuesday that it would revise the project to comply with more stringent environmental requirements and change its water-intensive cooling system.\n\n“A new process will start from scratch,” Google said in its statement. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and the way we design and manage our data centers is no exception.”\n\nCommunity complaints in the drought-stricken South American nation over the air-conditioned computer farm's energy and water usage sharpened government scrutiny and prompted a local court to temporarily revoke the project's authorization in February.\n\nThe Santiago environmental court asked Google respond to concerns that the data center could affect Santiago’s main aquifer.\n\nThe court said it was highly possible that cooling the heavy equipment — which creates the online storage for the data of millions — could pull from Chile's water resources. The country is experiencing a crippling drought supercharged by climate change, a source of outrage among locals and Indigenous groups.\n\nGoogle didn't provide an updated timeline for the project and said that it would keep the location the same. It said developers had already notified Chile’s environmental regulator of the company's decision to pause its permit application process and rethink its strategy.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What are share buybacks?",
        "content": "A boom in share buybacks has seen a number of companies using this strategy to return money to investors and boost the value of their stock.\n\nTech company Microsoft (MSFT) has announced a $60bn (£45.4bn) share buyback programme, while also raising its quarterly dividend by 10%.\n\nIt isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" tech company to announce a huge buyback in 2024, with Apple (AAPL) launching a $110bn repurchasing plan and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) also unveiling a $70bn programme. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Facebook-parent Meta (META) have announced $50bn buyback programmes in 2024.\n\nBuybacks have also grown in popularity in the UK, as major London-listed companies such as oil major BP (BP.L) and bank Barclays (BARC.L) have launched their own buyback plans.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nA share repurchase, or share buyback, is when a company rebuys its own shares and returns funds to its investors.\n\nThe issuing company usually acquires its own stock by distributing cash to existing holders, paying the market value per share, in exchange for a portion of the company’s outstanding equity.\n\nRead more: Bank of England bond sales could cost government almost £100bn by 2028\n\nWhen a company repurchases its own shares, this reduces the number of shares held by the public.\n\nCompanies can purchase the stock on the open market or from shareholders directly.\n\nWhy do companies do this?\n\nBuybacks became particularly popular during the Covid pandemic as the economic fallout left companies with mounting debt piles from loans and government bailouts. Repurchasing shares enabled firms to reduce debt, shore up their finances and consolidate ownership.\n\nShare buybacks globally hit a record $1.31tn in 2022, but then dipped back $1.11tn last year, according to Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed that share buybacks were nearing their lowest annual value since 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nThe aggregate value of share buyback transactions for companies trading on major global exchanges through to 9 September 2024 was nearly $164bn, down 35% on the same period last year. That figure was also even lower than the nearly $179bn in buybacks in the comparable period in 2020.\n\nDespite this slowdown in the amount companies are repurchasing, the strategy is still popular, with data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed the number of buybacks is up year-on-year.\n\nRead more: Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia\n\nThere were 983 buyback transactions worldwide this year up to 9 September, up from 823 for the same period last year and the highest number since the first nine months of 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to shoring up finances, buybacks also provide a more flexible way of returning money to shareholders as an alternative to dividends. Public companies have a goal of maximising returns for their investors, so if a firm is generating more cash than it needs to fund its operations, buybacks are a good option for excess cash.\n\nShare repurchases also increase the company’s equity value, and help businesses to look more financially attractive to investors.\n\nIf a board feels that its company’s stock is undervalued, buybacks are one way to solve this, and are often seen as an expression of confidence by the company.\n\nNot only do they provide an additional exit route to shareholders when shares are undervalued or are thinly traded, but also prevent unwelcome takeover bids.\n\nHowever, as they are typically financed with debt, it can sometimes strain cash flow.\n\nHow do they work?\n\nAs share repurchases cut the total number of shares outstanding, and the total amount of cash on the firm’s balance sheet, this affects several metrics used by investors to estimate a company’s valuation.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\nSome of these metrics include earnings per share (EPS), a measure used by investors, and the price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nFewer shares in circulation increases a company’s EPS, and a higher EPS normally means a higher share price.\n\nRecent share repurchases\n\nOutside of the major US tech companies, there have been a number of buyback announcements this year.\n\nBP launched a new buyback of $1.75bn in February, with plans to repurchase at least $14bn in shares over 2024-25.\n\nFellow oil major Shell (SHEL.L) also announced a $3.5bn buyback programme earlier in the year.\n\nBarclays also shared its intention to repurchase a further £750m of its shares in August, as part of plans return at least £10bn in capital to shareholders by 2026 through dividends and buybacks.\n\nAnother bank to declare a buyback was HSBC (HSBA.L), which announced a repurchasing programme of up to $3bn in July.\n\nEuropean banks have also jumped on the trend, with Italy's UniCredit (UCG.MI) initiating its €1.7bn (£1.4bn) repurchasing plan on Monday, while Swiss bank UBS (UBSG.SW) also launched a $2bn programme.\n\nMeanwhile, UK supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L) also committed in April to buying back an additional £1bn worth of shares by April 2025.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. shares have been struggling for the past two months amid mounting regulatory uncertainty.

While most Big Tech names have partially recovered from a summer rotation out of the sector, Alphabet has continued to fall. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market, with Bloomberg News later reporting that a bid to break up the company is one option being considered by the Justice Department.\n\n“Alphabet is the only name in the Magnificent 7 to trade at what we consider a discount, and it is a significant discount,” said Gregg Abella, chief executive officer of Investment Partners Asset Management. “I’m not saying the regulatory issue isn’t a concern, because these cases can go on for a long time and no one knows how to handicap the outcome, but it has presented an opportunity.”\n\nThe share-price drop has left Alphabet trading at around 18 times forward earnings, cementing its place as the cheapest stock among the Magnificent 7. It also trades at a discount to its long-term average and the overall Nasdaq 100 index, which is trading at 25 times. Shares in the search giant edged higher, rising 0.6% on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s getting to the point now where the valuation is starting to overwhelm the overhang,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, who said he bought back some shares in Alphabet last week after trimming his stake about six weeks ago. “I’m feeling much better about getting paid to absorb some of that risk and volatility at the current valuation.”\n\nThe antitrust issues in the US — and in Europe, where Alphabet recently lost a court case over a $2.6 billion fine related to shopping services — have caused some jitters on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley recently cut its Alphabet price target to $190 from $205, saying that antitrust-related uncertainty will put a narrow — and lower — band on the multiple.\n\nEvercore ISI’s Mark Mahaney also cut his price target because of concerns around antitrust trials and potential remedies. Still, Mahaney remains bullish, saying that even in a worst-case scenario where Google is no longer allowed to bid for exclusive search distribution deals in the US, the related reduction in traffic acquisition costs would go a long way to offset this.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Put it this way, Google could lose as much as 60% of its exclusive deal search revenue and still suffer only a single digit percentage loss in EPS,” he wrote, reiterating an outperform rating on the shares.\n\nThe regulatory issue comes as investors increasingly question how much companies like Alphabet are shelling out on AI, and when this spending will begin to pay off. Some investors are also concerned about Google facing more competition from the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. as they try to draw people away from traditional web search and toward chatbots that can answer users’ questions.\n\nThese issues may explain why Alphabet is relatively less liked than some megacap peers. Roughly 83% of analysts recommend buying the stock, compared with rates above 90% Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nStill, Wall Street firms aren’t slashing their estimates on antitrust risk so far. The consensus for Alphabet’s 2025 revenue has risen by 6.6% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, a sign of continued optimism about the company’s prospects despite the risk of antitrust remedies.\n\n“I think the regulatory issue has been priced in,” said Jason Britton, chief investment officer of Reflection Asset Management. “I virtually guarantee it will see more fines, but it has so much cash on its balance sheet that they won’t be material.

        "title": "AppLovin shares rise in pre-open trade on UBS upgrade",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) rose in pre-market trading on Tuesday following an upgrade from UBS, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the company’s medium-term growth prospects.\n\nUBS analysts upgraded AppLovin to a \"buy\" rating from their previous \"neutral\" stance, driven by increased visibility into the company's ability to sustain revenue growth and its favorable valuation.\n\nThe revised 12-month price target was also raised to $145 from $100 per share.\n\nAccording to UBS, the upgrade is based on AppLovin's strong positioning in the digital advertising sector, particularly in gaming.\n\nAppLovin's proprietary ad tech, Axon 2.0, which enhances return on ad spend (ROAS) for advertisers, was identified as a key driver for revenue growth.\n\n“APP's improved relative return on ad-spend (ROAS) vs competing channels is rarely seen in the digital ads space and could support 20-30% software rev growth from gaming alone,” the analysts said, with further long-term growth anticipated from AppLovin’s expansion into the $140 billion e-commerce advertising market​.\n\nUBS analysts believe the company’s valuation, at 13.7x projected FY25 adjusted EBITDA, provides a solid entry point for investors, especially considering the anticipated 20% compound annual growth rate in revenue over the next two years.\n\n“We model FY26 EBITDA margin of 60% vs Street at 58% primarily driven by mix shift. Within the software segment which accounted for 85% of Total EBITDA in FY23 we look for incremental margins to stabilize at ~75% vs Street at 72%,” the analysts said.\n\nAdditionally, UBS analysts flagged that the company’s ability to improve ROAS has led to a shift in advertiser budgets toward AppLovin's platform.\n\nIndustry checks indicated that AppLovin is increasingly becoming the top choice for gaming user acquisition, overtaking competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Unity.\n\nSome advertisers noted that AppLovin is now their largest advertising channel, ahead of even Google​.\n\nUBS believes that AppLovin’s future growth will not be confined to gaming. The expansion of Axon 2.0 beyond gaming to non-gaming verticals, particularly in e-commerce, is expected to drive significant incremental growth.\n\nUBS expects AppLovin to monetize its 1.5 billion daily active users (DAUs) at a higher rate as more non-gaming advertisers come onto the platform.\n\nBy FY26, AppLovin’s software segment is expected to account for a larger share of revenue as the company attracts advertisers from sectors like e-commerce and social media.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at UBS also added that licensing Axon 2.0 to sub-scale advertising platforms could unlock additional growth.\n\nThe partnership with Flip is the first example of this strategy, and UBS projects that similar deals with other platforms could provide 25% upside to FY26 revenue estimates​.\n\nUBS’s new $145 price target reflects 25% upside potential from AppLovin’s current share price of $116.25.\n\nUBS analysts believe the market has not fully priced in the potential of AppLovin's expansion into e-commerce advertising and its ability to capture a larger share of the digital ad market.\n\nShares of the company were up 2.4% in pre-open trade.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAppLovin shares rise in pre-open trade on UBS upgrade\n\nStellantis working hard to avoid Volkswagen plant-closing scenario, CEO says\n\nInstagram rolls out teen account with privacy, parental controls as scrutiny mounts\n\nView comments",

        "content": "I won't keep you in suspense. The five biggest public companies in the world on Jan. 1, 1999, ranked in order from largest to smallest, were:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): $348 billion market cap General Electric(NYSE: GE): $261 billion market cap Intel(NASDAQ: INTC): $197 billion market cap Walmart(NYSE: WMT): $181 billion market cap ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM): $178 billion market cap\n\nHaving said that, there are a few important things to mention. For one thing, 1999 was the height of the dot-com bubble, and there was quite a bit of movement on the list throughout the year. For example, by the end of 1999, Microsoft had reached a market cap of more than $600 billion. Plus, Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) had catapulted its way into the No. 3 spot, while Intel had fallen off it entirely.\n\nThe 5 biggest companies now\n\nAs you might expect given that 25 years have passed since 1999, the list of the largest public companies in the world has changed considerably. Here's where it stands as of Sep. 7, 2024:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.39 trillion Microsoft: $3.00 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): $2.53 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $1.88 trillion Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.78 trillion\n\nMicrosoft is the only company that appears on both lists, and the scale of the players on it has increased by about tenfold. Notably, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total U.S. inflation over that period was only around 92%, so most of that change reflects real growth, not a decline in the value of the dollar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Spanish socialist Teresa Ribera likely to become EU antitrust enforcer, as Ursula von der Leyen names new team",
        "content": "Silicon Valley, meet your likely new European enforcers. On Tuesday morning, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen—recently re-elected by lawmakers—announced her new team, comprising representatives of each EU member state.\n\nIf confirmed by the European Parliament after hearings, these are the people who will propose new EU laws, and in many cases enforce those that are already in place.\n\nFor the tech industry, the most important will probably be Teresa Ribera, who is set to take over from the long-serving Margrethe Vestager as Europe’s antitrust chief.\n\nRibera, a socialist, served as Spain’s vice president and environment minister—and will indeed also be responsible for shepherding the implementation of the EU’s Green Deal.\n\nBut in her antitrust role, she would be responsible for deciding whether Google should be broken up or not.\n\nVestager threatened to force Google to sell some of its ad-tech businesses last year, saying it may be the only way to deal with Google’s monopolistic position on both the buy and sell sides of the online advertising market.\n\nReuters reported Friday that the Commission won’t take such a drastic step, but the decision may now be Ribera’s to make.\n\nIf confirmed, Ribera will also inherit an investigation into the rapidly evolving AI sector.\n\nVestager’s team has been particularly interested in the trend of big AI players hiring top execs from smaller AI companies and licensing their technology, as has happened with Microsoft and Inflection. Some fear that this is a tactic designed to get around the antitrust restrictions on more traditional mergers.\n\nRibera will also be the main enforcer of the Digital Markets Act, a recently enacted law that places strict limitations on the behavior of Big Tech “gatekeepers” like Meta, Google, and Apple—all of which are already subjects of non-compliance probes.\n\nThe Spaniard certainly has big shoes to fill. Vestager has been a groundbreaking competition chief who made tax justice a competition issue by forcing Ireland to claim $14.4 billion in back-taxes from Apple, and who hit Google with three enormous antitrust fines running to a collective $9.3 billion.\n\nThe Dane was not re-nominated by her country due to her liberal party’s dwindling fortunes back home, but she goes out on a high, with the EU’s top court last week upholding both her Apple decision and one of the Google fines. (The court will rule on Google’s appeal in another of those cases on Wednesday.)\n\nMeanwhile, von der Leyen’s tech policy pick is Finland’s Henna Virkkunen, a center-right former communications specialist who has just wrapped up a term as a member of the European Parliament.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of Virkkunen’s chief roles would be to enforce the Digital Services Act, a recent bundle of rules covering content moderation among other things. As a lawmaker, she played a key role in shaping the DSA as it went through the legislative process.\n\nThe DSA has until now been primarily enforced by France’s Thierry Breton, a former CEO of France Telecom who has made waves in the U.S. by regularly sparring with Elon Musk over X’s alleged contravention of the new rulebook.\n\nIndeed, when Breton publicly warned Musk about spreading disinformation in Musk’s interview with former President Donald Trump last month, he didn’t first clear the move with von der Leyen and other colleagues—and reports suggest her resulting outrage is a key reason why she rejected Breton’s re-nomination to the Commission.\n\nX already faces DSA charges and, if confirmed, Virkkunen would also take over formal DSA investigations into Meta and AliExpress.\n\nLeaving Big Tech aside, European startups will also be getting their very first dedicated commissioner, in the form of Bulgaria’s Ekaterina Zaharieva.\n\nStéphane Séjourné, France’s replacement for Breton as Commission nominee, would probably also have an impact on the tech sector as chief of industrial strategy.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Teresa Ribera will have to square up to Big Tech, banks and airlines if confirmed as Europe's new antitrust chief, while juggling calls for looser rules to help create EU champions.\n\nNominated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for the high-profile antitrust post on Tuesday, Ribera has been Spain's minister for ecological transition since 2018.\n\nThe 55-year-old Spanish socialist, one of Europe's most ambitious policymakers on climate change, will have to secure European Parliament approval before taking up her post.\n\nAs competition commissioner, she will be able to approve or veto multi-billion euro mergers or slap hefty fines on companies seeking to bolster their market power by throttling smaller rivals or illegally teaming up to fix prices.\n\nOne of her biggest challenges will be to ensure that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Meta comply with landmark rules aimed at reining in their power and giving consumers more choice.\n\nApple, Google and Meta are firmly in outgoing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crosshairs for falling short of complying with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nAnother challenge will be how to deal with the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence amid concerns about Big Tech leveraging its existing dominance.\n\nRibera may ramp up a crackdown on non-EU state subsidies begun by Vestager aimed at preventing foreign companies from acquiring EU businesses or taking part in EU public tenders with unfair state support.\n\nRecent rulings from Europe's highest court, which backed the Commission's 13 billion euro tax order to Apple, and its 2.42 billion euro antitrust fine against Google, could embolden Ribera to take a tough line against antitrust violations.\n\nThat would mean she would be in no hurry to ease up on antitrust rules, despite Mario Draghi's call to boost EU industrial champions so that they are able to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors.\n\nRibera was also named on Tuesday as executive vice president of a clean, just and competitive energy transition, tasked with ensuring that Europe achieves its green goals.\n\nHer credentials include negotiating deals among EU countries on emissions limits for trucks and a contentious upgrade of EU power market rules last year.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; additional reporting by Marine Strauss and Kate Abnett; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Alexander Smith)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Uh-Oh! Alphabet Is Selling Its Stake in 2 Historically High-Flying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Five weeks ago, what can arguably be described as the most important data release of the third-quarter occurred -- and I'm not talking about the July inflation report.\n\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter (Aug. 14 in the latest instance), institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a clear-cut rundown of which stocks Wall Street's brightest, and often richest, investors bought and sold in the latest quarter. Even though these snapshots are up to 45 days old when filed, it offers invaluable insight into the stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the attention of money managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, 13F filings are a necessity for more than just investment institutions. Some of Wall Street's largest and most-successful companies hold sizable stakes in other businesses, including Nvidia, and are required to file a 13F on a quarterly basis.\n\nOne such company, which has nearly $2 billion invested across 42 stocks, is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent of search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and autonomous ride-hailing service Waymo, among other ventures.\n\nAlphabet is a search engine juggernaut... and much more!\n\nMost investors are familiar with Alphabet because of its world-leading Google search engine.\n\nIn August, Google accounted for a mammoth 90.48% share of worldwide search, per GlobalStats. In fact, Google has held at least a 90% monthly share of global internet search dating back more than nine years. This makes it the undisputed go-to for businesses wanting to target users with their message(s) and affords parent Alphabet unbelievable ad-pricing power.\n\nYou're probably also familiar with YouTube, the second most-visited social media site on the planet, with approximately 2.5 billion monthly active users. The launch of Shorts -- short-form videos lasting 60 seconds or less -- in the latter half of 2020 provided an additional opportunity for the company to capitalize on ad revenue.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Alphabet's Google Cloud is the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform by spending, with 10% of the market, per Canalys, as of the June-ended quarter. Following years of losses, Google Cloud shifted to recurring profits in 2023 and hasn't looked back. Since cloud-service margins often outpace advertising margins, this segment should be a key cash-flow driver for Alphabet throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\nBut Alphabet is also an investor. It has nearly a quarter of its portfolio invested in development, security, and operations software developer GitLab, and more than 16% of invested assets tied up in Arm Holdings. Arm generates its revenue via licenses and royalties from chipmakers that use its designs to produce central processing units, graphics processing units, and other hardware.\n\nHowever, it's not what Alphabet holds that's raising eyebrows. Rather, it's the two core artificial intelligence (AI) stocks it's been selling in consecutive quarters. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe first AI stock Alphabet's investment managers have shown the door in back-to-back quarters is cybersecurity solutions provider CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). After reducing its stake in CrowdStrike by a third during the March-ended quarter, Alphabet slashed its remaining position by another 50% (427,894 shares) in the June-ended quarter. CrowdStrike is now Alphabet's fourth-largest position, down from No. 2, where it began 2024.\n\nValuation is the likely culprit behind this selling activity. Even though CrowdStrike has blown the door off of Wall Street's consensus growth forecasts for years, it was trading at nosebleed price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Locking in gains was likely deemed a prudent move.\n\nThe more recent concern with CrowdStrike -- albeit one that occurred in July, which wouldn't be detailed by the latest round of Form 13Fs -- is a botched update to its Falcon security platform that caused significant downtime for select industries and customers. It's not uncommon for these snafus to cost cybersecurity companies revenue in the short run.\n\nOn the bright side, CrowdStrike's error was self-inflicted and had nothing to do with a cyberattack. Prior to this July outage, businesses had demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for CrowdStrike's services given its history of protecting against breaches.\n\nWhat's more, CrowdStrike has mastered the art of the add-on sale within the cybersecurity arena. In less than seven years, it went from a single-digit percentage of its customers purchasing four or more cloud-module subscriptions to 65% of its clients using five or more cloud modules, as of the July ended quarter.\n\nThe cherry on top for CrowdStrike is that cybersecurity solutions have evolved into a basic need service. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing, businesses with an online or cloud-based presence need to protect their data.\n\nWith the cloud-native Falcon platform only growing more effective over time, thanks to AI, Alphabet's brightest investment minds may regret their decision to sell a collective two-thirds of their stake in CrowdStrike.\n\nDexCom\n\nThe other AI stock that Alphabet's investment team has been dumping for two straight quarters is medical-device giant DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM). After shedding slightly north of 51% of its stake in the maker of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) in the first quarter, Alphabet sold another 42.1% of its position (753,836 shares) in the second quarter. This former No. 1 holding of Alphabet has slipped to No. 6 and now accounts for about 6% of invested assets.\n\nSimilar to CrowdStrike, valuation has long been the glaring red flag with DexCom. Although it's been growing sales at a relatively steady rate of around 20% for years, DexCom's P/S and forward P/E ratios have always been eyebrow-raising.\n\nThe more-pressing concern of late for DexCom is what might happen to its business as a result of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist drugs hitting the market. GLP-1 therapies have been shown to reduce weight in patients taking them, and obesity is a common co-morbidity for people with diabetes. Although studies have shown that patients on GLP-1 drugs are more likely to use CGMs, DexCom's second-quarter operating results, which were reported in July (i.e., after 13Fs were filed), did little to quell these concerns.\n\nDexCom lost 40% of its value in the blink of an eye after lowering the midpoint of its full-year sales guidance by about $250 million and highlighting a laundry list of challenges during the quarter. CEO Kevin Sayer pointed to lower revenue per user and the company restructuring its sales team as key reasons for this shortfall. In particular, Sayer believes a lack of sales team coverage in select geographic areas led to the company's new patient count coming up short.\n\nIf there's a silver lining here, it's that DexCom is one of the two leading providers of CGM devices, and should, in theory, benefit from the sheer number of people diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. and worldwide climbing.\n\nDexCom can also lean on its various AI solutions to differentiate itself and provide value to its users. This includes everything from glucose control for its infusion pumps to helping users with dietary assessments to optimize their blood glucose levels.\n\nBut the nature of DexCom's earnings miss is concerning, to say the least. Color me not surprised if Alphabet continues to purge DexCom from its investment portfolio in the September-ended quarter.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Nvidia, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft Could Help This Stock-Split ETF Turn $200,000 Into $1 Million",
        "content": "Roughly 70% of top executives believe artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the way their organizations create value over the next three years, according to a survey by consulting firm PwC published earlier this year. In PwC's report, it projects AI technology will add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\n\nEvents like the dot-com boom and bust in the late 1990s and early 2000s suggest that picking winners and losers in new industries like AI won't be easy. Not every AI company will survive, let alone thrive. That's why buying an AI-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) can be a great option for investors. It can offer exposure to a broad variety of AI stocks neatly packaged into one security, and it is far less susceptible to catastrophic losses if one or two fail.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF(NYSEMKT: IGM) owns 281 different stocks, but it holds a high concentration of the most popular AI names. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe iShares ETF recently completed a stock split\n\nThe iShares ETF delivered a compound annual return of 20.2% over the last 10 years, crushing the 13.2% average annual gain in the S&P 500 index over the same period.\n\nThe powerful returns propelled the ETF to a price per share of more than $510 in March, which made it somewhat inaccessible to smaller investors. As a result, iShares executed a 6-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation sixfold and organically reduced the price per share by a proportional amount. Now, investors can buy the ETF for roughly $92.\n\nThe ETF has large holdings in leading AI stocks like Meta Platforms, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, which are likely to continue driving its gains. Here's how those stocks can help this ETF turn a $200,000 investment into $1 million over the long term -- but don't worry, investors with any starting balance can earn a fivefold return if this scenario plays out.\n\nEvery popular technology stock, packed into one ETF\n\nAs I mentioned at the top, the iShares ETF holds 281 different stocks. It was established in 2001 so it has helped investors navigate several technology cycles from the internet to cloud computing to enterprise software.\n\nAI is the dominant theme in the tech sector right now. The top four holdings in the iShares ETF account for 34.3% of the total value of its entire portfolio, and each of them has a dominant presence in AI:\n\nStock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Meta Platforms 9.01% 2. Apple 8.99% 3. Microsoft 8.36% 4. Nvidia 7.94%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Sept. 12, 2024, and are subject to change.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms might be a social media giant, but it has also built the most popular open-source large language model (LLM), called Llama. It's at the foundation of new AI features on Facebook and Instagram like Meta AI, a chatbot that can answer complex questions and generate images. Llama will enable the company to roll out AI agents for businesses in the future, which will be capable of handling incoming messages from customers, and potentially even processing sales.\n\nApple recently developed Apple Intelligence in partnership with OpenAI, which will launch on the iOS 18 operating system later this year. It will give iPhone, iPad, and Mac users new writing tools that can rapidly summarize and generate text content for messages and emails. Plus, the Siri voice assistant will be upgraded with the knowledge of ChatGPT, making it more capable than ever before. With 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, Apple could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nMicrosoft is a multifaceted AI company. It developed a virtual assistant called Copilot, which is embedded in many of its flagship software products like Windows, 365 (Word, PowerPoint, and Excel), Edge, and Bing. Microsoft is also a leading provider of AI services through its Azure cloud platform. Businesses can access ready-made LLMs on Azure to help them deploy AI into their operations, and they can also tap into Microsoft's data centers to develop their own AI applications.\n\nFinally, none of the above would be possible without Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center. The company can't keep up with demand for its chips, which is driving a surge in its revenue and earnings. That trend looks set to continue for at least the next year as Nvidia begins shipping a new generation of GPUs based on its Blackwell architecture, which will enable developers to create the most advanced AI apps to date.\n\nOutside of those top four holdings, the iShares ETF has positions in a number of other important AI stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Oracle, and Advanced Micro Devices. But it also owns small stakes in leading technology stocks like Netflix, Salesforce, and Palo Alto Networks, which are using AI even though it isn't their core product.\n\nTurning $200,000 into $1 million\n\nThe iShares ETF has generated a compound annual return of 10.9% since its inception in 2001. As I touched on earlier, it delivered an accelerated annual return of 20.2% over the last 10 years, because that's the period in which technologies like the smartphone, cloud computing, enterprise software, and AI experienced widespread adoption.\n\nThe below table shows how long it could take the ETF to turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million based on a range of returns:\n\nStarting Balance Compound Annual Return Time to Reach $1 Million $200,000 10.9% 16 years $200,000 15.5% (midpoint) 12 years $200,000 20.2% 9 years\n\nCalculations by author.\n\nIt will be extremely difficult for the ETF to sustain a return of more than 20% over the long term. Its top four holdings have a combined market capitalization of $10.8 trillion, and each one is likely to experience decelerating revenue growth over time because of its sheer size. Meta, for example, already has 3.2 billion daily active users, so the company will inevitably hit a growth ceiling unless the world's population expands significantly. Apple and Microsoft are in similar positions, serving at least 1 billion customers each already.\n\nHowever, even if the ETF reverts back to its average annual gain of 10.9%, it can still deliver a fivefold return for investors over 16 years. The ETF could unlock greater returns if new tech companies emerge and create significant value, or if the AI industry becomes larger than firms like PwC expect (which is a real possibility).\n\nBut the reverse is also true. If AI fails to live up to the hype, stocks like Meta, Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft could suffer declines that will drive a period of poor performance for the iShares ETF. That's a good argument for owning the ETF as part of a balanced portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Walmart WMT, Procter & Gamble PG and Coca-Cola KO, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Oracle’s ORCL and Nvidia’s NVDA.\n\nTech Stocks Are Cheap, Value Expensive: A Rare Opportunity?\n\nIn recent months, we've witnessed a significant rotation in the stock market, with investors gravitating toward defensive, value-oriented stocks as they brace for an economic slowdown and potential shifts in interest rate policy.\n\nThis flight to safety has caused many value stocks—traditionally considered stable but slow-growing—to become highly sought after, driving their valuations higher. At the same time, tech stocks, known for their growth potential, have seen their prices drop, creating an unusual dynamic where some of the market’s most innovative companies are now trading at lower relative valuations.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity for investors. While value stocks like Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola have been bid up due to their perceived safety, tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms are now priced very attractively. Despite their lower valuations, these tech companies still have superior growth prospects, making this a rare moment where investors can acquire high-growth stocks at a discount, while more defensive stocks have become relatively expensive.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore how this market dynamic has unfolded and why tech’s current pricing could be an opportunity you don’t want to miss.\n\nDefensive Stocks Have Led the Market\n\nIf you have been following my recent write-ups you will know that I have been talking about this rotation for some time now. Below we can see that defensive ETFs such as Value, Healthcare and Utilities have held up better than Tech and the broad market over the last few months.\n\nWhile it has been a good ride for those that were early in the trend, I am not sure this theme will continue much longer. In the chart above, we can see how stark the comparative valuations are now, with the tech stocks trading lower forward multiples than the value stocks.\n\nHowever, the narrative has begun to shift and after several months of consolidation, tech stocks appear primed for the next leg higher. In addition to the now attractive valuations, chatter and activity surrounding Artificial Intelligence is picking up again, which should lure investors back to tech. Apple just released its newest AI enabled iPhones and Oracle’s Larry Ellison is talking about building thousands of new data centers. Ellison also said that at a dinner recently with Elon Musk and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, that he and Elon were begging Jensen for more GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Growth Forecasts: Tech vs. Value\n\nWhen we compare the earnings growth projections for tech to value the disparity is striking. Over the next 3-5 years, tech stocks are expected to deliver far superior earnings growth.\n\nAlphabet: Analysts project GOOGL to achieve 17.5% annual EPS growth over the next few years. This growth is driven by the company’s dominance in digital advertising, its strong position in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and its thriving cloud services segment through Google Cloud. Meta Platforms: META is forecasted to grow its earnings at an even more impressive rate of 19% annually. This growth comes from its continuing dominance in social media advertising, its shift to AI-enhanced tools for advertising and user engagement. Walmart: On the other hand, retail giant Walmart is expected to grow its EPS at a much more modest rate of 8.2%. While Walmart has invested heavily in e-commerce and technology to adapt to changing consumer habits, it still faces slower growth due to its mature market and tight margins in retail. Procter & Gamble: A defensive stock like PG, known for its household consumer products, has an EPS growth forecast of 6.6%. While PG offers steady earnings, its growth prospects are limited by its reliance on mature markets and a slower pace of innovation compared to tech. Coca-Cola: Finally, Coca-Cola’s expected growth rate of 6.3% reflects its role as a staple in the consumer staples sector. KO’s focus on beverages, while lucrative and reliable, doesn’t offer the same explosive growth potential as tech companies operating in rapidly evolving industries like AI and digital media.\n\nShould Investors Buy GOOGL and META Stock?\n\nGrowth forecasts clearly favor tech stocks like GOOGL and META. Their earnings are expected to compound at rates more than double that of traditional value stocks like WMT, PG, and KO. This highlights a key point: while value stocks provide stability, their limited growth potential makes them less attractive for investors seeking high returns over the long term. On top of that, tech stocks now offer better relative valuations following the recent rotation into defensive stocks, making them an even more compelling buy.\n\nFor example, GOOGL and META, despite their higher growth potential, currently trade at forward P/E multiples lower than their historical averages, as investors have become more cautious on tech. Meanwhile, WMT, PG, and KO, with slower growth prospects, are trading at elevated P/E ratios compared to their historical norms, as investors have flocked to these defensive names amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThis unusual dynamic presents a rare opportunity for investors. Buying tech stocks with high growth potential at attractive valuations can offer a combination of both growth and value. On the flip side, while value stocks provide near-term safety, they may be fully priced, with limited upside left if growth fails to materialize.\n\nFor investors, the key takeaway is that tech stocks are offering a better balance of growth potential and reasonable valuations, while value stocks, despite their recent popularity, may be nearing their upside potential.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "12 Countries Millionaires Are Moving To",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 12 countries millionaires are moving to. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Countries Millionaires Are Moving To.\n\nThe global millionaires accounted for almost 1.5% of the adult population in 2023. A lot of millionaires are moving to tax-free countries in the world. The United States has the highest millionaire population, at around 22 million, representing 38% of the total millionaires in the world. This makes the United States the country with the highest percentage of millionaires in the world. In 2023, China had the second-highest number of millionaires, with just over 6 million. However, China is expected to experience the highest millionaire outflow in 2024, with over 15,000 leaving the country. The United Kingdom, which takes the third spot with the most millionaires is projected to have the second-highest millionaire outflow in 2024.\n\nAccording to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report 2024, the number of millionaires is expected to be grow in 52 countries out of 56 countries worldwide. By 2028, Taiwan is anticipated to experience the highest increase by over 50%. Next on the list are Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea which are expected to have millionaire growth of 43%, 37%, 32%, 28%, and  27%, respectively. The global wealth share for emerging economies is expected to cross 30% in 2024 and reach nearly 32% by 2028.\n\nMillionaire Migration and Its Impact\n\nMillionaires migrate due to several reasons such as business opportunities, safety, financial concerns, lifestyle factors, education opportunities for children, better healthcare system, standard of living, and taxes and retirement. According to a report by New World Wealth, nearly 128,000 millionaires around the world are expected to move to a new country in 2024, with the United Arab Emirates leading the list with a 3-year average of 5,067 millionaires moving to the country. Whereas, Taiwan, Turkiye, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea are expected to have the highest millionaire population growth by 2028.\n\nScott Galloway, a public speaker, entrepreneur, and host of The Prof G Show on YouTube, highlighted that the influx of millionaires in the Middle East, especially Dubai and Saudi Arabia is due to increasing economic opportunity and low taxes. The Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are some of the most popular tax havens for the wealthy. Portugal is another major destination for millionaires offering Golden visa opportunities for wealthy people, said Galloway. According to La Vida’s recent investment migration survey, almost 31% of respondents indicated that they are considering a Golden Visa programme to have security against political uncertainties. Whereas, over 23% opted for relocation as their primary reason.\n\nThe millionaires' migration is a huge bonus for countries millionaires are moving to. The migration of wealth and talent to these countries adds exclusive benefits to the economy. For instance, millionaires are a major source of forex revenue as they tend to move their capital with them. An entrepreneur who brings $10 million with them is equivalent to a country generating $10 million in export revenue. Millionaires also invest in the local stock market to diversify their equity portfolio, which increases the country’s foreign portfolio investment (FPI).\n\nAlmost 20% of the high-net-worth individuals are company founders, who establish businesses in their new country which leads to the creation of local jobs. In addition, nearly 60% of centi-millionaires and billionaire entrepreneurs create local jobs through their businesses. Out of Fortune 500 companies in 2024, 230 companies were founded by ‘New Americans,’ who are immigrants or the children of immigrants. These immigrant-founded companies made a staggering $8.6 trillion in revenue in 2023, higher than some of the largest economies in the world such as Japan, Germany, Russia, and Indonesia. These 230 companies employed more than 15.5 million people worldwide, reflecting their significance for creating jobs and economic growth.\n\nREAD ALSO: 30 Least Peaceful Countries in the World and 12 Countries With Best Moody’s Credit Rating For Sovereign Bonds.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the leading tech companies that was co-founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Sergery Brin who co-founded Google with Larry Page immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six in 1979. Along with Page, Brin took the browsing network to the next level with the Google browser. Today, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the largest companies in the world with a market capitalization of $1.94 trillion, as of September 13.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a leading tech giant that primarily earns revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Alphabet Inc. also operates in lucrative industries such as video streaming and cloud computing. However, the company’s premier business is dependent on Search. During the second quarter of 2024, Alphabet Inc. reported a total revenue of $84.74 billion, beating estimates by $445.49 million and up by almost 14% year-over-year. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s revenue from Search was almost $48.50 billion, while the other Google services added around $25.42 billion to the revenue. Google Cloud business is the second largest source of revenue for Alphabet Inc., adding around $10.34 billion to the total revenue in Q2 2024. The company surpassed its earnings estimate as well, reporting an EPS of $1.89 compared to a consensus of $1.84 per share. Patient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first-quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding), and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising, and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long term, with Google being well-positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nThe company’s sizable business in the ‘Search’ allows it to control over 50% of the search advertising market. This allows Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) significant leverage with publishers and advertising firms to divert their transactions through its platform. Moreover, Google’s AI model ‘Gemini’ places Alphabet Inc. at the forefront of AI developments.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the 12 countries millionaires are moving to. 12 Countries Millionaires Are Moving to\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 12 countries millionaires are moving to, we gathered the data of countries with the highest millionaire inflow in 2023 and 2024.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Among Cantor Fitzgerald’s Top Internet Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\n\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\n\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\n\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\n\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\n\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\n\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\n\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\n\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 165\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 22%\n\nCantor's Rating: Neutral\n\nCantor's Share Price Target: $190\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the leading technology companies in the world, and it owes its success to the Google Search search engine. This has allowed it to have a fortress balance sheet, as evidenced by $111 billion of cash and equivalents, through Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s dominance in the advertising market through which it serves as an intermediary between publishers and advertisers and also offers ad spots on its search engine. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s resources and tech focused nature have also made it into a key AI player and one of the few companies with a foundational AI model in the form of Gemini. Gemini allows Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build AI products and services, and it also enables the company to offer AI products to others. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s tensor processing units (TPUs) are among the leading AI chips in the industry; so much so that they've enticed Apple to use them for Apple Intelligence. However, headwinds in the form of regulatory action against Search persist and could knock the wind out of the firm in the not so distant future.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 8th on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Hong Kong Considers Rules for AI Use in Finance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Hong Kong government is preparing to issue its maiden policy statement on the use of artificial intelligence in finance, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could catalyze the use of the technology in areas from trading to investment banking and cryptocurrencies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPipeline Fire Near Houston Forces Some Residents to Evacuate Housing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nThe city’s Financial Services and Treasury Bureau plans to issue a framework of guidelines to touch on the ethical use of AI and general principles for applying the technology in the finance world, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Officials are still drafting the document while getting feedback from the industry, the people said. Details are still subject to change in the coming weeks, they said.\n\nWhile specifics remain unclear, the document is broadly intended to signal Hong Kong’s support for AI, as governments around the world come to grips with the technology’s potential. Local regulators are also trying to resolve some of the confusion around AI in Hong Kong, a city that’s caught up in the US-Chinese technology conflict. Many consumers and corporations can’t easily access some of the hottest services from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Google’s Gemini, because US tech leaders are likely nervous about running afoul of the Chinese territory’s rules, analysts say.\n\nOfficials expect to unveil their statement around late October during Fintech Week, one of the industry’s most important annual gatherings.\n\n“The government and the financial regulators are closely monitoring market developments and global experiences in order to promote the responsible use of AI in the financial industry,” a spokesman for the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau said in a statement. “The government will issue a policy statement later this year, setting out its policy stance and approach on the application of AI in the financial market.”\n\nHong Kong wants to re-position the affluent city as a financial center, as foreign investors grow nervous about Beijing’s growing control and consider alternative locations such as Singapore. The Southeast Asian nation has forged ahead in crafting guidance on everything from crypto to fintech and AI.\n\nAt the same time, Wall Street is exploring ways AI might reshape financial firms’ operations. Banks globally have been advertising to lure AI talent and are using emerging technologies for tasks such as examining client portfolios and looking for potential defaulters.\n\nStory continues\n\nA policy statement would provide broad direction and wouldn’t be immediately enforceable. Still, such statements have become a popular way for the Hong Kong administration to declare its commitment to new and competitive policy areas such as Web3 and family offices. The anticipated statement suggests regulators will adopt a favorable attitude toward AI applications and will later release more concrete rules, the people said.\n\nThe policy statement is intended also to consolidate various detailed guidance from individual banking and securities regulators, according to the people. It will be a separate effort from the government’s technology bureau, which is focused on developing its own AI tools, they added.\n\nSome Hong Kong financiers have recently become anxious about the difficulty tapping into such services, along with regulatory uncertainties about their usage by companies, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThis Global Financial Capital Is an AI No Man’s Land: Tech Daily\n\nAmerican companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google don’t make their chatbots available here, while those from Chinese tech giants like Baidu Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. can be difficult or impossible to use.\n\nThere are workarounds, however. One major US provider, Microsoft Corp, makes its tools accessible in the city. And other means such as VPNs, or virtual private networks, can be used to disguise users’ locations in order to access chatbots.\n\nThe city’s Securities and Futures Commission updated guidelines on using external data storage providers last year to cover public and private cloud services, virtual and conventional data centers.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the government-backed technology hub Cyberport started a regulatory sandbox in August for banks to try out new Gen AI use cases. It’s unclear when regulations would permit such applications to be used in real-world cases. The new AI guidelines are expected to provide unified rules and clarity on such uses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia's AI Surge Powers 25% of S&P 500 Gains in 2024, Makes Co-founder Huang Among Fastest Growing: Report\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally disproportionately influences the S&P 500 index, reflecting concerns over the domino effect due to the integrated semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nNvidia accounted for 25% of the S&P 500’s 17% gain in 2024, Reuters reports.\n\nThe chip designer has risen by 166% in the last 12 months as Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), splurge on their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Gains Ground in AI Chip Market, Oracle Exec Confirms Growing Demand: Report\n\nThe rising valuation of NvidiaNVIDIA in 2024 has helped boost the wealth of Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of the company that was once created inside a Denny’s restaurant.\n\nHuang has a wealth of $90.5 billion, ranking 18th according to Bloomberg. While Huang hasn’t cracked the top 10 list yet and would currently need to hit a wealth of $130 billion, the Nvidia co-founder is one of the fastest risers among the world’s richest people. Huang’s wealth is up $46.4 billion year-to-date in 2024.\n\nThat figure is more than the combined $41.83 billion gained by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Musk, Bezos and Gates currently rank first, second and fifth, respectively, with their current wealth and year-to-date gains.\n\nElon Musk: $237 billion, +$7.73 billion year-to-date Jeff Bezos: $195 billion, +$17.9 billion year-to-date Bill Gates: $157 billion, +$16.2 billion year-to-date\n\nThe gain by Huang is one of the largest year-to-date gains, trailing only Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is up $49.9 billion and listed fourth at $178 billion.\n\nIt’s not just personal wealth – due to the AI frenzy, Huang expects hyper-scale customers to produce $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia’s infrastructure. He also reiterated that Blackwell-based products will ship in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia stock losing value would impact the S&P500 and Huang’s wealth. However, Huang had snubbed geopolitical tensions surrounding supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), voicing the possibility of switching suppliers.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia have a combined weighting of 20% in the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 31%, and Apple has risen 22% in the last 12 months as they remain invested in their AI goals.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia and the S&P 500 through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 1.95% to $116.78 on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s Strong August Sales Hint at Big Gains Ahead, AI and iPhone Demand Fuel Optimism\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Alphabet (GOOGL) reached $158.06, with a +0.38% movement compared to the previous day. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.13%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.55%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.52%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 3.38% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.56%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.67%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.83, reflecting a 18.06% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $72.77 billion, reflecting a 13.61% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.63 per share and revenue of $292.3 billion. These totals would mark changes of +31.55% and +13.95%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher. Alphabet is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Alphabet is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.63. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 30.5, so one might conclude that Alphabet is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nAlso, we should mention that GOOGL has a PEG ratio of 1.18. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. GOOGL's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.23 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 87, this industry ranks in the top 35% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) a Good Big Tech Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other big tech stocks.\n\nThe State of Big Tech Right Now\n\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\n\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of  AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\n\nHow Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors?\n\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\n\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\n\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another reputable big tech player on the market, more familiarly known as Google. It is based in Mountain View, California.\n\nGoogle Search and Google Cloud are some of the top-performing segments operated by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the former representing about 57% of the company's revenue in the second quarter and the latter garnering analyst attention recently for becoming more profitable. However, many investors are more interested in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) because it owns YouTube, a highly successful video platform.\n\nIn the second quarter, YouTube generated $8.7 billion in ad revenue alone, up 13% year-over-year. Google Cloud has also seen revenues soar by 29% to over $10 billion in the second quarter - showing the business' fast pace of growth. In light of all this, the biggest challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) seems to be facing is the recent antitrust case it lost against the US government, where the company was called a monopoly.\n\nMany are concerned that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be broken up as a result of this ruling. But realistically speaking, this doesn't seem all that easy to accomplish when you're dealing with a tech giant. Regardless of what happens in the aftermath, the individual successes of all of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) business segments are enough to assure investors of the company's success and further growth in the future.\n\nWe saw 216 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $35.3 billion.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "AMZN, GOOGL, or MSFT: Which Cloud Computing Giant Is the Best Pick?",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks have surged amid widespread adoption that’s being driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, I will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to evaluate the three biggest players in the sector: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Although I consider all three stocks a Buy, Amazon stands out as the best investment based on its cloud business.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nI rate Amazon a Buy largely because of its position as the undisputed leader in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds a 31% market share. Under CEO Andy Jassy, the company has shifted its focus to higher-margin services, scaling AI across AWS and lessening its reliance on first-party retail sales.\n\nAWS is arguably Amazon’s most important business unit, boasting an impressive operating profit margin of 35.5%. Although the current margin is down slightly from 37.6% in the previous quarter, it remains nearly 40 times more profitable than Amazon’s international segment, which has operating margins of 0.9%.\n\nAWS supports open-source projects and tools, and is popular for its flexibility, scalable infrastructure, and AI services. As enterprises increasingly adopt open-source models, AWS could gain a competitive edge and better protect its market share. AWS’ net sales growth has accelerated from 12% to 19% over the past four quarters, with Q2 2024 revenues reaching $26.3 billion and an annual run rate of $105.2 billion.\n\nIs AMZN Stock A Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nThe consensus among Wall Street analysts is that AMZN stock is a Strong Buy. Currently, 42 of 43 analysts rate the stock a Buy. There is one Hold rating on the stock and no Sell ratings. The average price target of $222.88 suggests potential upside of 20.68% based on the current share price.\n\nBank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post points to the upcoming 2025 partnership between Oracle’s (ORCL) databases and AWS applications, which could drive increased demand for cloud infrastructure and applications using Oracle’s databases—an area where the two companies previously competed.\n\nRead more analyst ratings of AMZN stock\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nMy bullish stance on Alphabet is based on the rapid growth of Google Cloud and its improving margins. Currently, Google Cloud holds an 11% share of the cloud computing market. However, it is the fastest-growing among the three major players.\n\nOne of Google Cloud’s key strengths is its integration with other Google services, such as AI-driven applications and Google Workspace. This synergy enables Google Cloud to offer a strong suite of solutions in areas such as automation, cybersecurity, and productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q2 of this year, Google Cloud’s revenue increased 29% to $10.3 billion, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. However, Alphabet’s Cloud segment reported operating margins of 11.3% last quarter. While this was an improvement, it is still significantly lower than AWS’ margin of 35.5%. Enhancing these margins should be a top priority at Alphabet.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock A Buy Or Sell?\n\nWall Street is also bullish on Alphabet. The consensus view is that GOOGL stock is a Strong Buy, with 27 out of 36 analysts saying the shares are a Buy. The other nine analysts rate the stock a Hold. There are no Sell ratings on the stock currently. The average price target of $203.72 implies upside potential of 29% from current levels.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) analyst Eric Sheridan highlights that Alphabet’s focus on balancing growth with cost discipline should lead to steady margin expansion within the cloud segment.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on GOOGL stock\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nI also rate Microsoft’s stock a Buy based on the success of the company’s Azure cloud unit. Azure’s market share has steadily grown to 25%, making it Amazon’s closest competitor. This growth is largely attributed to Microsoft’s strong enterprise relationships. Azure’s integration with Microsoft’s other enterprise products—such as Office 365, Dynamics, and LinkedIn—makes it an attractive option for businesses that already use Microsoft’s ecosystem.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Azure’s growth slowed in the company’s most recent quarter. The server products and cloud services revenue category reached $28.5 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year increase. That growth was slower than the 24% annualized increase recorded in the previous quarter and negatively impacted Microsoft’s overall earnings.\n\nMicrosoft was the only major player in the cloud sector to experience a slowdown in revenue growth, while AWS and Google Cloud grew their revenues. Regardless, Microsoft still leads its peers with the highest operating margins, boasting an impressive 45%.\n\nIs MSFT A Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish on Microsoft, giving the stock a consensus Strong Buy rating. Currently, 29 out of 30 analysts rate the stock a Buy. The other analyst rates it a Hold. As with Amazon and Alphabet, there are no Sell ratings on Microsoft’s stock. The average price target of $501.15 suggests potential upside of 16.3%.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Keith Weiss points out that Azure is growing faster when considered separately from other Microsoft services. He expects Azure to experience significant growth in the second half of this year due to reduced capacity constraints.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on MSFT stock\n\nConclusion – Amazon Web Services Is the Best Choice\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud service boasts the best operating margins, despite a slowdown in growth in the last quarter. Google Cloud, while having the lowest operating margins and smallest market share, is experiencing the fastest growth. However, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands out with the biggest market share, strong operating margins, and accelerating growth. Given Amazon’s sizable cloud ecosystem and strong financial metrics, it represents the strongest investment opportunity in cloud computing today.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft bringing more AI technology to its productivity software as it works to monetize investments",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is pouring more of its AI-powered Copilot technology into its Microsoft 365 productivity products, including Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The updates, which include the ability to use Copilot to draft PowerPoint presentations and a feature that prioritizes your emails in Outlook, are a part of what the tech giant refers to as its Copilot Wave 2 rollout.\n\nIn addition to the improvements to its Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft also announced a new collaborative tool called Copilot Pages, which lets teams of workers access, edit, and manipulate data on a single page using information pulled from Copilot.\n\nThe company also debuted a new agent builder option that lets users easily create Copilot-powered agents, AI assistants designed to automate and executive business processes.\n\nThe moves are all a part of Microsoft’s broader efforts to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space ranging from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Salesforce (CRM) and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a showcase event of the company's AI assistant, Copilot, ahead of the annual Build developer conference at Microsoft headquarters, Monday, May 20, 2024, in Redmond, Wash. (AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMicrosoft says the number of customers using Copilot increased more than 60% quarter over quarter and that the number of people who use it daily at work doubled. What’s more, the Windows maker says Vodafone is purchasing 68,000 Copilot licenses for its 100,000 employees after it found that the software helped workers save an average of three hours per week per person.\n\nThe new Copilot features for Microsoft’s 365 apps are all designed to help improve worker efficiency, whether that means tracking meeting transcripts and chats to make it easier to catch up or quickly adding references to documents, PDFs, and emails in a Word document.\n\nThe Copilot agent builder for Copilot Studio, meanwhile, is designed to help put together an AI-powered agent that fits your company’s needs without needing much technical know-how.\n\n“One of the things which we heard very consistently was ... it's not one size fits all when it comes to Copilot,” Charles Lamanna, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of business and industry Copilot, told Yahoo Finance. Microsoft's Copilot agent builder is designed to make it easier for workers to create their own AI-powered agents. (Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\n“If you have this company and this company, say, Disney versus Novartis, what they want to do in Microsoft 365 with Copilot is going to be slightly different. They have different data sources, they have different workflows, they have different processes. They have just … different ways of working.”\n\nThat’s where Microsoft’s agent builder comes in. Say, for example, you want to make it easier for new employees to better understand their health benefits. You can use Copilot Studio to tell an agent to answer questions about your company’s healthcare offerings and point it to any relevant documents.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a worker uses the agent, it will automatically pull data from those documents, providing them with the information they need without having to scour multiple microsites and digital pamphlets.\n\n“Everyone in a company will be able to create agents and to use agents,” Lamanna said.\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot software is a major part of its broader push into the generative AI space, which includes investing in ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and is at least part of the reason the company’s stock price is up more than 30% over the last 12 months. Rival and Google parent Alphabet’s stock is up 14% in the same period.\n\nDuring its most recent earnings report, Microsoft announced that its Intelligent Cloud segment revenue, which includes Azure services, was $28.5 billion. That was just short of Wall Street’s expectation of $28.7 billion. And while that was a 19% year-over-year revenue increase, investors reacted negatively to the news, sending shares lower following the earnings announcement.

        "title": "Tech Stocks are Cheap and Value is Expensive: A Rare Opportunity?",
        "content": "In recent months, we've witnessed a significant rotation in the stock market, with investors gravitating toward defensive, value-oriented stocks as they brace for an economic slowdown and potential shifts in interest rate policy.\n\nThis flight to safety has caused many value stocks—traditionally considered stable but slow-growing—to become highly sought after, driving their valuations higher. At the same time, tech stocks, known for their growth potential, have seen their prices drop, creating an unusual dynamic where some of the market’s most innovative companies are now trading at lower relative valuations.\n\nThis presents a unique opportunity for investors. While value stocks like Walmart (WMT), Procter & Gamble (PG), and Coca-Cola (KO) have been bid up due to their perceived safety, tech giants like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are now priced very attractively. Despite their lower valuations, these tech companies still have superior growth prospects, making this a rare moment where investors can acquire high-growth stocks at a discount, while more defensive stocks have become relatively expensive.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore how this market dynamic has unfolded and why tech’s current pricing could be an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDefensive Stocks Have Led the Market\n\nIf you have been following my recent write-ups you will know that I have been talking about this rotation for some time now. Below we can see that defensive ETFs such as Value, Healthcare and Utilities have held up better than Tech and the broad market over the last few months.\n\nWhile it has been a good ride for those that were early in the trend, I am not sure this theme will continue much longer. In the chart above, we can see how stark the comparative valuations are now, with the tech stocks trading lower forward multiples than the value stocks.\n\nHowever, the narrative has begun to shift and after several months of consolidation, tech stocks appear primed for the next leg higher. In addition to the now attractive valuations, chatter and activity surrounding Artificial Intelligence is picking up again, which should lure investors back to tech. Apple (AAPL) just released its newest AI enabled iPhones and Oracle’s (ORCL) Larry Ellison is talking about building thousands of new data centers. Ellison also said that at a dinner recently with Elon Musk and Nvidia’s (NVDA) Jensen Huang, that he and Elon were begging Jensen for more GPUs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nComparative Growth Forecasts: Tech vs. Value\n\nWhen we compare the earnings growth projections for tech to value the disparity is striking. Over the next 3-5 years, tech stocks are expected to deliver far superior earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL): Analysts project GOOGL to achieve 17.5% annual EPS growth over the next few years. This growth is driven by the company’s dominance in digital advertising, its strong position in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and its thriving cloud services segment through Google Cloud. Meta Platforms (META): META is forecasted to grow its earnings at an even more impressive rate of 19% annually. This growth comes from its continuing dominance in social media advertising, its shift to AI-enhanced tools for advertising and user engagement. Walmart (WMT): On the other hand, retail giant Walmart is expected to grow its EPS at a much more modest rate of 8.2%. While Walmart has invested heavily in e-commerce and technology to adapt to changing consumer habits, it still faces slower growth due to its mature market and tight margins in retail. Procter & Gamble (PG): A defensive stock like PG, known for its household consumer products, has an EPS growth forecast of 6.6%. While PG offers steady earnings, its growth prospects are limited by its reliance on mature markets and a slower pace of innovation compared to tech. Coca-Cola (KO): Finally, Coca-Cola’s expected growth rate of 6.3% reflects its role as a staple in the consumer staples sector. KO’s focus on beverages, while lucrative and reliable, doesn’t offer the same explosive growth potential as tech companies operating in rapidly evolving industries like AI and digital media.\n\nShould Investors Buy GOOGL and META Stock?\n\nGrowth forecasts clearly favor tech stocks like GOOGL and META. Their earnings are expected to compound at rates more than double that of traditional value stocks like WMT, PG, and KO. This highlights a key point: while value stocks provide stability, their limited growth potential makes them less attractive for investors seeking high returns over the long term. On top of that, tech stocks now offer better relative valuations following the recent rotation into defensive stocks, making them an even more compelling buy.\n\nFor example, GOOGL and META, despite their higher growth potential, currently trade at forward P/E multiples lower than their historical averages, as investors have become more cautious on tech. Meanwhile, WMT, PG, and KO, with slower growth prospects, are trading at elevated P/E ratios compared to their historical norms, as investors have flocked to these defensive names amid economic uncertainty.\n\nThis unusual dynamic presents a rare opportunity for investors. Buying tech stocks with high growth potential at attractive valuations can offer a combination of both growth and value. On the flip side, while value stocks provide near-term safety, they may be fully priced, with limited upside left if growth fails to materialize.\n\nFor investors, the key takeaway is that tech stocks are offering a better balance of growth potential and reasonable valuations, while value stocks, despite their recent popularity, may be nearing their upside potential.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that the next few weeks until the US election would be “confusing” for many since no one could say anything with conviction about who is going to be in the White House.\n\nLee said that the market is going to trade “well” into the upcoming Fed meeting where he expects “some” rate cuts amid the labor market needing support and positive inflation data. Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\n“ A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it’s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it’s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative,” Lee said.\n\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings.

Is Is Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings? Top AI Stock to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings?\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nCommenting on the latest antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google dominance, Cramer said that the US government allegations would have made sense in the past but with companies like Trade Desk, the case against Google is weak.\n\n“Before Trade Desk, I would have said, meaningful, Now I don’t even know if it’s germane to the issue.”\n\nCramer said that with a lot of competition on different platforms, he is not sure whether Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) qualifies to be a monopolist.\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Google Pixel 9 Pro, Watch 3 Offer Unrevolutionary AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google is serious about hardware. Or so the company has claimed every year in the near-decade it’s been releasing new Pixel devices, products meant to showcase the latest and best that its Android software has to offer. But sales have never lived up to the rhetoric or marketing budget, as the Alphabet Inc. unit has failed to lure consumers away from Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy range.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine'\n\nArtificial intelligence fever gives Google a fresh opportunity. The company has a long head start in AI over anyone else selling smartphones today, Apple included, and it has leaned into those credentials by highlighting its Gemini AI suite on the new Pixel 9 device family.\n\nWhy Now?\n\nGoogle shifted from its usual October release window to August this year. Instead of showing up in the wake of iPhone excitement — scheduled like clockwork for each September — it decided to jump out in front and offer an AI smartphone that’s better and available sooner than the AI-ready iPhone. Or so the thinking goes. At a minimum, it shows greater confidence from a company that has at times seemed ill at ease with the idea of too brazenly competing with its Android partners.\n\nIn April, Google announced a significant change: Rick Osterloh now oversees both the Android operating system and the Pixel hardware development and engineering group. That’s the closest anyone has yet come to replicating Apple’s unified software and hardware development approach. This year’s product rollout is also Apple-like: an all-in-one debut for the new phones, smartwatches and earbuds, underscoring the idea that Google is building a cohesive ecosystem.\n\nWhat Works\n\nThe new Pixels are Google’s most refined smartphones to date. Gleaming metal surrounds the $999 Pixel 9 Pro, which combines an all-screen front with a frosted glass back and makes a feature of its chunky camera bar that contains various lenses and sensors. It’s not an iPhone copycat, but it can be easily confused for the new iPhone 16. The design is understated and unfussy, offering a minimalism that runs across Google’s product range, with the newest Pixel Buds also getting slimmed down and simplified this year.\n\nWhether people buy the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL or 9 Pro Fold, they’ll get the best Android experience available today. That’s the power of developing software, services and hardware — including Google’s AI-ready Tensor chip — in sync. You’ll get perks like extra editing options in Google Photos, trial YouTube Premium and Fitbit Premium subscriptions, and guaranteed software updates for several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe $350 Pixel Watch 3, now also available in a larger 45-millimeter size, has a similar vibe to the phones — it’s a smooth black pebble with a screen that’s easy to read even in the sunniest of conditions. Its look is deliberately polished, far from the chunky and overtly techie appearance of something like Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra. It’s an aesthetically versatile design, appropriate for both a run in the park and a dress-shirt evening gala.\n\nWhere Samsung, Xiaomi Corp. and other Android vendors spend time duplicating Google’s apps and software, Google can focus on implementing more features and integrating them directly into the operating system. Google Lens, which helps identify and search for items on the user’s screen, along with automatic transcriptions and translations, are a couple such examples. The Google Assistant now uses Gemini AI to respond to voice queries, making it easier to have (sort of) a conversation with the Pixel phone or watch.\n\nSince the first Pixel handset debuted in 2016, Google’s cameras have been the best example of how its AI integrations give it a leg up on the competition. With the Pixel 9 family, that remains a strength. Google’s software captures moving subjects, such as people or animals, with a precision that even professional cameras struggle to replicate. It produces excellent nighttime shots and handles all skin colors faithfully. New features like the Add Me function — which stitches together two photos so the photographer can be in the shot as well — make for the most complete and reliable camera system on the market.\n\nThe displays on both the handsets and the Pixel Watch offer superb color accuracy and faultlessly smooth operation. The quality of the hardware and general user experience are difficult to distinguish from Apple’s standard-setting iPhone.\n\nThe Catch(es)\n\nTo avoid disappointment, Pixel buyers should dismiss most of this year’s AI hype as hot air. That Gemini-enhanced Google Assistant is still not very smart. It failed to handle queries such as “show me the baby photos on my phone,” “open Spotify to play Pod Save America,” “can you set up a news alert about Boeing?” or a request to unsubscribe me from a news outlet’s emails. When asked to send an email to a colleague, the Assistant responded that it “can’t send texts with Gmail yet.”\n\nA new app on this year’s phones is the Pixel Studio AI image generator. It’s still in a beta state and Google promises it won’t generate humans in images until it’s properly calibrated. Well, that guardrail was broken several times in Bloomberg’s testing, including the production of a voluptuous Disney-esque character when asked to depict a female lobster. The generator also made several rudimentary mistakes — a “show me three cats” prompt returned two cats — and seems to be far behind industry leaders like Midjourney or OpenAI’s Dall-E.\n\nThe Pixel Watch is an earnest attempt to recreate the smooth interoperability of the iPhone and Apple Watch, but fails on a number of fronts. Among them, the watch’s health-tracking features often require the phone to be in range to update data readouts on the watch face. Plus, many features on the watch eventually lead to an “open on phone” instruction. Downloading music to the watch is also fiddly and unintuitive — and the YouTube Music app had repeated issues with playback stuttering.\n\nThere’s a measure of range anxiety with Google’s latest phones and watches. The Pixel 9 Pro XL’s battery runs down noticeably faster than that of the Pixel 8 Pro. The Pixel Watch 3 doesn’t have the endurance of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra and drains quickly during workouts, even without GPS enabled. Both can comfortably make it through an active day out and about, but they require a recharge too often for comfort.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nIn a year of supposedly AI-first smartphones, Google’s latest Pixels exemplify the rush to market with unready features. The Pixel Studio is underwhelming; the Google Gemini assistant is even more so. Much like with the latest iPhones, whose Apple Intelligence features are coming out in a post-release trickle, Google is offering very little in the way of AI to compel an immediate purchase.\n\nBut while the ambition to draw users in with AI innovation falls flat, Google can still claim to have the most Apple-like ecosystem of products and services, and this year’s lineup is the best it has released yet. Its new set of gadgets have the design, refinement and performance to compete directly against Apple’s best. For anyone not already wedded to the iOS and iMessage ecosystem, the Pixel family offers the nearest Android alternative.\n\nFor Google, which now seems willing to cannibalize the market for its Android partners like Samsung, the bet is clear. If the future of computing is to be driven by the close integration of AI, software and hardware, Google needs to be the one building the future iPhone rival. The Pixel 9 generation is just the beginning of that contest.\n\n--With assistance from Dana Wollman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Previously, the mining company had warned against a possible rise in copper prices as the demand outweighed supply.\n\nAlso Read: BHP Averts Strike At World’s Largest Copper Mine, Stabilizes Chinese Copper Supply\n\nCopper is indispensable for industries pivotal to the zero-emission target, including power cables, electric vehicles, and solar farms. Therefore, a crisis in the metal could hamper the prospects of companies ranging from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to EV companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and more lest Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), fails to supply AI chips to the Big Techs due to the copper crisis.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Patrick Jones projected a four million metric tonnes copper deficit by 2030, courtesy of EVs and renewable energy demand. The analyst also blamed China’s weak demand, which accounts for over 50% of global copper demand.\n\nBHP Group’s copper production rose 9% in fiscal 2024 for the second successive year, reaching 1.9 million tons. The average realized copper prices increased in fiscal 2024.\n\nBHP Group has snapped a 50% stake in Argentina’s Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects, which have the potential to help accomplish a 70% increase in global copper demand by 2050.\n\nBHP Group expects the production to grow by another 4% in fiscal 2025, reaching 1.85 million tons–2.05 million tons.\n\nBHP Group’s stock has been down close to 14% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through the Avantis International Equity ETF (NYSE:AVDTHE) and Dimensional International Core Equity Market ETF (NYSE:DFAI).\n\nPrice Action: BHP stock is up 0.42% at $53.11 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBHP To Unlock South American Copper Riches: Partners With Lundin For Filo Acquisition\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)’s New Case Is ‘More Absurd’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there’s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he’s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it’s worth paying attention to what’s going right.\n\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I’m willing to declare that there’s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I’m not trying to call a bottom, let’s make that crystal clear, but I think it’s worth taking a hard look at what’s actually going right—not just what’s going wrong.\"\n\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it’s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn’t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\n\"Sure, the market’s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren’t even oversold yet—at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there’s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don’t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\n\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve’s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let’s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That’s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won’t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\n\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it’s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"But let’s be realistic: You can’t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there’s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn’t cut rates when business is booming. That’s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday’s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can’t have it both ways.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nLooking ahead, the Department of Justice will soon take Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to court, accusing the company of misusing its dominance in digital advertising to disadvantage competitors. Cramer acknowledged that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had previously faced criticism for paying to be the default search engine on Apple devices, but he finds the current legal challenge less credible.\n\n\"Stocks can’t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. History shows that significant market drops like this tend to offer great buying opportunities. On October 25th, 2023, Google dropped $180 billion, and since then, it’s come back with a 25% gain—not bad, but it’s the only stock on this list that failed to beat the S&P, which jumped 32% in that time.\n\nNext week, Justice goes to court to try to stop Google. The Department claims in its brief that Google abuses its monopoly power to disadvantage website publishers and advertisers who dare to use competing ad tech products in search of higher quality or lower cost matches. According to the brief, Google uses \"its dominion over digital advertising technology to funnel more transactions to its own ad tech products, where it extracts inflated fees to line its own pockets at the expense of the advertisers and publishers it purportedly serves.\n\nNow, Google was recently found to be engaged in anti-competitive behavior when it paid to become the default search engine for Apple. Yeah, they got nailed for that. I get it—they paid to reach a huge audience. Microsoft could have outbid them to make Bing the default search engine, but they didn’t. However, this new case is more absurd. The Justice Department is going after Google in a business where they’re already losing market share in the open market.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is positioned for strong long-term growth thanks to its leading role in digital advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. For Q2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported revenue of $74.6 billion, a 7% increase from the previous year, surpassing market expectations. Google Services, which includes advertising and YouTube, generated $63 billion, while Google Cloud revenue grew by 28% year-over-year to $10 billion.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s net income also rose to $18.4 billion, with earnings per share reaching $1.44, exceeding analysts' forecasts. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s growth is supported by its successful ad sales and efficient cost management. Recent advancements highlight Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s expanding role in AI and cloud computing. In August 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) introduced new AI tools integrated into Google Cloud, targeting industries like healthcare and finance.\n\nThese innovations are expected to boost Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s cloud business and capitalize on the rising adoption of AI technology. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s investments in AI, including its Bard AI platform, position it as a leader in the field. With strong financial results, a growing share in cloud services, and leadership in AI, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) presents a compelling investment opportunity with significant growth potential.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "For investors, dividend-paying stocks offer an immediate return, and those with consistent, rising payouts have performed even better, with less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500. One explanation could be that annual dividend increases compel management to maintain disciplined capital allocation while also signaling strong confidence to investors in the company's future growth.\n\nLet's dive into two dividend-paying stocks, priced at a combined $500, that appear undervalued and either recently began paying dividends or have a strong history of increasing them.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is down approximately 5% over the past month as the tech giant faces increasing calls for regulation in its search and advertising business. Additionally, investors fear Alphabet may be behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race against competitor Microsoft, which owns a significant stake in Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nWhile long-term trepidation may be holding down the stock price, Alphabet's business is generating more revenue and profit than ever before. Through the first half of 2024, the company generated $165.3 billion in net sales and $47.3 billion in net income, representing a year-over-year increase of 14.5% and 41.5%, respectively.\n\nAlphabet's balance sheet shows that as of its most recently reported quarter, the company held $88.9 billion in net cash. The excess cash likely gave management confidence to initiate its first-ever dividend earlier this year. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.53%.\n\nNotably, Alphabet's payout ratio -- the percentage of a company's income paid out as dividends -- is incredibly low at 2.8%, meaning management will have plenty of room to raise its dividend in the future.\n\nManagement also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases, which increase investors' ownership stakes without requiring additional purchases. In the first half of 2024, Alphabet spent $31.4 billion on share buybacks, lowering its outstanding shares by 1.2%. Given that Alphabet's outstanding share count has decreased 10.9% over the past five years, and it announced a new $70 billion share repurchase in April, it looks as if management will continue to prioritize this capital allocation method for its shareholders for the foreseeable future.\n\nReturning to the perceived threat to Alphabet's business, management understands the significance of AI and is pouring cash into the transformative technology. CEO Sundar Pichai underscored Alphabet's investments into AI on the company's most recent earnings call, adding, \"The one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company poured $25.2 billion in capital expenditures for the first half of 2024, most of which it earmarked for its AI development. For comparison, Alphabet spent $13.2 billion capital expenditures in the first half of 2023.\n\nEven if it is considered behind in the AI boom, Alphabet remains a market leader in ads and search and owns valuable properties like YouTube. Based on the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company's earnings over the past 12 months to its stock price, Alphabet appears undervalued. That's because the stock currently trades at roughly 22.3 times earnings, well below its five-year P/E ratio average of 26.8. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\n2. Caterpillar\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE: CAT) stock has been stagnant of late, generating a total return of only 1.5% over the past six months. Still, the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer is a dividend stalwart, paying a quarterly dividend since 1989 and raising it for 31 consecutive years. Today, Caterpillar pays a quarterly dividend of $1.41 per share, representing an annual dividend yield of roughly 1.7%. Additionally, with a payout ratio of 23.7%, investors can reasonably expect management to continue its impressive dividend hike streak in the coming years.\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, Caterpillar repurchases its stock hand over fist. Management lowered its outstanding shares by 2.9% in 2024 and 12.3% over the past five years.\n\nCaterpillar's management regularly states its plans to use \"substantially all\" of its free cash flow from machinery, energy, and transportation (ME&T) on dividends and share repurchases. For 2024, it projected that metric to be within the range of $7.5 billion to $10 billion. While an impressive outlook on the surface, Caterpillar generated $10 billion in ME&T free cash flow in 2023, which is perhaps why some investors are timid about the stock.\n\nYet, there is a reason behind the stagnation: Higher sustained interest rates are weighing on global demand for construction projections. As of its most recently reported quarter, Caterpillar generated $16.7 billion in net sales, and its backlog stood at $28.6 billion, representing a decrease of 4% and 7% year over year, respectively.\n\nThe good news is that interest rates are on track to ease in the coming months, which management believes will help some areas of its business, like building warehouses or other rate-sensitive projects. In the long term, Caterpillar will benefit from U.S. government-related infrastructure projects and demand for new housing in North America. Specifically, Caterpillar continues to receive a windfall from the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law in 2021 and the fact that America has underbuilt an estimated 4.5 million homes since the Great Recession.\n\nSimilar to Alphabet, Caterpillar also trades at a depressed valuation when compared to historical averages. Today, the construction-focused company trades at 15.5 times earnings, below its five-year P/E ratio median of 16.9.

        "content": "Warren Buffett once said it can pay “to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.”\n\nSince the GenAI boom took hold last year, investors have hopped on the bandwagon of the Magnificent Seven—a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—and the group accounted for half the S&P 500’s total gains in 2023, according to a report from Morgan Stanley.\n\nAfter a blistering start to 2024, however, many of these large-cap tech giants have fallen back down to Earth. Could it be time to buy the dip? Here are three members of the Magnificent Seven that Wall Street remains high on.\n\nApple\n\nSpeaking of Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha made plenty of headlines when the Berkshire Hathaway chairman sold half of its immense holding of Apple stock. It’s worth noting, however, that the iPhone maker remains Berkshire’s biggest equity holding overall.\n\nSome believe the stock, which is up 20% year to date, is overvalued. Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research, understands why Monday’s unveiling of the iPhone 16—the first with significant GenAI features—didn't spark a major reaction from investors. Nonetheless, he remains excited about the future of Apple’s wearables as new healthcare features are added, from sleep apnea detection on the Apple Watch to \"clinical grade\" hearing aids with the new AirPods Pro.\n\n“Some of this wearable stuff is kind of being not talked about enough,” Zino said, “maybe because the AI stuff is taking all the limelight.”\n\nThe stock closed at $222.50 Friday, with the Street’s consensus price target sitting just short of $250.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia accounted for roughly 30% of the S&P 500’s total returns during the first half the year and is up almost 150% year to date. Analysts have made clear investors should not expect the chip designer’s shares to continue appreciating at the same pace, but the recent sell-off may have presented an attractive entry point.\n\nNvidia’s breakneck growth will inevitably slow, but demand for its GPUs remains insatiable. The stock popped over 13% this week as CEO Jensen Huang spoke Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs conference about juggling customers' needs, underlining why the company is still, as Zino put it, the “center of the universe” when it comes to AI.\n\nIt should come as a surprise to no one, he said, that the tech giants, as well as smaller customers, hungrily await Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips. That may be one reason the stock, which closed just above $119 on Friday, has a consensus price target topping $153.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet\n\nHowever, the most underweighted mega-cap name, Zino said, is likely Alphabet, with the Google parent’s shares down 5% this month and up only 13.5% year to date, trailing the broader market.\n\nA federal judge recently ruled Google had illegally monopolized the search market, which Bernstein analysts said could unleash future litigation that could cost the company over $100 billion. The Justice Department is even reportedly considering an effort to break up the business.\n\nIn recent notes to inventors, however, Zino said he believes those concerns are already discounted in the stock price. Investors are under-appreciating Google’s AI monetization opportunities, he said, as well as assets like Waymo, Google’s autonomous driving technology.\n\nOn Friday, Uberannounced it will dispatch Waymo’s robotaxis in Austin and Atlanta by early 2025, expanding the footprint of Google’s self-driving cars beyond California and Arizona. Google shares closed above the $158 mark Friday, still below its consensus price target of roughly $204.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Incredible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks I'm Planning to Buy If the September Sell-Off Continues",
        "content": "September is historically a bad month for stocks. The ninth month of the year is the only month when the historic average performance of each of the major stock indexes is a negative number.\n\nBut if you have a long-term investing mindset, the September sell-off could present a great opportunity. Not only do the winter months bring historically strong returns, but any sell-off in stocks gives investors a chance to buy a stake in great companies at a fairer price.\n\nSome of the biggest opportunities in the market right now are artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Many AI stocks have rocketed higher in 2024, but the recent pullback in share prices can give investors another chance to get in on the trend before the next leg up. Three stocks in particular have caught my eye as excellent values amid the current sell-off, and all three should see sustained growth from AI spending.\n\nHere are the three stocks I'm planning to buy if the September sell-off continues. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nMany see the growth of generative AI tools as a major threat to Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) bread and butter, Google Search. The reality, as it stands today, is that AI is a major contributor to Alphabet's growth in multiple ways, and it's well-positioned to remain at the forefront of AI for years to come.\n\nAt its base level, Alphabet is one of three hyperscale cloud platforms that developers can use to train and deploy generative AI software. Google Cloud has seen substantial growth over the last couple of years, surpassing $10 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter. What's more, profitability is booming, as operating income nearly tripled year over year.\n\nBut AI can also be a major contributor to the core Search business. Google rolled out AI Overviews earlier this year, using generative AI to aggregate information from multiple websites and answer search queries. Management says the feature has increased use and satisfaction. Meanwhile, advertisements above and below AI Overviews continue to convert for businesses.\n\nAs one of the leading digital advertisers, Google is also working on ways to incorporate AI into the advertising creation and buying process. Its AI tools help increase the profitability of ad campaigns over revenue-only bidding, and it can help generate thousands of iterations of an ad to optimize images and copy for various target audiences.\n\nAlphabet also owns YouTube, Android, the Google Play app store, and a devices business, and it continues to invest in its Other Bets. Combined, it produces tons of cash to invest in the future of AI while buying back shares and paying a small dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares currently trade at just 19 times forward earnings estimates. Meanwhile, analysts expect average annual earnings growth over 20% for the next five years, making its valuation look extremely attractive.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) is a leading enterprise software company with multiple offerings to help companies get the most from their sales teams and the data they generate. But sales growth has slowed considerably recently, with revenue climbing just 8% last quarter and management's expectations for 8% to 9% growth for the full year.\n\nThat said, management is doing a great job at improving operational efficiency, and it's using excess cash to buy back shares, leading to strong earnings-per-share growth.\n\nBut Salesforce's investments in AI could be a catalyst to reinvigorate the business. Its users have had access to its Einstein Copilot since early 2024. The AI feature makes it easier for sales teams and service teams to use information and data from their organization to improve productivity and close deals and cases faster.\n\nThe next step with AI is Agentforce, which helps a business resolve customer service issues, employer tickets, and sales inquiries by using the organization's existing data within the Salesforce software suite. CEO Marc Benioff pointed to multiple examples where pilot testers were resolving 90% of cases with AI agents, well above the rate of other AI bots.\n\nSalesforce's AI advantage stems from the data it has about a business. And while it faces growing competition, it's unlikely to see much impact on its operations. That's because the switching costs are extremely high. Not only would a business have to migrate sensitive data to a new platform, it would also have to retrain staff, and it risks switching to an inferior product that isn't the industry standard.\n\nSalesforce stock currently trades for just 24 times forward earnings. That's a slight premium to the S&P 500, but the business should see strong earnings-per-share growth as AI sales offer high-margin revenue growth and it buys back more shares.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nWhile there are a lot of chip designers that have seen strong results amid the rush to build bigger and better data centers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, is positioned to see strong results no matter who designs the chips in the next generation of data centers.\n\nTSMC is the world's leading chip fabricator. In fact, it accounts for the majority of spending on printing silicon chips because of its ability to stay one step ahead of the competition in its technical capabilities. If you want a cutting-edge chip, you need to work with TSMC.\n\nIts scale creates a virtuous cycle. As it generates the bulk of the revenue in the industry, it has more money to reinvest in research and development. As a result, it's able to come out with the next generation of technology while its competitors are still working on the last generation. That ensures it keeps the business of big tech companies including Nvidia, Apple, and just about everyone else designing leading-edge chips.\n\nTSMC stands to gain long-term as AI matures and more and more companies compete for its limited resources. The biggest tech companies are all investing in their own AI accelerator chips, creating further demand for its advanced processes.\n\nThe stock looks like a bargain with shares trading at less than 20 times analysts' 2025 earnings expectations. They also expect average earnings growth of over 20% for the next five years, as AI spending powers growing demand and strong margins. That makes the current price extremely attractive, and anything lower an incredible bargain.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Going once, going twice: Google's millisecond ad auctions are the focus of monopoly claim",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — It happens in milliseconds, ideally, as you browse the web. Networks of computers and software analyze who you are, what you are looking at and buy and sell the advertisements you see on web pages.\n\nThe company that most likely determines which ads you get, and how much an advertiser paid to get on your screen, is Google.\n\nIn fact, the Justice Department and a coalition of states say Google's dominance over the technology that controls the sale of billions of Internet display ads every day is so thorough that it constitutes an illegal monopoly that should be broken up.\n\nA trial under way in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will determine if Google's ad tech stack constitutes an illegal monopoly. The first week has included a deep dive into exactly how Google's products work together to conduct behind-the-scenes electronic auctions that place ads in front of consumers in the blink of an eye.\n\nOnline advertising has rapidly evolved. Fifteen or so years ago, if you saw an internet display ad, there was a pretty good chance it featured people dancing over their enthusiasm for low mortgage rates, and those ads were foisted on you whether you were looking at real estate or searching for baseball scores.\n\nNow, the algorithms that match ads to your interests are carefully calibrated, sometimes to an almost creepy extent.\n\nGoogle, for its part, says it has invested billions of dollars to improve the quality of ads that consumers see, and ensure that advertisers can reach the consumers they're seeking.\n\nThe Justice Department contends that what Google has also done over the years is rig the automated auctions of ad sales to favor itself over other would-be players in the industry, and also deprived the publishing industry of hundreds of millions of dollars it would have received if the auctions were truly competitive.\n\nGovernment witnesses have explained the auction process and how it has evolved over the years in detail at the Virginia trial.\n\nIn the government’s depiction, there are three distinct tools that interact to sell an ad and place it in front of a consumer. There’s the ad servers used by publishers to sell space on their websites, particularly the rectangular ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a web page. Ad networks are used by advertisers to buy ad space across an array of relevant websites.\n\nAnd in between is the ad exchange, which matches the website publisher to the would-be advertiser by hosting an instant auction.\n\nPublishers naturally want to receive as high a price as possible for their ad space, but testimony at trial has shown that didn't always happen due to the rules Google imposed.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor years, Google gave its ad exchange, called AdX, the first chance to match a publisher's proposed floor price. For instance, if a publisher wanted to sell a specific ad impression for a minimum of 50 cents, Google's software would give its own ad exchange the first chance to purchase. If Google's ad exchange bid 50 cents, it would win the auction, even if competing ad exchanges down the line were willing to pay more.\n\nGoogle said the system was necessary to ensure ads loaded quickly. If the computers entertained bids from every ad exchange, it would take too long.\n\nPublishers, dissatisfied with this system, found a workaround to conduct the auctions outside of Google's purview, a process that became known as “header bidding.” Internal Google documents introduced at trial described header bidding as an “existential threat” to Google's market share.\n\nGoogle's response relied on its control of all three components of the process. If publishers conducted an auction outside Google's purview but they still used Google's publisher ad server, called DoubleClick For Publishers, that software forced the winning bid back into Google's Ad Exchange. If Google was willing to match the price that publishers had received under the header-bidding auction, Google would win the auction.\n\nProfessor Ramamoorthi Ravi, an expert at Carnegie Mellon University, said rules imposed by Google failed to maximize value for publishers and “seem to have been designed to advantage Google's own products.”\n\nPublishers could stop using Google's ad exchange entirely, but at trial said they were reluctant to do so because then they would also lose access to Google's huge, exclusive cache of advertisers in its Google Ads network, which was only available through Google's ad exchange.\n\nGoogle, for its part, says it hasn't run auctions this way since 2019, and that in the last five years Google's share of the display ad market has begun to erode. It says that tying its buy side, sell side and middleman products together helps them run seamlessly and quickly, and minimizes fraudulent ads or malware risks.\n\nGoogle also says its innovations over the last 15 years fueled the improvements in matching online ads to consumer interests. Google says it was at the forefront of introducing “real-time bidding,” which allowed an advertiser selling shoes, for instance, to be paired up with a consumer whose online profile indicated an interest in purchasing shoes.\n\nThose innovations, according to Google, allowed publishers to sell their available ad space at a premium because the advertiser would know that the ad was going to the eyeballs of someone interested in their product or service.\n\nThe Justice Department says that even though Google no longer runs its auctions in the ways described, it helped Google maintain its monopoly in the ad tech market in the years leading up to 2019, and that its existing monopoly allows Google to keep up to 36 cents on the dollar of every ad purchase it brokers when the transaction runs through all of its various products.\n\nThe Virginia trial comes just a month after a judge in Washington ruling that Google's search engine also constitutes an illegal monopoly. No decision in that case has been made on what, if any, remedies the judge will impose.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. entered into a 2018 deal with Google after concluding internally that it couldn’t successfully compete against the search giant, because of its monopoly over the technology undergirding online display advertising, a former Facebook advertising executive testified as part of a US Justice Department antitrust trial.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine' The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads\n\nBrian Boland, who headed Facebook’s advertising technology between 2009 and 2019, told a Virginia federal court that the social network initially aimed to directly challenge Google in the market for display ads sold on websites. The Facebook Audience Network sought to allow marketers to run ads on the company’s social networks, Facebook and Instagram, as well as buy them on websites and in apps.\n\nBut by 2017, Facebook had concluded that it would struggle to effectively compete against Alphabet Inc.’s Google because of its “monopoly” and the advantages the search giant gives itself within its advertising tools.\n\n“Google sits between us and the impressions we want to buy,” a July 2017 strategy memo about the Facebook Audience Network said. Google’s tools give it “the opportunity to cherry pick the best supply.”\n\n“Knowing there would be a layer between us” and advertisers “was a concern,” Boland told Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide on the Justice Department’s allegations that Google illegally monopolized advertising technology markets. Google’s advertising exchange gave it a so-called “last look” in online auctions, allowing the company to decide after an ad was auctioned off that it wanted to buy it.\n\nBoland likened the technique to Google being able to select the 30 best apples from a crate before anyone else got the chance to buy.\n\n“You’re left with the leftovers,” Boland said.\n\nBoland oversaw six months of negotiations between Facebook — whose corporate name was changed to Meta Platforms in 2021 — and Google for a deal that was eventually signed in 2018. The agreement, internally nicknamed Jedi Blue, gave Facebook preferential treatment when bidding through Google’s exchange for web or mobile app ads within its Facebook Audience Network.\n\nThe pact between Google and Facebook, the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the online advertising market, was approved at the highest levels of both companies, with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Google chief Sundar Pichai personally signing off.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe details of the Facebook-Google deal, officially named the “Network Bidding Agreement,” weren’t revealed in Friday’s court testimony. But documents shown in court said that Google was “looking for Facebook to pay 15% of working media cost in order to remove” the last look advantage.\n\nA group of state attorneys general, who sued Google in 2020 over alleged monopolization of the ad tech market, initially said that the companies’ agreement violated the antitrust law. They alleged that Google offered the deal to Facebook in exchange for the social media company abandoning plans to adopt a new type of technology, known as header bidding, that would have undercut Google’s monopoly.\n\nA judge in New York threw out those allegations, saying “there is nothing inexplicable or suspicious” about what led the companies to enter into the agreement. European antitrust enforcers, who also looked into the deal, closed their investigation into it in March 2022 without taking any action.\n\nWhen the Justice Department sued Google last year for monopolizing the advertising technology market, they didn’t allege the agreement was anticompetitive, instead highlighting that even a tech giant of Meta’s size couldn’t compete.\n\nBoland, who left Facebook in 2020, said he expressed concern internally about the Facebook network’s lack of growth in online display advertising. The project eventually stopped buying display ads on the web, instead shifting its focus entirely to mobile ads.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Vegas Sphere’s First Live Sporting Event Will Be an Expensive One China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ride-hailing leader Uber on Friday announced it will dispatch robotaxis built by driverless technology pioneer Waymo beginning next year in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta in a deal that deepens the bond between once-bitter rivals.\n\nThe alliance expands upon a partnership the two companies forged in Phoenix last year, signaling they were ready to set aside their differences and work together following a bruising legal battle revolving around allegations that Uber had stolen Waymo's trade secrets.\n\nUber's increasing reliance on Waymo's robotaxis to supplement the fleet of cars driven by people responding to requests sent on a mobile app comes just a few weeks after it announced plans to deploy driverless cars from General Motors' beleaguered Cruise subsidiary.\n\nIt hasn't been revealed yet where Uber and Cruise will be working together next year, but it probably won't be in California, where Cruise's license remains suspended f ollowing a grisly October 2023 incident in San Francisco that seriously injured a pedestrian.\n\nUnlike Cruise, Waymo so far hasn't been involved in any major crashes or accidents that have sidelined its robotaxis, which are now giving more than 100,000 rides per week in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix, on its own ride-hailing app.\n\nBut Waymo's robotaxis will be responding to requests on Uber's app in Austin and Atlanta next year, instead of Waymo's own.\n\nWorking through Uber's already well established app in those cities signals that Waymo is looking at ways to introduce its driverless technology in new markets more quickly in an effort to make money to its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., which also owns Google.\n\nAlthough Alphabet doesn’t disclose Waymo’s financial results, the robotaxi service is believed to responsible for most of the $4.6 billion in operating losses posted by its “Other Bets” division during the first half of this year.\n\nThe cozy relationship between Uber and Waymo is a dramatic about-face from the legal bickering that culminated in the two sides agreeing to a $245 million settlement during a high-profile trial in 2018. The truce resolved a lawsuit alleging former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick conspired with former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to steal Waymo’s self-driving car technology.\n\nLevandowski later pled guilty to criminal charges that arose from the civil lawsuit, but avoided an 18-month prison sentence in January 2021 when he was pardoned by President Donald Trump just before he left office.\n\nUber subsequently sold the self-driving car division that triggered the theft allegations under current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, after one of the company's robotic vehicles killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March 2018.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Bear Case Theory",
        "content": "We came across a bearish thesis on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) on Kroker Equity Research’s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GOOGL. Alphabet Inc. share was trading at $154.69 as of Sept 12th. 10 Toughest Google Interview Questions and Answers\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, is a global leader in digital products and platforms. The company operates through three main segments: Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Google Services includes products such as Search, YouTube, Android, and Gmail, which are integral to Alphabet's dominance in the digital world. Google Cloud has also made significant strides, transitioning from an operating loss in 2021 and 2022 to profitability in 2023, largely driven by revenue growth and reduced depreciation expenses from changes in the estimated useful life of servers and network equipment. With this turnaround, the Cloud segment is now expected to contribute significantly to Alphabet’s financial performance in the future, as outlined by management in the Q1 2024 earnings call.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet is exceptionally profitable and debt-free, generating substantial free cash flow while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure, particularly for AI applications. Despite the large capital expenditures, Alphabet's profitability has improved, with its return on invested capital (ROIC) reaching 29% in Q1 2024. The company has also been actively repurchasing shares, with significant buybacks authorized and executed in recent years, although a substantial portion of these repurchases offsets dilution from stock-based compensation.\n\nAlphabet's growth potential is also supported by YouTube, a standout platform that captures nearly 10% of U.S. screen time. YouTube has expanded significantly, with ad revenues reaching $31.5 billion in 2023 and a growing base of over 100 million Music and Premium subscribers. This growth underscores YouTube's critical role in Alphabet’s strategy and its future profitability prospects.\n\nAlphabet's heavy investment in AI is another key aspect of its growth strategy. The company is integrating AI capabilities across its products and services, although it currently lags behind competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft. Nonetheless, Alphabet is confident in the long-term opportunities that AI presents. The company's plans to acquire Wiz, a cybersecurity startup, for $23 billion further indicate its commitment to strengthening its cloud business, enhancing its competitive position against larger rivals like AWS and Microsoft Azure.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Alphabet's financial performance and market leadership suggest a compelling investment case, its valuation remains a point of concern. A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis suggests the stock may be overvalued at its current price of $177 per share, even under optimistic scenarios. Although Alphabet is an exceptional business with strong growth prospects, potential investors must consider the risk of overpaying, even for a company of this caliber.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 216 hedge fund portfolios held GOOGL at the end of the second quarter which was 222 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies Inc. will be the sole app offering driverless rides in Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo cars in Austin and Atlanta, a boost to the rideshare app’s ambitions in the autonomous vehicle arena.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race From Louisville, a Push to Plant Trees for Public Health For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life NYC Transit Capital Upgrades Face $27 Billion Gap, DiNapoli Says\n\nBeginning early next year, Uber will exclusively manage and dispatch a new fleet of Waymo’s all-electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, providing services including vehicle cleaning and repair, the companies said in a joint statement. Waymo will be responsible for testing and operating Waymo Driver and will provide roadside assistance and other rider support. The fleet size “will grow to hundreds over time,” they said.\n\nThe move deepens the two companies’ partnership, one of a string of tie-ups Uber has struck in a bid to position itself as a platform for commercializing autonomous vehicles. It’s a departure from its past ambitious yet costly endeavors to build self-driving car technology in-house.\n\nShares of Uber jumped as much as 6.6% after trading opened in New York. Alphabet shares rose as much as 1.4%.\n\nWaymo and Uber signed a strategic partnership in May last year, promising rides for the public starting in Phoenix. Since then, Uber has announced similar collaborative efforts with General Motors Co.’s Cruise LLC, which is also set to launch early next year, as well as with BYD Co. Last month, it also announced it was making a strategic investment in SoftBank Group Corp.-backed self-driving software firm Wayve Technologies Ltd.\n\nWith autonomous cars yet to win widespread adoption, Uber’s platform offers carmakers “high utilization” of expensive fleets, according to Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi.\n\nUber can shape supply and demand, Khosrowshahi said at a Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference in San Francisco earlier this week. “During peak times you can have a hybrid network that’s partially autonomous, partially manned,” he said. “We bring it to scale, we bring it all over the world and we think it’s a reason why many, many autonomous players are choosing to work with us including the leading players.”\n\n(Updates with Alphabet share move in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCollege Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path US Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned -4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.21 billion and $325.72 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has appointed Carolina Dybeck Happe as its new EVP and COO.\n\nHappe served at GE as SVP and CFO from 2020 until September 2023. Reuters reports that she was pivotal in leading the company’s turnaround and helped complete the spin-off of energy infrastructure unit GE Vernova in April 2024 after she stepped down from her role as CFO.\n\nMicrosoft’s move coincides with its pursuit of the lead in the cloud services market by solidifying its moat against Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Taps Former Nvidia Exec to Lead AI Vision, Bolstering Strategic Growth\n\nThe hiring also followed the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) outage that hampered Microsoft devices, Reuters cites D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nMicrosoft made another critical hiring earlier this year. In March 2024, the company poached the co-founder of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind AI lab co-founder Mustafa Suleyman from Inflection AI to lead Microsoft’s AI division.\n\nMicrosoft gained over 27% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through iShares Global Tech ETF (NYSE:IXN) and Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT).\n\nMicrosoft Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Microsoft, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line.\n\nFor Microsoft, the 200-day moving average sits at $412.21, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $427.0. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: MSFT stock traded lower by 0.19% at $426.21 premarket at the last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMicrosoft’s AI PCs Stumble With Game Compatibility: Report\n\nStory continues\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Loading Up on Stocks Again; Here Are the 6 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "While election season is keeping politicians occupied along with their regular legislative duties, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, hasn't lost focus on adding to her stock portfolio. The representative from the Peach State steadfastly picked up new positions throughout the past few months, demonstrating interest in everything from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to Vanguard funds.\n\nIn the latest go-round, Greene, increased her AI exposure in a variety of ways, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). While Greene didn't disclose the exact amount that she invested in each of the stocks, her regulatory filing reveals that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nMore of the same magnificent (and other) names\n\nReviewing her stock purchases over the past few months, investors will find that Greene clearly has a penchant for artificial intelligence stocks -- in particular, \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. In fact, in her latest round of buying activity, Greene was building larger positions in stocks she had already purchased. Greene scooped up shares of Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia on Sept. 3, having bought the same stocks on Aug. 21. Greene didn't disclose her motivation for the move, but it's possible that she sensed a buying opportunity. Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia fell 5%, 2%, and 16%, respectively, between Aug. 21 and Sept. 3.\n\nWhile there's no clear explanation for the sell-off in Alphabet stock at that time, it may simply be an extension of the market's skepticism regarding Alphabet's future after it lost an important antitrust case over the summer. With regard to Amazon, investors may have been bearish in reaction to Reuters reporting on Aug. 29 that some Amazon workers would join a Teamsters strike against unfair labor practices that had extended into several states. And investors were likely clicking the sell button on Nvidia stock after the company failed to meet the market's sky-high expectations for its second-quarter 2025 financial results.\n\nApple represents another Magnificent Seven stock that found its way to Greene's buy list again. Previously, Greene had bought the tech superstar's stock in May, and it's possible that she chose to increase her position in September after a slight sell-off following news that Warren Buffett pared the BerkshireHathaway position in Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough it's not a Magnificent Seven stock, CrowdStrike is another repeat-buy stock that Greene had bought previously -- this one in in June. Perhaps sensing another bargain, Greene may have seen value in the cybersecurity specialist, whose stock took a nosedive, after it was found to be largely responsible for causing global internet outages in July.\n\nDriving in a new direction\n\nHitching a ride with an electric vehicle (EV) stalwart for the first time, Greene added shares of Tesla to her portfolio -- a stock that provides even more exposure the burgeoning field of AI. In addition to providing Tesla drivers with the option for autonomous driving capability with its AI-powered full self-driving mode, Tesla has committed to developing humanoid robots that are embedded with AI.\n\nDespite its stock falling in late July and into August, Tesla electrified the hopes of some investors in August when they learned that the company's Cybertruck sales were strong in July -- an auspicious sign for a stock that many had maligned after the company reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nWhat's a Main Street investor to do?\n\nSmart as it may be to dig into politicians' stock buys and sales, it's never a wise move to blindly follow their actions. Instead, investors should resolve to use the knowledge of politicians' stock moves as starting points for engaging in further research. Nonetheless, Greene's recent stock picks are all worthwhile considerations at the moment, as all six stocks are industry leaders that provide investors with varying types of exposure to AI.\n\nFor those looking to strengthen their holdings with a leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike is a worthy consideration even after the July incident. Similarly, with bearish sentiment surrounding Alphabet from its lost antitrust case, now may be a good time to pick up shares for those with long-term investing horizons who don't find near-term volatility daunting. And with regard to Amazon, the company continues to report strong financials thanks to its Amazon Web Services business along with its other offerings, even inspiring billionaires to click the buy button.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and Tesla, on the other hand, are three AI powerhouses that continue to dominate their respective fields and are well worth strong consideration from investors with varying types of investing goals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "META vs. GOOGL: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two Magnificent Seven stocks: Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL). A closer look suggests bullish views for both. However, a clear winner does still emerge.\n\nOf course, Meta and Alphabet don’t really operate in the same sectors. However, the fact that both have appeared in multiple stock acronyms over the years (remember FANG and FAAMG?) and are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven makes this comparison worthwhile.\n\nMeta Platforms owns several social media properties, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the company has been attempting to reinvent itself into a metaverse company in recent years, touting the metaverse as “the future of digital connection.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet owns the Google search engine and many other properties. Thus, the company rakes in revenue from app sales via Google Play, purchases on YouTube, cloud services fees, online advertising, licensing, and even hardware like its Chromebooks and the Nest thermostat.\n\nIn terms of share price, Meta Platforms stock has surged 48% year-to-date and is up 72% over the last 12 months, although it is up only 4% for the last three months. In contrast, Alphabet stock is up a mere 8% year-to-date, accounting for nearly all of its 11% one-year return. Alphabet’s lackluster year-to-date and one-year gains can be attributed to the shares’ 14% tumble over the last three months.\n\nDespite such a dramatic difference in their recent share-price performances, the gap between Meta’s and Alphabet’s valuations is not significant. However, the two companies don’t address exactly the same industries. Thus, we compare each company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to their own histories to gauge their valuations over time and determine which is the better Big Tech play.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAt a P/E of 25.9x, Meta Platforms is trading at a small premium to Alphabet. However, the stock is on a steady downtrend on a P/E basis, although it’s trading much closer to its 52-week high than its 52-week low. Nonetheless, the multiple compression grants Meta Platforms a long-term bullish view.\n\nMeta Platforms has certainly had its share of trouble since transitioning into a metaverse company. However, it’s still raking in the revenue on its social media properties, notching $39.1 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 22% year-over-year.\n\nAt the same time, Meta Platforms is developing artificial intelligence technology, aiming to build a nice in generative AI and develop the AI applications that will be used by the masses for years to come. Most importantly, Meta is using AI to guide targeting for its digital advertising and recommendations on its social networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these efforts, estimates suggest that Meta’s AI initiatives may contribute only minimally to its revenue.\n\nHowever, analyst Deepak Mathivanan of Cantor highlighted Meta Platforms as a “top pick” among internet stocks. While he acknowledged the limited revenue impact of AI efforts, he also pointed to the company’s forward valuation. In fact, his estimates suggest a forward P/E of 20x FY25E earnings per share, which he said already embeds AI skepticism and provides room for potential upside for the shares.\n\nThus, I fully agree with this analyst’s assessment, especially due to the current multiple compression we’ve been seeing in Meta’s P/E ratio. The recent peak of about 39x came in July 2023, and the company’s P/E has been on a broader downtrend since then — despite its rising share price.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for META Stock?\n\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $584.82, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies an upside potential of 11.27%.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nAlphabet\n\nAt a P/E of 21.5x, Alphabet has a slight advantage over Meta in terms of valuation. In fact, Alphabet hasn’t been this cheap on a P/E basis since March 2023. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate.\n\nPut simply, Alphabet just looks too cheap to ignore at current levels. In fact, even excluding the cheapness of Alphabet’s P/E, the stock hasn’t been this cheap on a per-share level since March, indicating a buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock is slipping dangerously close to oversold territory with its Relative Strength Index of 32.5. As such, anything below 30 puts the stock in oversold territory and suggests an upside correction could be around the corner.\n\nFinally, Alphabet’s 52-week range of about $120 to $192 is far less dramatic than Meta’s range of $279 to $544, indicating greater stability in Alphabet shares. In a market with significant volatility, investors could certainly do with holding some stable and steadily growing shares in their portfolios.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAlphabet has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $203, the average Alphabet stock price target implies an upside potential of 35.27%.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Bullish on Meta Platforms and Alphabet\n\nUltimately, neither Meta Platforms nor Alphabet will be going anywhere anytime soon. Thus, both look like long-term buy-and-hold positions with a permanent place in a long-term portfolio. However, Alphabet is offering a distinct buy-the-dip opportunity right now because it’s too cheap to ignore. There hasn’t been a better time to buy this stock in months, if not more than a year based on P/E.\n\nIn contrast, Meta’s year-to-date gain makes its shares less attractive in the near term. Nonetheless, even at the current per-share price, investors are unlikely to lose money if they buy and hold for the long term.\n\nHence, both stocks receive bullish ratings, although Alphabet emerges as the clear winner.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google knew publishers would dislike ad tech change that helped it profit",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters) - Google knew publishers would balk when it took measures in 2019 to keep them from diverting ad sales to competitors, prompting it to try to make the change look more palatable, according to internal documents shown at the tech titan's antitrust trial on Thursday.\n\nGoogle's removal of the feature that publishers used to reduce their dependence on Google is a key piece of the case in which the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of states are seeking to show the company unfairly dominated markets for the technology that facilitates online advertising.\n\nThe Justice Department showed emails and documents where Google employees discussed the company losing revenue because publishers were using their ability to set a higher minimum for bids from Google's AdX than for other exchanges.\n\nThe result was that when ads were offered through multiple exchanges, publishers often sold to exchanges other than Google's.\n\nThe company knew publishers were willing to accept making less money on some ad sales in exchange for the ability to preference other ad tech companies, such as those who charged a lower fee, according to the documents.\n\n\"It helps them to keep Google at bay and put pressure on us (similar to any industry),\" Google executives discussed on an email thread in 2017.\n\nAs Google prepared to terminate the feature in 2019, employees discussed how to mitigate potential blowback from publishers.\n\nRolling the change out by itself \"would be viewed as pure loss of functionality that we're doing for our own (perceived 'nefarious/self serving' reasons),\" Nitish Korula, then a research scientist at Google, said in an email.\n\nGoogle ultimately introduced the change alongside other features publishers favored, including the end of a practice whereby Google's ad selling tools would receive a \"last look\" that let it outbid other sellers.\n\nThe changes were meant as improvements to make the system simpler and fairer, and Google estimated its top 500 publishers saw a median increase of 2.7 percent in ad auction revenue, former Google employee Rahul Srinivasan testified.\n\nBut publishing executives, including at the New York Times, News Corp and The Weather Company, revolted against the loss of control, according to recordings of an April 2019 meeting played in court.\n\n\"You have made it next to impossible for any of us to figure out how to increase our yield with partners outside of Google,\" Jana Meron, then an advertising executive at Business Insider, said in one clip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe trial is expected to last multiple weeks. If U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would later consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Alexandria, Virginia; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner David Tepper?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Billionaire David Tepper stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party. David Tepper’s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\n“I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.”\n\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school — 100 shares of a $2 stock, “but then the whole thing went bankrupt,” he said.\n\n“It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.”\n\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper’s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he’d joined in 1985. Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World’s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nTepper’s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it’s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire’s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) the Best AI Stock to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper’s Stake: $353,083,500 Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction. Despite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. Cloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported robust quarterly financials, demonstrating accelerated revenue growth and improved margins from restructuring efforts. The company’s core advertising business is rebounding after a challenging 2022-2023 period, when advertisers curtailed spending due to economic concerns. While this quarter’s exceptional growth rate may not persist, Alphabet’s performance indicates it is likely to exceed our annual projections. Following Meta’s lead, Alphabet is adopting a more stringent approach to expenses. The company continues to reduce headcount and consolidate teams, aiming to counterbalance the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Alphabet’s better-than-expected revenue and earnings underscore both the resilience of its core business and management’s early success in sustainably restructuring the cost base. Notably, AI advancements are already showing promising results, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving advertiser performance. These developments position Alphabet favorably in an increasingly AI-driven digital landscape.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

        "content": "Large Employers Building Affordable Housing For Workers: Wave Of The Future?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIt is widely believed that the U.S. has a housing shortage, although the extent varies by location. Zillow.com says the U.S. has a shortage of 4.5 million homes, which has grown by 6% over the last year.\n\nOrphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow, noted that the lack of affordable private homes pushes up rental prices as demand for renting grows. The basic problem is that more families are created annually than housing units.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nThe Biden Administration has proposed tax incentives for homebuilders to build over two million new homes. In his State of the Union address, Joe Biden also proposed a new tax credit providing $10,000 to first-time homebuyers.\n\nHowever, the fine print indicates the tax credit isn't as significant as it sounds. The credit is only $5,000 per year for two years. For someone in the 22% tax bracket, the savings would only be $1,100 each year. Another problem is the credit given in the year after the home closes. So, the credit does not help prospective buyers with a down payment, closing costs, moving expenses, or commission after the NAR lawsuit.\n\nOne new solution for the housing shortage has emerged from large employers building affordable \"workforce housing\" for their employees. Several large tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are building towns with rental homes to attract employees. Google also offers a housing stipend and relocation bonus to help with relocation and housing expenses. Meta has a similar housing assistance program for some employees.\n\nTesla has built a town called Snailbrook near Austin, TX, with over 100 rental homes. Rents start as low as $800 per month. The town includes a pool, gym, outdoor sports area and a Montessori school for a small number of students.\n\nSome of Florida's largest employers are also getting on board with workforce building. In Tampa, General Hospital has proposed a $60 million apartment complex that will eventually offer below-market rents to its employees. The 160-unit apartment complex has already received $2 million from the county and $10 million from the state. Workers who earn between 80% and 120% of the area's median income (AMI) will qualify to live in the units.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe concept is a win-win for both employers and employees. Workers benefit from having low-cost housing available in areas where rents are normally much higher, and employers benefit by being able to recruit and retain employees who otherwise might decide to move to less expensive cities or states.\n\nRead More:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Private markets have historically outperformed stocks in every downturn of the past 15 years — build your diversified portfolio.\n\nMiami's Jackson Health System and the Miami-Dade County Public Schools are also discussing workforce housing development. The Public Schools are working with Miami-Dade's Public Housing and Community Development Department to build affordable apartments for teachers and other school district employees who earn less than 80% of the median income in that area.\n\nJackson Health System wants to replace an old office building on the Jackson Memorial Medical Center campus with new apartments conveniently located next to the Metrorail. The project would also include a child care center and improve the Metrorail station to encourage the use of mass transit. At least 50% of the units would be reserved for workers who earn between 60% and 120% of the median income for that area.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) is another large Florida employer that has decided to provide its workers with affordable housing. It's developing an 80-acre housing project near its Walt Disney World park in Orlando. Disney wants to build up to 1,400 apartment units, with over 1,000 reserved as affordable units. Most units will be for families in the 80% AMI range or approximately $50,000 to $90,000. The expected completion date is 2026.\n\nHowever, as is often the case, Disney has received pushback from area residents who felt the housing development would increase traffic and affect their quality of life. In a meeting in September 2023, Orange County officials received 104 responses against the project and only 17 in favor of it. Yet, the Orange County commissioners approved the housing project by a 4-2 vote this past March.\n\nWhile that worked out for Disney, affordable housing projects have been rejected in other areas of the state, such as St. Johns County, due to increased concerns about being able to handle traffic.\n\nSo, private industry has succeeded in developing one possible solution to the affordable housing problem. This certainly could be the wave of the future, as these workforce communities help alleviate some of the difficulties that companies face in recruiting and retaining employees while giving workers an affordable yet quality place to live. The most difficult part will be finding locations that don't bring about extra problems for residents of the surrounding communities.\n\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Owning Property\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields and you don't have to own property to do it...\n\nThe Arrived Homes investment platform has created a Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

        "content": "Nvidia AI Chips Headed to Saudi Arabia, US Reassesses Export Ban\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) advanced artificial intelligence chips could soon make way to Saudi Arabia as the U.S. contemplates its advanced semiconductor sanctions on the country it had imposed in 2024.\n\nThe Saudi government is eying Nvidia’s H200 chips, Reuters cites U.S. and Saudi officials at Saudi Arabia’s Global AI Summit (GAIN).\n\nThe U.S. initially imposed advanced semiconductor sanctions on China in 2023, citing national security concerns.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Gains Ground in AI Chip Market, Oracle Exec Confirms Growing Demand: Report\n\nIn 2024, the embargo on Saudi Arabia followed for its alleged proximity to China. Interestingly, Nvidia AI chips continue to enter China via smuggling and other channels.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s engagement in the AI sector has increased, as evidenced by its participation in AI-driven initiatives and partnerships to reduce its reliance on Chinese firms. This has prompted the U.S. to reevaluate its embargo on the country.\n\nNvidia’s quarterly print left the Street unimpressed, which led to a broader industry selloff.\n\nAnalysts, including Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson and Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, maintain Nvidia as the critical AI play as Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), splurge on their AI ambitions.\n\nNvidia Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research can be a valuable source of information for learning about a company's fundamentals.

No analysts have bearish recommendations on NVIDIA, while 42 analysts have bullish ratings. The street high price target from Rosenblatt is $200.0, while the street low from DA Davidson is $90.0.\n\nNvidia stock has risen 161% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that’d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the “iPhone moment” for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the “App Store moment.”\n\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\n\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\n“Annual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.”\n\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Analysts Recommending Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Stock?\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a latest interview with CNBC that he’s bullish on Alphabet following the pullback on antitrust concerns. The analyst does not see Google “breaking up or paying a big fee.”\n\nThill said that Alphabet is trading at around 12x EBITDA which makes the stock a “pretty cheap” story.\n\nThill has a $220 price target on the stock. He thinks the antitrust case could take up to 8 months to resolve.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported robust quarterly financials, demonstrating accelerated revenue growth and improved margins from restructuring efforts. The company’s core advertising business is rebounding after a challenging 2022-2023 period, when advertisers curtailed spending due to economic concerns. While this quarter’s exceptional growth rate may not persist, Alphabet’s performance indicates it is likely to exceed our annual projections.\n\nFollowing Meta’s lead, Alphabet is adopting a more stringent approach to expenses. The company continues to reduce headcount and consolidate teams, aiming to counterbalance the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Alphabet’s better-than-expected revenue and earnings underscore both the resilience of its core business and management’s early success in sustainably restructuring the cost base.\n\nNotably, AI advancements are already showing promising results, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving advertiser performance. These developments position Alphabet favorably in an increasingly AI-driven digital landscape.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Owens & Minor, Inc. OMI has announced a partnership with Google Cloud, owned by the parent holding company, Alphabet GOOGL to enhance the existing capabilities of its cloud-based clinical inventory management system, QSight. The collaboration will combine the company’s expertise in optimizing the healthcare supply chain with Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform, to tackle the modern supply chain management complexities and support the patients more effectively.\n\nThe latest development demonstrates the progress Owens & Minor has been making toward its strategic goals for the Products & Healthcare Services segment.\n\nFollowing the news, shares of OMI edged up 0.2% to $14.42 at Tuesday’s close. By staying at the forefront of technology, including making investments with one of the most renowned innovators in the market, the company consistently delivers value to its customers and improves clinician efficiency. We expect the market sentiment on OMI stock to stay positive around this development.\n\nSignificance of OMI’s New Partnership\n\nThe implications of inefficient inventory management in healthcare can extend beyond the stockroom and into the operating room. This includes the risks of expired products being used in patient care and loss of inventory if products expire before. There is also an increasing pressure to deliver high-quality care while managing costs and optimizing efficiency — with less support from clinical staff.\n\nHowever, traditional clinical inventory management systems often lack the real-time visibility and predictive capabilities to oversee the complex healthcare supply chains, leading to increasing costs and higher workloads for clinical staff. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe partnership between Owens & Minor and Google Cloud aims to focus on enhancing QSight’s ability to help hospitals and health systems optimize how they manage the thousands of medical-grade supplies, high-value surgical implants and human tissue products required for patient care. The company will also lay the foundation for future platform and service innovations with the potential to improve the QSight customer experience.\n\nFavorable Industry Prospects for Owens & Minor\n\nA report by Research and Markets valued the healthcare inventory management software market at $331.5 million in 2021 and forecasts it to see a compound annual rate of 8.9% through 2028.\n\nThe rising complexity of the healthcare supply chain, such as worldwide sourcing, diversified product portfolios, regulatory constraints, and the demand for real-time monitoring, have increased the need for sophisticated inventory management systems. Healthcare organizations are implementing advanced inventory management solutions that provide greater visibility, automation and analytics.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Major Developments Within OMI\n\nIn July 2024, Owens & Minor announced a definitive agreement to acquire Rotech Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a home medical equipment provider based in the United States, for $1.36 billion in cash. The acquisition directly aligns with the company’s broader strategy to expand into the fast-growing home-based care space. In addition, it also bolsters its Patient Direct product offerings through expansion across a complementary portfolio including Respiratory, Sleep Apnea, Diabetes and Wound Care.\n\nOMI Stock Price Performance\n\nIn the past year, Owens & Minor shares have plunged 10.8% against the industry’s 18.4% growth.\n\nOMI Estimate Trend and EPS Surprise History\n\nIn the past 30 days, estimates for Owens & Minor’s 2024 earnings have remained constant at $1.57 per share. The company beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.1%.\n\nOMI’s Zacks Rank and Top MedTech Stocks\n\nOwens & Minor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Boston Scientific BSX and AxoGen AXGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBoston Scientific’s shares have risen 55.9% in the past year. Estimates for the company’s earnings per share have remained constant at $2.40 in 2024 and $2.71 in 2025 in the past 30 days. BSX’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 7.2%. In the last reported quarter, it posted an earnings surprise of 6.9%.\n\nEstimates for AxoGen’s 2024 loss per share have remained constant at 1 cent in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have surged 141.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 15.7%.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\n\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports indicate that the tech giant has partnered with electronics firm Samsung and chipmaker QUALCOMM to develop mixed reality smart glasses that can be linked to the AI power of smartphones. The project builds on an existing partnership between the three companies to develop mixed reality technology, which refers to the combination of augmented and virtual reality. The glasses would offer competition to similar products from Google rivals like Meta and Apple. The glasses aim to be more user-friendly compared to VR headsets made by Meta and Apple.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the top AI picks on Wall Street. Wedbush has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $025. In a recent investor note, the advisory acknowledged near-term headline risk to the shares associated with a pending antitrust trial, but noted that the overall risk to the business was limited based on recent financial disclosures related to adtech products.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The U.S. tech giant has its European headquarters in Dublin.\n\nThe probe will look into the \"development of its foundational AI model\", the DPC added.\n\nThe \"statutory inquiry concerns the question of whether Google has complied with any obligations that it may have had to undertake\" under the EU's strict General Data Protection Regulation, it added.\n\nThis would have been \"prior to engaging in the processing of the personal data\" of EU citizens, a statement read.\n\nThe DPC said it was in relation to the development of Google's foundational AI Model, Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2).\n\nA representative for Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"A data protection impact assessment, where required, is of crucial importance in ensuring that the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals are adequately considered and protected when processing of personal data is likely to result in a high risk,\" the Dublin-based regulator said.\n\n\"This statutory inquiry forms part of the wider efforts of the DPC\" and other EU regulators overseeing \"personal data of EU/EEA data subjects in the development of AI models and systems\".\n\nThe DPC’s inquiry into Google is the latest move by the regulating giant to reign in the powers of giant tech companies in the nascent AI field.\n\nIn June, Meta, which also has its European headquarters in Dublin, agreed to pause training of its Llama AI model using public comments posted by European users of Facebook and Instagram.Later, X, formerly Twitter, agreed to suspend its processing of European users’ data to train its GrokAI model following legal action from the regulator.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "46% of Nvidia's $30 Billion in Q2 Revenue Came From 4 Mystery Customers",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\n\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's AI chips are the hottest product in Silicon Valley\n\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\n\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\n\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\n\nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period.\n\nCustomer concentration is concerning\n\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total.\n\nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\n\nCustomer Proportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue Customer A 14% Customer B 11% Customer C 11% Customer D 10%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\n\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\n\nWho are Nvidia's mystery customers?\n\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI. Meta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. Alphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half. Tesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software.\n\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\n\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\n\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Popular K-pop group NewJeans took to Youtube to demand Hybe Co. reinstate their ousted long-time producer by Sept. 25, escalating an ongoing dispute and stunning an industry controlled by a handful of powerful management firms.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025 UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus\n\nHybe’s shares dived as much as 6.2% — their biggest intraday fall in a month — after the five-member group announced their demands in a surprise Youtube live-stream Wednesday evening. The women accused Hybe of discrimination and called for measures to protect NewJeans, one of the most lucrative and popular K-pop bands that generated 100 billion won ($73 million) of revenue last year, according to a company filing.\n\nHybe didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNewJeans’ ultimatum underscored a deepening revolt against the management company. It comes after Hybe ordered Min Hee-jin to step down as CEO in August and gave her two months to work on the group’s album. In doing so, Hybe defied an earlier court order that barred Hybe from dismissing Min as the head of sister label ADOR, which produces NewJeans, according to a statement from Min’s lawyer.\n\n“If our message has been properly conveyed, we hope chairman Bang and Hybe will make a wise decision to restore ADOR to its original state by the 25th,” NewJeans member Minji said at the end of the video, referring to label chairman Bang Si-Hyuk.\n\nThe power struggle at Hybe has wiped out 27% of Hybe’s market value since the dispute between Min and the company first surfaced in mid-April. Hybe started an internal audit of Min’s activities, accusing her of trying to seize control of ADOR. They took their disagreement to court, where a judge ruled the producer should remain head of the sister label.\n\n“All we want is this legal conflict to be resolved and have our working environment returned back to normal the way it was before,” another member Hanni said.\n\n--With assistance from Shinhye Kang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — European Union regulators said Thursday they're looking into one of Google's artificial intelligence models over concerns about its compliance with the bloc's strict data privacy rules.\n\nIreland's Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into Google's Pathways Language Model 2, also known as PaLM2. It's part of wider efforts, including by other national watchdogs across the 27-nation bloc, to scrutinize how AI systems handle personal data.\n\nGoogle's European headquarters are based in Dublin, so the Irish watchdog acts as the company's lead regulator for the bloc's privacy rulebook, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.\n\nThe commission said its inquiry is examining whether Google has assessed whether PaLM2's data processing would likely result in a “high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals\" in the EU.\n\nLarge language models like PaLM2 are vast troves of data that act as building blocks for artificial intelligence systems. Google uses PaLM2 to power a range of generative AI services including email summarizing. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Irish watchdog said earlier this month that Elon Musk's social media platform X has agreed to permanently stop processing user data for its AI chatbot Grok. The platform did so only after the watchdog took it to court the month before, filing an urgent High Court application to get X to \"suspend, restrict or prohibit\" processing of personal data contained in public posts by its users.\n\nMeta Platforms paused its plans to use content posted by European users to train the latest version of its large language model after apparent pressure from the Irish regulators. The decision \"followed intensive engagement\" between the two, the watchdog said in June.\n\nItaly's data privacy regulator last year temporarily banned ChatGPT because of data privacy breaches and demanded the chatbot's maker OpenAI meet a set of demands to resolve its concerns.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Inside the secretive design studio of Amazon’s robo-taxi company Zoox as it readies for paying customers",
        "content": "The industrial design studio of robo-taxi company Zoox is tucked behind a password-protected door in an office near San Francisco. Inside, a small team of designers at the Amazon-owned startup have been tinkering with clay, carbon fiber, colors, and fabrics—largely in secret.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Nahuel Battaglia, the team’s original designer, is shyly pointing to his decade-old sketches of the futuristic car he hoped to help build. The old drawings, in many ways, resemble the car that Zoox plans to finally debut for paying riders in Las Vegas later this year or early next in a high-stakes race to catch up to Waymo, the robo-taxi arm of Google’s parent company.\n\n“That was one of our key sketches, that brown and grey sketch up here,” Battaglia says, pointing to a drawing from 2015 that shows a vehicle without a driver's seat, steering wheel, and foot pedals. In another big departure, the front seats face backwards so that passengers face each other like at a cafe table, since no one really needs to be watching the road in a driverless car. Zoox staffers inside the company's industrial design studio.\n\nWhile Waymo has charged for rides in its modified Jaguars in San Francisco and now a few other cities for more than two years, Zoox is less well known. That’s partly because of the company’s decision to keep its vehicles secret for the first six years while its designers tinkered with them. Its cars are also far less frequently on the road for training runs. Currently, the vehicles, which have been compared to cute “toasters” for their boxy shape—are limited to a one-mile route between two Zoox offices in Foster City, Calif., and within a five-mile radius of the company's Las Vegas office, driving at up to 45 miles per hour. Zoox wouldn’t specify exactly how many vehicles it has, nor how many are on the road, though a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety probe suggests it has at least 500 conventional cars retrofitted with its LiDAR technology that helps them navigate autonomously.\n\nOn Tuesday, for the first time, Zoox invited a handful of reporters into its design studio to speak with those creating the car and deciding the colors, materials, and finishes that will go into it. Several Zoox staffers were clearly excited to share the rationale behind its green and black color scheme, its sunroof with star-like lights, and the shimmery sound the vehicle makes as the doors open. I caught several Zoox design staffers grinning at their desks as they watched reporters react to the car’s horn, which sounds like a muted train whistle.\n\nOnly recently has the team been able to invite outsiders to see what they’ve been working on. In April, Zoox started letting family and friends ride between its Foster City route. While sitting next to me in the prototype vehicle, Chris Stoffel, Zoox’s director of industrial and creative design, told me his family members became emotional when they took a ride for the first time earlier this year. “They cried,” he told me. “I think that they've seen so much investment and time going into developing a product from the ground up,” he said.\n\nBased on the short ride I took in Foster City, there still seem to be kinks to be worked out. Shortly after car started moving, the seat belt tightened aggressively around me, and the vehicle accelerated a little too quickly for my taste. On the way back, I was seated backwards, which is not a particularly good idea for someone like myself who struggles with motion sickness. But the ride itself went smoothly, with the Zoox staying within the road lanes, performing turns, and parking perfectly when the ride ended.\n\nZoox now employs more than 2,500 people, according to the company, although the team that’s in charge of its industrial design is rather small, with about a dozen to 15 people coming into the studio daily, according to Stoffel. Battaglia, who forgivingly smiled as people repeatedly mispronounced his first name, was the startup’s first industrial designer.\n\nZoox has continued to tweak its vehicle as it prepares for commercial launch. Karoline Huber, a senior designer at Zoox who's focused on the materials that go into the vehicle, showed off the latest clay and wood model of a Zoox split in half that revealed the lighter green fabrics and finishes of the new design.\n\nThe message that Zoox wants to send with its four-seater vehicles is that its robo-taxis are not cars—but should be thought of as a new form of transportation entirely. Perhaps to underscore this point, there are signs in the parking lot designating spots for the Zoox robo-taxis that say. “Robot parking only.”\n\nBut it remains to be seen how the public will respond to the futuristic not-car vehicles once they are on the streets in large numbers—and how they will perform when carrying large numbers of passengers.\n\nAfter all, Waymo has toyed with its own car designs without steering wheels, but has opted to initially deploy cars with driver seats and steering wheels. Meanwhile, GM’s Cruise, which has scaled back its robo-taxi operations after an incident in San Francisco last year in which one of its cars dragged a pedestrian underneath, shelved plans for its so-called Origin after GM CEO Mary Barra said the company “thought it was better to get rid of that risk.”\n\nIn practical terms, Zoox is making a big gamble with its steering wheel-free vehicles. The benefit of a steering wheel is that operations staff can easily come to the rescue of an autonomous vehicle that is stuck on city streets and drive it away. In an on-stage interview at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in July, Zoox CEO Aicha Evans explained that, if a Zoox vehicle gets stuck, it will need to be towed if remote assistance fails to do the job. “That's the worst case scenario,” she said, adding that “those are very rare” instances and that Zoox can, remotely, “give commands to the vehicle to pull over or to take itself to a certain destination.”\n\nEven as Zoox opened the doors to its industrial design studio on Tuesday, the company has retained an element of secrecy to its operation. There were black silk fabric concealing several items in the design studio, including a vehicle prototype. When I asked about them, Stoffel admitted this was because there were reporters around.\n\n“There are other things that may never leave the walls of the studio, so we choose to cover them up,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG): Cracks in Google’s Search Empire?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe reality is finally catching up to the AI hype as investors await to see ROI on huge spending on AI chips and infrastructure. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a “fundamental shift” in the industry.\n\n“I know it’s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.”\n\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a “digestion” period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\n\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\n\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new “all-time record highs.”\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) The Top 10 Trending AI Stock Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nDan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, said the following about GOOG while talking to CNBC:\n\n“I don’t see how they keep 90% + share in search when you’ve got all of this spending on AI going and you’ve got to believe some of those companies take share.”\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks Amid Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "GOOGL Stock’s Price Dip Presents a Buying Opportunity",
        "content": "The Alphabet (GOOGL) drop presents a buying opportunity and has made me bullish on the stock. While antitrust concerns weigh heavily on the stock, investors have forgotten about the company’s long-term potential and growth catalysts. Furthermore, the valuation looks quite attractive, especially when you assess the company’s financial growth rates.\n\nGOOGL’s Revenue and Earnings Continue to Rise\n\nTurning to the company’s recent performance, Alphabet’s rising revenue and earnings prompt me to be bullish on the stock. While the company has been posting good financial numbers for several quarters, investors have forgotten about recent quarters. The antitrust news has stolen investors’ attention, so it’s good to bring our focus back to Q2 2024 numbers.\n\nSpecifically, revenue increased by 14% year-over-year in the quarter, while operating income jumped by 29% year-over-year. Advertising and cloud computing were key components that helped the company deliver impressive results.\n\nFurthermore, artificial intelligence should result in revenue acceleration as more companies use Google Cloud to store their AI applications. The company still owns the two most popular websites—Google and YouTube—and will generate sales growth for many years.\n\nAlphabet’s Valuation Is Attractive\n\nConsidering the stock’s current price levels, the recent dip has prompted my Buy rating since Alphabet’s stock only trades at a 22 P/E ratio. That’s the result of an excessive 20% drop from its July peak. Even the dividend has gotten more attractive, as the stock currently has a 0.53% yield.\n\nLooking at comparable companies, Alphabet trades at a nearly identical valuation as UPS (UPS), which reported declining year-over-year revenue and net income in Q2 2024. The tech giant also trades at a lower valuation than Home Depot (HD), which has also been struggling with sales growth. Alphabet shouldn’t trade at the same valuation as these companies. Its financial growth rates look completely different from UPS and Home Depot.\n\nTherefore, investors will eventually notice the mismatch and bring Alphabet back to a $2 trillion market cap. Until then, investors can accumulate shares at a discount and enjoy an elevated dividend yield. Alphabet’s Q3 2024 earnings can serve as the catalyst. That earnings report is projected to come out at the end of October.\n\nGoogle Cloud Continues to Soar\n\nMeanwhile, while advertising has always been an area of strength, Alphabet’s rising cloud business gives me another reason to be bullish. Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud computing platform, and it should help the company achieve accelerated financial growth for several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a testament to its growth, Google Cloud revenue reached $10.3 billion in the quarter, which is up by 29% year-over-year. That’s a higher growth rate than the company’s 14% year-over-year revenue improvement. Google Cloud revenue represented 12% of total revenue, and it should become a larger piece of the pie over time.\n\nImportantly, Google Cloud isn’t in danger from antitrust hearings. Those concerns center around Google’s advertising network, although antitrust cases aren’t new for the tech giant. Google Cloud should continue to perform well due to artificial intelligence and the difficulty of switching from one cloud platform to another. Google Cloud only has a small percentage of the market relative to AWS and Azure, so it shouldn’t face much scrutiny from regulators.\n\nAlphabet’s Profit Margin Focus Creates Opportunities\n\nTransitioning to profit margins, Alphabet’s renewed focus on margins has created opportunities. Specifically, Alphabet’s profit margins have been expanding nicely in recent quarters, providing another reason to be bullish. For example, Google’s parent company closed the quarter with a 28% net profit margin, marking a 13% year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the company’s net profit margins nearly reached 30% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThis trend is similar to Meta Platforms’ (META) rising profits. Facebook’s parent company committed to a year of efficiency, which resulted in 73% year-over-year net income growth in the second quarter. Both tech giants seem to be looking for opportunities to trim costs and return value to their shareholders. They each offer dividends and conduct regular stock buybacks.\n\nWhile there are differences, Meta Platforms’ profits have soared at a faster pace, Alphabet has delivered respectable earnings growth. Furthermore, Alphabet trades at a lower valuation, which should continue to become more attractive after it reports Q3 2024 earnings.\n\nIs Alphabet Stock a Buy?\n\nConsidering all these factors, GOOGL stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy“, with a projected 36% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $240 per share implies that Alphabet shares can gain an additional 60% from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line on Alphabet Stock\n\nIn conclusion, I remain bullish on Alphabet (GOOGL) due to a combination of factors. Despite the recent drop and ongoing antitrust concerns, the company’s long-term potential and strong growth catalysts are compelling. Alphabet’s rising revenue and earnings, coupled with an attractive valuation, reinforce my confidence in the stock. The company’s continued strength in advertising, rapid growth in Google Cloud, and impressive profit margins further support this positive outlook. Given these considerations, Alphabet’s stock presents a promising investment opportunity, and I believe the current price offers an attractive entry point.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters) - A Google executive told colleagues the goal for the company's then-nascent online advertising business in 2009 was to \"crush\" rival advertising networks, according to evidence prosecutors presented at the tech titan's antitrust trial on Wednesday.\n\nThe statements underscored the U.S. Department of Justice's claim that Google has sought to monopolize markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks, and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges which sit in the middle.\n\nOn the third day of the trial, prosecutors began to introduce evidence of how Google employees thought about the company's products at the time when the government alleges it set out to dominate the ad tech market.\n\n\"We'll be able to crush the other networks and that's our goal,\" David Rosenblatt, Google's former president of display advertising, said of the company's strategy in late 2008 or early 2009, according to notes shown in court.\n\nGoogle denies the allegations, saying it faces fierce competition from rival digital advertising companies.\n\nRosenblatt came to Google in 2008 when it acquired his former ad tech company, DoubleClick, and left the following year. The notes of his talk showed him discussing the advantages of owning technology on both sides and the middle of the market.\n\n\"We're both Goldman and NYSE,\" he said, he said, according to the notes, referring to one of the world's biggest stock exchanges at the time and one of its biggest market makers.\n\n\"Google has created what's comparable to the NYSE or London Stock Exchange; in other words, we'll do to display what Google did to search,\" Rosenblatt said.\n\nBy owning publisher ad servers, the advertiser ad network would have a \"first look\" at available spots for ads, he said according to the notes. He also said it was a \"nightmare\" for publishers to switch platforms.\n\n\"It takes an act of God to do it,\" he said, according to the notes.\n\nRosenblatt, now CEO of online luxury marketplace 1stDibs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBrad Bender, another former DoubleClick executive, who worked at Google until 2022, testified at trial that he forwarded the notes to his team, calling them a \"worthwhile read\" at the time.\n\nGoogle has said it is not the only company to offer an integrated suite of products for advertisers and publishers, and that Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms have similar offerings.\n\nIf U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Alexandria, Virginia; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: 'Everybody is counting on us'",
        "content": "The biggest draw at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference this week?\n\nNvidia (NVDA) cofounder Jensen Huang.\n\nInvestors and journalists lined up more than an hour before the session just to catch a glimpse of one of the world's most sought after CEOs. Huang told the audience though generative AI is still in its early days, it’ll expand beyond data centers.\n\n“Now what’s amazing is, so the first trillion dollars of data centers is going to get accelerated and invented this new type of software called generative AI. Generative AI is not just a tool, it’s a skill,\" Huang told Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"For the first time we’re going to create skills that augment people.”\n\nFollowing Nvidia's brutal selloff last week, Huang's keynote was seen as an opportunity to calm investors nerves.\n\n“The infrastructure players, like ourselves, and all the cloud service providers, put the infrastructure in the cloud so that developers can use these machines to train the models and fine tune the models, guardrail the models,” Huang said. “And the return on that is just fantastic.”\n\nAccording to Huang, for every dollar a cloud service provider spend with Nvidia, it translates to $5 worth of rentals.\n\n“I think the days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,” Huang said. “The idea that every one of our software engineers will essentially have companion digital engineers 24/7 - that’s the future.”\n\nFor example Huang shared that Nvidia has 32,000 employees, who will be supplemented by “hopefully 100x more digital engineers” in the near future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking on stage with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference in San Francisco.\n\nNvidia servers \"look expensive, and it could be a couple of million dollars per rack, but it replaces thousands of nodes,\" Huang said. \"The amazing thing is, the cables of connecting old, general purpose computing systems cost more than replacing all of those and densifying into one rack.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and OpenAI use Nvidia’s GPUs. Despite the tech giant reporting $30 billion in Q2 revenue, its stock fell by more than $200 billion on the same day.\n\nLast week, Nvidia shed another $400 billion in market value following a Bloomberg report that the Department of Justice subpoenaed the company as part of an antitrust investigation. Nvidia denied the report.\n\n“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” the company said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang was not asked about the Bloomberg report on Wednesday. And despite the recent selloff, Nvidia shares are up nearly 150% in the last 12 months.\n\nHuang also said while training AI models is resource intensive, it pays off in the long run.\n\n“One of the takeaways there is AI isn’t just about training the model, of course that’s just the first step,” he said. “It’s about using the model. And so when you use the model you save enormous amounts of time — processing time.”\n\nSolomon ended the conversation asking Huang about his biggest worry. Huang discussed how crucial Nvidia's chips are to its clients.\n\n“We have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us,” Huang said. “Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people. Because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.”\n\nHowever, Huang said it’s amazing to watch the AI his company uses to design the chips. “The part of that that is really intense is just the world on our shoulders,” Huang said. “Less sleep is fine. Three solid hours is all we need.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "content": "Apple and Google were both handed separate defeats Tuesday in their defenses against the European Union's efforts to rein in the dominance of major tech firms.\n\nThe EU's top court, the European Court of Justice, sided with the bloc's executive arm, the European Commission (EC), in a case that requires Apple to pay some $14 billion in back taxes to Ireland. The high court also upheld a $2.7 billion fine against Google for alleged antitrust violations. Apple Inc. signage at the company's Fifth Avenue store in New York City on Wednesday, May 15, 2024.\n\nIn 2016, the EC ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, claiming that the iPhone maker benefited from two Irish tax rulings for over two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden. Both Apple and Ireland appealed the ruling, which was annulled in 2020, but the EC appealed that decision and won the final ruling on Tuesday.\n\nEU REGULATOR WARNS MUSK AGAINST X AMPLIFYING ‘HARMFUL CONTENT’ AHEAD OF TRUMP INTERVIEW\n\nApple said in a statement it was disappointed by the ruling.\n\n\"This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to,\" the statement read, in part. \"We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP The Google logo is seen on the Google house at CES 2024, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas on Jan. 10, 2024.\n\nThe case against Alphabet-owned Google stems back to 2017, when the EC issued a fine against the world's largest search engine for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an allegedly unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.\n\nA lower tribunal had endorsed the EU competition enforcer's decision in 2021, prompting Google to appeal.

        "title": "Oracle Hits Record High: Should You Invest After Q1 Cloud Success?",
        "content": "Oracle ORCL, the tech giant known for its database software and cloud computing services, has reached a new milestone as its stock surged 15% to hit a record high of $160.52 a share following the release of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The surge in share price was primarily driven by impressive growth in the company's cloud division wherein demand for cloud infrastructure continued to outpace supply in the quarter, leaving investors wondering if now is the right time to ride Oracle's success story. (Read More: Oracle Q1 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y).\r\n\r\nOracle announced robust fiscal first-quarter results, with total revenues reaching $13.3 billion, a 7% increase year over year in dollar terms and 8% in constant currency (cc). The company’s cloud services revenues surged 21% and 22% at cc to $5.6 billion, driven by substantial gains in both cloud infrastructure and applications. Of this total, $2.2 billion was generated from computing and storage rentals. The remaining performance obligation, which reflects booked sales, was $99 billion. \r\n\r\nOracle has been one of the top-performing large software stocks so far this year, having climbed 47.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500’s growth of 13.6% and 14.4%, respectively.\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nORCL's Cloud Surge: Partnerships Fuel Growth Ambitions\n\nOracle's aggressive expansion in the cloud computing sector has positioned the company as a formidable player in the global cloud infrastructure market, which was estimated to be worth $602.31 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 21.2% from 2024 to 2030, per Grand View Research Report.\r\n\r\nWith an impressive global network of 162 cloud datacenters either operational or under construction, Oracle is making significant strides in infrastructure development. The company's commitment to innovation is evident in its plans for an 800-megawatt datacenter equipped with extensive NVIDIA GPU clusters for large-scale AI model training, as well as its ambitious design for a gigawatt-scale facility powered by modular nuclear reactors.\r\n\r\nIn a strategic move to enhance its multi-cloud offerings, Oracle recently partnered with Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS), complementing its existing collaborations with Microsoft MSFT Azure and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud. This partnership will introduce Oracle Database@AWS, allowing customers to leverage Oracle's advanced database services on AWS infrastructure. The integration promises improved database and network performance, with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) deployed within AWS datacenters. Set for preview by late 2024 and full availability in 2025, this service will offer seamless management through AWS tools and connectivity with various AWS services.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Oracle has strengthened its partnership with Google Cloud, announcing the general availability of Oracle Database@Google Cloud across multiple regions in the United States and Europe. This collaboration enables customers to run Oracle's premium database services on OCI within Google Cloud datacenters, eliminating cross-cloud data transfer charges and potentially accelerating application migrations.\r\n\r\nOracle's cloud business projections reflect the company's confidence in its strategy, with expected total cloud revenue growth of 23-25% at cc for second-quarter fiscal 2025. The company anticipates its cloud infrastructure services to surpass fiscal 2024 growth by 50% in the coming year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $57.83 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 9.2%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.20 per share, up 0.3% in the past 30 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 11.51%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent surge in Oracle's shares also reflects the growing influence of artificial intelligence on cloud computing demand. According to Canalys, global cloud infrastructure spending increased 19% year over year to $78.2 billion in the second quarter of 2024, with a significant portion directed toward AI-related investments. Oracle has capitalized on this trend, establishing a strong reputation for handling generative AI workloads and attracting notable clients like Reka and Elon Musk's xAI.\r\n\r\nRecently, Oracle announced the general availability of OCI Generative AI (GenAI) Agents with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities and enhanced Oracle AI innovations that help customers turn their data into a competitive advantage by making it easier to apply AI to real-world business operations. \r\n\r\nThe company also launched generative development (GenDev) for enterprises, a groundbreaking AI-centric application development infrastructure. It provides innovative development technologies that enable developers to rapidly generate sophisticated applications. Oracle also introduced AI-powered capabilities for Oracle Fusion Data Intelligence that will help organizations extract maximum value from their data assets and gain a competitive edge in an increasingly analytics-driven business landscape.\r\n\r\nSuch innovative AI capabilities could prove to be a crucial differentiator in the increasingly AI-driven tech landscape, potentially solidifying Oracle's position in the competitive cloud infrastructure and services market.\n\nStiff Competition, Stretched Valuation Remain Overhangs\n\nOracle operates in a highly competitive market, facing intense competition from established tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google as well as newer players like Snowflake and Databricks. \r\n\r\nWhile Oracle has a strong foothold in the database management and ERP software markets, its competitors are making significant inroads in the cloud space. AWS captured a 32% share of the global market during the second quarter of 2024. Microsoft won a 23% share of the market, while Google Cloud captured a 12% share, according to new data from IT market research firm Synergy.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to consider whether the stock's current valuation accurately reflects the company's long-term growth potential and ability to navigate the competitive landscape.\r\n\r\nORCL is trading at a premium with a price/book of 46.5X compared with the Zacks Computer-Software industry’s 9.33X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nORCL’s Price/Book Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nOracle's cloud growth strategy, financial projections and technological advancements make it a compelling case for potential investors. The company's strategic partnerships, focus on AI and expansion into key verticals demonstrate a forward-thinking approach, making the stock worth buying in the near term.\r\n\r\nOracle currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Ireland’s special relationship with Apple and Google has created a multibillion-dollar windfall—and an existential crisis",
        "content": "Ireland’s €13 billion windfall from a European court tussle with Apple looks on the surface like a boost to the country’s already-inflated coffers. But, in reality, it has created a new headache for an economy with more money than sense.\n\nOn Monday, the EU ruled Apple had to pay Ireland €13 billion in unpaid taxes, concluding an eight-year battle for the bloc that received little help from Ireland.\n\nThe money adds to Ireland’s substantial government surplus without leaving it any nearer to figuring out how it could spend those funds and what it means for the country’s deeply entrenched relationship with U.S. tech giants.\n\nHow Ireland got here\n\nIreland attracted many tech companies at the start of the century after the country lowered its corporation tax rate to 12.5%.\n\nAfter being hobbled by the global financial crash and receiving €67.5 billion in loans from the EU, the country doubled down on attractive incentives for tech groups while enacting painful austerity measures on its citizens.\n\nThe investment created an economic windfall for Ireland that wasn’t everything it appeared.\n\nIrish GDP grew by more than 26% in 2016 after Apple restructured to place patents and intellectual property in the country, leading Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman to label the growth figures “Leprechaun Economics.”\n\nThe country’s statistics organization had to create a new measure of economic growth due to the inflated accounts of tech groups in the country, which were paying minimal taxes.\n\nThe Central Statistics Office introduced modified gross national income, which, among other things removes the net factor income of redomiciled public companies, including Apple and Google.\n\nIn 2023, Irish modified GNI (Gross National Income) was just 55% of its €510 billion GDP output.\n\nStill, the country’s government has praised the tech windfall's economic benefits, notably infrastructure improvements in Ireland and high-value job creation.\n\nBut the country’s tech ecosystem is facing a reckoning.\n\nThe EU’s ruling against Apple was a landmark judgment following a battle that whirred from 2016, when Apple’s contributions to the Irish economy came into focus.\n\nIreland spent €10 million of government funds on legal fees defending Apple’s tax situation in country before the EU ruled against the tech giant.\n\nMeanwhile, the country doesn’t quite know what to do with the economic benefits it has gained from its past special relationship with U.S. tech.\n\nBarriers to spending\n\nBefore the EU court ruled against Ireland, the country was already trying to figure out what to do with a mammoth €8.6 billion surplus.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Irish government has plenty of pain points that could do with a multi-billion euro injection. The Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil coalition also have the incentive of an election due next year to woo voters. But the figures are eyewatering even for Ireland’s inflated coffers, as are the timelines for improvement.\n\nAn all-island rail review, which includes neighboring Northern Ireland, says a €37 billion investment was required over 25 years to update the island’s network.\n\nThe country also needs to unleash a major housebuilding project, as four people are born for every new home built in the country, and affordability declines faster than many major economies like the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nThe main Irish opposition party, Sinn Féin has pledged €39 billion to a housing plan if it is elected next year.\n\nDetractors have argued that a spending spree risks overheating an economy still trying to recover from generationally high inflation. Others have argued the funds should be set aside for a rainy day when it is urgently needed, with the nearly €70 billion of state aid in 2010 still fresh in policymakers’ minds.\n\nIreland announced last year the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, a la Norway, which was expected to grow to more than €100 billion by the mid-2030s. Ireland intends to reinvest its vast economic reserves in future pension provisions and long-term infrastructure needs.\n\nDanny McCoy, the CEO of Ibec, Ireland’s main business lobby, warns that future business growth is a risk to Ireland, but he argues that this only increases the urgency to invest now.\n\n“Ibec and our members are extremely optimistic about the resources available to the next government and what can be achieved,” McCoy wrote.\n\n“However, it is conceivable that future governments may not have the same level of resources available as the next one. Therefore, now is the time to address the challenges that have been the Achilles' heel of growth, such as the long and drawn-out nature of infrastructure delivery, poor public services, and housing issues.”\n\nThe Apple issue also weighs on Ireland’s mind. The FT reported that other European countries with an interest in Apple may stake a claim to the tax judgment brought by the EU.\n\nIt may raise questions about Apple’s tax arrangements with other U.S. tech companies, particularly Google.\n\nThe Irish government has vast levels of corporation tax in part to thank for its huge surplus, which has been growing for the last few years. The government argues this is volatile and unlikely to grow at its previous pace. That decline could be expedited by wary multinationals.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe Irish government hasn’t opposed the EU’s ruling, and has pointed out it is only of historical significance as its current tax policies fall in line with the bloc’s requirements.\n\nThe government may grumble behind the scenes at the potential pyrrhic victory of a €13 billion windfall that reminds tech giants that Ireland isn’t the tax haven it was for the last two decades.\n\nHowever, there is also an argument that the longer Ireland puts off much-needed infrastructure developments, the less attractive it becomes as a hub for companies looking for sustainable growth in the country.\n\n“The biggest risk to multinationals now in Ireland, is they leave because our transport infrastructure and housing costs are so abysmal,” Irish economist David McWilliams said on his podcast.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Global tech giants halved their business flight emissions in 2023 compared to 2019, but companies like Apple and Google's parent Alphabet are falling behind, risking a return to pre-pandemic levels, a Brussels-based NGO said in a report.\n\nBusiness travel last year approached pre-pandemic levels but trailed behind leisure trips, as geopolitical conflicts and a slower rebound in key markets hindered full recovery.\n\nEmissions from corporate flights by 26 major tech companies analysed by Travel Smart, a campaign led by Transport & Environment (T&E) dropped by an average of 49% in 2023, it found.\n\nWhile this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.\n\nAlphabet, which has not set a goal to cut emissions, and Apple, which set a broader target, are slowly creeping back toward 2019 levels, T&E said.\n\nThe two were among the worst performers, with reductions in corporate travel emissions of just 23% and 31% in 2023, respectively.\n\n\"How can (Google chief) Sundar Pichai say that Google is progressing to a sustainable future when its travel emissions are going in the wrong direction?\" said Denise Auclair, corporate travel manager at T&E.\n\nMicrosoft, IBM, and SAP, despite significant cuts, are also at risk as they are among the companies that fly the most without having set reduction goals, T&E said.\n\n\"Tech companies have claimed to be climate leaders for a long time and many have substantially reduced their business travel emissions, but if they want to be credible they must set reduction targets,\" Auclair added.\n\nAsked about its performance, Apple said it has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% since 2015 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\n\"We're achieving this by making reductions across our entire carbon footprint — including business travel — and implementing significant cuts to the largest sources of our emissions,\" a spokesperson for Apple told Reuters.\n\nOther companies were not immediately available for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Dagmarah Mackos; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Gen Z moves on from ‘Googling’—TikTok emerges as the new search engine",
        "content": "The verb “Google” refers to the action of looking something up on the eponymous search engine—and it made its pop culture debut in 2002 during the final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Xander, a goofball 21-year-old, mistakes tech geek Willow’s research suggestion (“Have you Googled her yet?”) to slayer Buffy as an innuendo.\n\nSince then, Googling has come a long way from being a punch line in a supernatural teen drama. Google co-founder Larry Page first coined the verb two months before the company’s founding, when he updated friends on the company in an email and signed off with “Have fun and keep googling!” The term was minted in the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2006, and since then, the neologism has become synonymous with using a search engine. But not anymore. Today’s teens are seldom using Google as a verb, according to Bernstein Research, and it’s a sign they’ve fundamentally changed how they interact with the internet.\n\n“Younger audiences are ‘searching’, not ‘Googling’,” Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik and colleagues said in a note published Friday. “And they increasingly head to social media like TikTok for restaurant recommendations, directly to scaled aggregators like Amazon for retail, and Generative AI search like ChatGPT to get their homework done.”\n\nBernstein, using an April 2024 survey by Forbes Advisor and Talker Research of 2,000 Americans, noted that 45% of Gen Z are more likely to use “social searching” on sites like TikTok and Instagram instead of Google. That’s compared to about 35% of millennials, 20% of Gen X, and less than 10% of Boomers. Even as Gen Z grows older, they’ve increasingly relied on social media as their primary search engine.\n\n“Gen Zers have also grown up in a relatively mature Internet,” Shmulik said in the note. “It’s second nature for these users to go direct to the source…This world isn’t big and scary, it’s just home for Gen Z.”\n\nFor the young generation, social media platforms have become a way to look up what to buy, where to eat, and how to spend their time. About 40% of Gen Z said they used social media as a primary search engine for brands, products and services in 2016, and almost 52% said the same in 2023, according to data from GWI Core.\n\nSocial media sites like Instagram and TikTok have responded to Gen Z’s prolific searching for things to buy online with their own e-commerce platforms and tailored ads, making $11 billion in U.S. ad revenue from minors alone in 2023. Even more mouth watering is Gen Z’s spending power, predicted to swell to $12 trillion by 2023, according to NielsonIQ’s “Spend Z” report. Gen Alpha, the iPad kid generation, is hot on their heels, already spending over two hours a week online shopping.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle is sooo last decade\n\nBut while social media sites have begun to capitalize on Gen Z’s proclivity for scrolling and searching, Google has another problem with which to contend.\n\n“Something like almost 40% of young people, when they’re looking for a place for lunch, they don’t go to Google Maps or Search,” Prabhakar Raghavan, a Google senior vice president, said during Fortune’s 2022 Brainstorm Tech conference, referencing internal company data. “They go to TikTok or Instagram.”\n\nGoogle’s search engine woes are compounded by its recent antitrust lawsuit loss in which a federal judge ruled the tech giant monopolized the search market. Google’s parent company Alphabet paid $26 billion to be the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers, effectively preventing competing search engines from succeeding in the market.\n\nAs far as Gen Z is concerned, Google has already made changes, given that young people are attracted to pictures and videos, which contrast heavily with older generations’ search habits of looking up key phrases and clicking a link that best corresponds with those terms.\n\n“The journey begins in different forms than before: visual image forms,” Raghavan said.\n\nGoogle has since invested in technology to address this, including augmented reality glasses with “multi search” features allowing users to use both images and text to search online, and includes a “near me” feature to find products, stores, and services local to users. The company is testing an Ask Photos feature that uses its Gemini AI models to answer questions about information in a user’s photo, like the restaurant at which they ate or last time they visited a particular location.\n\n“We have to conjure up completely new expectations and that takes altogether new…technology underpinnings,” Raghavan said.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.23%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.84%.\n\nShares of the internet search leader have depreciated by 8.37% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.98% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.54%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.83, showcasing a 18.06% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $72.77 billion, indicating a 13.61% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.64 per share and a revenue of $292.3 billion, demonstrating changes of +31.72% and +13.95%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Alphabet. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.22% increase. Alphabet presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 19.48. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 29.46.\n\nWe can also see that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.11. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.1 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the latest trading day at $150.01, indicating a +0.31% change from the previous session's end. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.45% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.23%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.84%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the company had lost 8.79% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.98% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.54% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. On that day, Alphabet Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.83 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18.06%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $72.78 billion, indicating a 13.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.63 per share and a revenue of $292.21 billion, representing changes of +31.55% and +13.92%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.22% higher. Alphabet Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Alphabet Inc. is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 19.59. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.46, so one might conclude that Alphabet Inc. is trading at a discount comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.11. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. GOOG's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.1 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

        "title": "Clash of the titans: Google and US attorneys kick off ad tech trial with clash over defining the market",
        "content": "Are the technologies that power online advertising all part of one giant market, or are there distinct markets within the multibillion-dollar industry?\n\nThe answer is critical to Google's defense in an antitrust case brought by the US Justice Department that went to trial on Monday in a packed Alexandria, Va., courtroom.\n\n\"Market definition, not just in this case, but in most antitrust cases, has potential to be outcome determinative,\" said former DOJ antitrust attorney Dan McCuaig, who is now a partner with Cohen Milstein.\n\nThe highly anticipated trial comes on the heels of Google's defeat in August an antitrust case where a Washington, D.C., judge ruled the tech giant illegally monopolized the market for online search engines.\n\nFor Google (GOOG), the broader the market, the more likely it can overcome federal prosecutors' claims that it illegally monopolized markets for online advertising technology in violation of antitrust laws.\n\n\"The DOJ wants to slice and dice the market,\" Google's lawyer Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison said in her opening statement. Dunn characterized the government's claims as gerrymandered in order to eliminate the existence of substitute online advertising services that could broaden the market.\n\n\"I think it's a clever play by Google,\" McCuaig said. \"I don't think it ultimately carries the day.\"\n\nMcCuaig said Google may have relied too strongly on a Supreme Court case involving American Express, in which the high court ruled that credit card networks were one market with two sides. Google's day in court: The US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, Va. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n'No such thing' as open web display ad tools\n\nAccording to the DOJ, businesses that offer technology to automate sale and purchase of ads on the open web, or \"open web display ads,\" operate in distinct markets. The technologies are responsible for processing more than $24 billion in online ad sales each year.\n\nProsecutors claim that Google illegally monopolized three markets for open web display ads: the publishing ad server market, the ad exchange market, and the advertiser ad network market.\n\nTogether, the technologies make it possible for website owners to organize and offer display ad space on their web and mobile pages. For advertisers, they help evaluate those advertising opportunities. Exchanges then process auctions for the ad, in real time, most of which is automated using algorithms.\n\nThere is \"no such thing\" as a \"tool for open web display ads,\" Google lawyer Dunn told US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide the case.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, Dunn argued, ad tech tools are just part of a larger online advertising market that, in addition to algorithm-driven or \"programatic\" auctions, also includes digital ad deals negotiated human-to-human.\n\nA single, two-sided market\n\nThat larger market, Google said, is a single, two-sided, rapidly changing one in which Google competes with other tech giants, including Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, TikTok, Roku, Disney, and Yahoo Finance's parent company Yahoo.\n\nOn top of that, Google said it also competes with ad tech companies that deal more exclusively in the businesses of supplying ad tech for publishers, advertisers, or exchange platforms.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the government's first four witnesses suggested that separate ad tech markets do, in fact, exist.\n\nJames Avery, founder and CEO of the ad tech company Kevel, testified that his company serves only the publisher side of the industry by building proprietary ad technologies for publishers. One goal of that type of technology, he said, is to make website owners less reliant on third-party ad tech, like Google's publisher server DoubleClick for Publishers.\n\nAvery said his company stopped trying to compete with Google around 2012, once he realized that he couldn't overcome the tech giant's rules that walled off rival publisher servers from accessing Google's real-time inventory on Google's exchange, AdX.\n\nAvery added that his publisher-side technology does not preference exchanges unless a customer chooses to do so.\n\n\"We have no horse in that race,\" Avery said, distinguishing Kevel's market from other parts of the ad tech stack.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnother witness, Joshua Lowcock, president of the advertising data firm Quad (QUAD), testified that open web display ads, or \"programmatic\" display ads, are unique because they can be placed anywhere on the internet.\n\nThose ads are different from ads run on platforms such as Facebook (META), TikTok, or Amazon (AMZN), which run their own auctions on proprietary \"walled garden\" ad tech software.\n\n\"Direct\" transactions, otherwise known as human-to-human transactions, are another market still, Lowcock said, in that they are negotiated between real people.\n\n\"They are not substitutes,\" Lowcock said about the different ad platforms.\n\nLowcock admitted on cross-examination that his firm had suggested that a client replace ad spending on programmatic ads with ads bought through social media platforms, which tend to own their own ad auctions.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhether a consumer would substitute one product for another is integral to how Judge Brinkema will evaluate the DOJ's suggested markets.\n\nIn theory, if a substitute exists, the market should be defined broadly enough to include it.\n\nAndrew Casale, founder and CEO of ad exchange Index Exchange, testified for the government that exchanges are yet another part of the ad tech ecosystem, along with walled garden ad tech software that does not integrate with third-party exchanges.\n\n\"I view these as separate businesses,\" Casale said. \"We only compete in one business.\"\n\nOne antitrust expert who talked with Yahoo Finance doesn't buy what the Feds are selling.\n\nAlden Abbott, a Mercatus Center research fellow and former general counsel for the US Federal Trade Commission, said that despite the DOJ's claims, he views Microsoft, TikTok, Yahoo, and others as Google's online advertising competitors.\n\n\"I don't see how this is an antitrust problem,\" Abbott said. \"Where are the barriers to entry?\"\n\nAbbott and McCuaig said antitrust cases ultimately depend on the welfare of consumers, and the DOJ's case fails if it cannot prove that consumers are harmed by Google.\n\nOne obstacle to proving consumer harm, they said, is that the publisher- and advertiser-side technologies have no independent consumer demand absent their counterparts.\n\n\"Where is a harm to consumer welfare?\" Abbott asked. \"Antitrust, in my mind, is not supposed to design a market,\" Abbott said. \"That's not a role that governments should play.\"\n\nIt's uncertain how long the trial will last. Google's case over the DOJ's search monopoly claims lasted 10 weeks. Google will have a chance to call its own witnesses once the government rests its case.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality Lab’s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\n\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for META\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jul 2020 Desjardins Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "News Corp would have lost $9 billion in 2017 by ditching Google ads, ex-exec testifies",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\nALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters) - News Corp in 2017 estimated losing at least $9 billion in ad revenue that year if it had switched away from Google's massive advertising apparatus, keeping the media conglomerate captive to the Big Tech company, a former News Corp executive testified on Tuesday.\n\n\"I felt like they were holding us hostage,\" Stephanie Layser said the second day of Google's antitrust trial in Virginia.\n\nGoogle frustrated publishers by introducing features that benefited itself more than them, said Layser, who worked in advertising technology at News Corp from 2017 to 2022. However, almost no one in the industry used anything else, because Google's publisher ad server is tied to Google's ad exchange, she said.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several weeks, with the U.S. Department of Justice seeking to show that Google monopolized markets for publisher ad servers, advertiser ad networks and the ad exchanges that connect the two.\n\nNewsCorp documents shown at trial estimated that in 2016, the publisher made $83.3 million from ads sold instantaneously through ad tech tools. More than half of those transactions went through Google's ad exchange, with $18.4 million from Google ads advertisers.\n\nThe publisher estimated that around half of that, or $9 million, was exclusive to Google and would be lost in any shift to another product.\n\nBy the time she left, around 70-80% of News Corp ad transactions flowed through Google's ad exchange, Layser said.\n\nGoogle has said that the case is based on an outdated look at the industry, and that large publishers use an average of six different platforms to sell ads that there are more than 80 such services.\n\nAt trial, prosecutors are seeking to show Google used dominant positions in technology for publishers and advertisers to keep them from using other tools and undercut bids placed through competitors' products.\n\nLayser was the second publisher witness to testify at the trial. Tim Wolfe, an advertising executive at Gannett, testified on Monday that the company has used Google's publisher ad server for around 13 years, and that there are no other realistic options.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle adtech competitors such as Trade Desk, Comcast and PubMatic are on the list of potential witnesses, as are more than two dozen current or former Google employees and executives.\n\nIf U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in Alexandria, Virginia; Editing by Richard Chang)",

Meanwhile Goldman Sachs fell 5.3pc following chief executive David Solomon's comments that the lender's trading revenue will probably slip 10pc in the third quarter.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 0.3pc, the Dow Jones is down 0.8pc and the Nasdaq is down 0.1pc.\n\nStory continues\n\n05:27 PM BST\n\nFTSE 100 hit by oil slump\n\nThe FTSE 100 dropped in value today as it was knocked by a slump in oil prices and a weak session for AstraZeneca.\n\nOil majors Shell and BP both dragged on the index after Brent crude oil prices sank to their lowest level since 2021.\n\nShell dropped by 1.5pc and BP by 2.1pc.\n\nBrent crude fell significantly after Opec opted to cut its forecast for oil demand in 2024 and 2025, while there was also pressure from concerns over tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nA barrel of Brent crude oil was down by 3.9pc to $68.58 (£52.49) as markets were closing in London.\n\nElsewhere, pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca was among the weakest performers on the FTSE 100.\n\nThe drugs giant was a drag after it revealed that one of its lung cancer treatments missed targets in recent trials.\n\nAs a result, shares in the company fell by 2.4pc.\n\nLondon's top index finished 0.8pc lower.\n\n05:17 PM BST\n\nOil prices tumble on growth worries\n\nOil's main international benchmark fell below $70 per barrel for the first time since the end of 2021 amid mounting concerns about slowing global growth.\n\nBrent crude slumped more than three percent to below the $70 per barrel level for the since December 2021, while the main US contract, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), tumbled four percent at one point.\n\nOil analyst Tamas Varga at PVM Oil Associates said the OPEC oil cartel revising its demand estimates lower was one reason for the fall, but not the main one as the changes were minimal.

It sparked speculation that Anglo could spin-off divisions.\n\nDuncan Wanblad, chief executive of Anglo American, said:\n\nAnglo American Platinum is the world’s leading primary producer of platinum group metals and is well positioned to benefit from its remarkable resource endowment and the attractive structural market dynamics for its metals and their role in emissions reduction and clean energy.\n\nThrough this placing we are moving pro-actively to distribute some of our Anglo American Platinum shares into the hands of a wider range of investors ahead of the planned demerger ...\n\nThe proceeds from the Placing will also reduce our net debt as we continue to implement our portfolio transformation to focus on copper, premium iron ore and crop nutrients - and thereby drive sustainably attractive returns.

It came as exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly a year and a half, suggesting manufacturers are rushing out orders ahead of tariffs expected from a growing number of trade partners.\n\nThe headline US CPI is expected to have risen 0.2pc on a month-on-month basis in August, according to a Reuters poll, unchanged from the previous month. But on a year-on-year basis it is forecast to have gained just 2.6pc, down from 2.9pc in July.\n\n03:56 PM BST\n\nAbrdn and Schoders appoint new chiefs amid falling share prices\n\nTwo of Britain’s oldest asset managers, Abrdn and Schroders, have promoted their former finance bosses to chief executive amid periods of turbulence at their respective firms.\n\nJason Windsor, former chief financial officer at Abrdn, has been given the top job permanently. He has worked as interim chief executive since May, when Stephen Bird stepped down.\n\nMr Windsor takes the reins following a round of deep cost-cutting at Abrdn, which was founded 199 years ago in Edinburgh.\n\nIn January, the firm said it would slash 500 jobs after worse-than-expected outflows - when investors withdraw more cash than they put in - in the second half of 2023.\n\nAbrdn’s shares have fallen nearly 16pc since the start of 2024, as the firm has battled to keep investors on side.\n\nMr Windsor said today that he sees “significant headroom” across the business and “potential to generate a step-change in performance”.\n\nSchroders, meanwhile, said its current chief financial officer Richard Oldfield will take the top job on Nov 8, following the retirement of current boss Peter Harrison.

        "content": "Investing.com -- DA Davidson analysts initiated Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 per share price target in a note Tuesday, saying it is facing challenges in its core Search business, and its future growth may depend on other parts of its portfolio.\n\nHowever, the firm sees Alphabet's positioning in these areas as mixed, leading them to expect the stock to continue trading at a discount compared to other mega-cap companies.\n\nThe analysts highlight that Alphabet is at a critical point in its evolution, stating that it \"will either be 'Xeroxed' or emerge as a leader in the most important new categories of Compute.\"\n\nThey draw a parallel between Google's current situation and Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) in the 1980s, which invented much of the technology behind the PC but watched companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) capitalize on it.\n\nDA Davidson expresses concern over Google's slower response to the introduction of AI services, particularly with Microsoft's rapid commercialization of AI over the past 18 months.\n\nWhile they believe Alphabet has shown some encouraging signs, such as the reacceleration of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and its potential to achieve AI product parity, DA Davidson points out that Google has made notable missteps.\n\nOne example is the under-commercialization of Google TPUs, a viable alternative to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, which have missed capturing much of the $3 trillion hardware market.\n\nShorter-term, Google faces the challenge of transitioning from a 90% market share in Search to something less, as AI-enhanced search tools gain prominence. Coupled with the Department of Justice charges that may limit its monopoly, Google's path forward looks uncertain, according to the firm.\n\nDA Davidson concludes that without more aggressive strategies, Google's stock will likely continue to trade at a discount.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle shares to continue to trade at a discount to other mega-caps - DA Davidson\n\nSweden stocks lower at close of trade; OMX Stockholm 30 down 0.62%\n\nSpain stocks lower at close of trade; IBEX 35 down 0.61%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Alphabet, Meta initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nJMP Securities upgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $175 price target. The company reported better than expected fiscal Q1 results, while guidance was better on earnings and in line on revenue, the analyst tells investors in a research note. BofA upgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $80, up from $76. The firm cites a combination of data center exposure, valuation and the forthcoming addition of a new CEO. JPMorgan upgraded Delek US(DK) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $26, up from $23. The company has generated consolidated EBITDA of $45M on a value-neutral basis by reinvesting high multiple proceeds into lower multiple acquisitions and organic projects, the firm tells investors in a research note. Deutsche Bank upgraded Equity Residential (EQR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $83, up from $62. The firm sees the company's coastal exposure as a \"major positive given limited oncoming supply and healthy tenant demand.\" Jefferies upgraded Relay Therapeutics(RLAY) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $16, up from $10.60, after the company reported interim data for RLY-2608. Management's thesis on higher selectivity equaling better safety and tolerability seems to have held up based on the data, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nRedburn Atlantic downgraded Costco (COST) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $890, up from $860. The firm says that while Costco's ongoing comp and market share gains should continue to drive \"decent\" earnings growth, the stock's current risk/reward profile is \"skewing less favorably given the even higher than normal expectations\" priced into a starting point of a 50-times price-to-earnings ratio on fiscal 2025 estimates. Goldman Sachs downgraded Nutrien (NTR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $69, represents 14% upside from current levels. The company's retail segment could be a source of incremental volatility and risk over the next 12 months from potential increases in bad debt expense and loss reserves relating to NTR Financial, the firm tells investors in a research note. Barclays downgraded Methanex (MEOH) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $44, down from $56. The firm believes the OCI ownership will present overhangs on the stock. Lake Street downgraded Limoneira (LMNR) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $25. Limoneira's operations continue to show solid improvement, its asset monetization strategy \"still has room to run,\" and its avocado expansion strategy is increasingly well considered, but the firm believes Limoneira is \"reasonably valued\" at a $450M market cap. BTIG downgraded Bionano Genomics (BNGO) to Neutral from Buy without a price target after the company announced its fourth workforce reduction since early 2023. The downgrade is driven by the ongoing challenging capital markets environment, particularly for small cap companies, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. As the company faces challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity will migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning is mixed, the firm tells investors in a research note. DA Davidson initiated coverage of Meta Platforms(META) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm calls Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its \"combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\" Susquehanna initiated coverage of Dell Technologies(DELL) with a Neutral rating and $120 price target. The firm sees two risk factors that have led to its below-consensus EPS estimates, namely the economics of AI hardware remain uncertain and the strategy for scaling AI services remains unclear. Bernstein initiated coverage of GE Aerospace(GE) with an Outperform rating and $201 price target. As a focused aerospace company, GE is \"set in a commercial aviation market at a uniquely positive time,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of MKS Instruments(MKSI) with an Overweight rating and $140 price target. The firm views MKS as the market leader in wafer fab equipment subsystems and substrate equipment.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "We Like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Returns And Here's How They're Trending",
        "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Alphabet is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.30 = US$102b ÷ (US$415b - US$78b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nTherefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Alphabet. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 30%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 53%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Alphabet can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Alphabet can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL on our platform that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "title": "How does the new iPhone 16 compare to its AI-powered rivals?",
        "content": "The new iPhone 16 will launch later this month loaded with Apple’s new artificial intelligence-powered tools, in a move aimed at taking on rivals Samsung and Google.\n\nBoth firms have already released flagship phones that feature a wide range of AI tools.\n\nBut how does the iPhone 16 compare? Here is a closer look at the best phones from each firm.\n\n– iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nThe top-tier device of Apple’s latest line-up the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display, the largest ever on an iPhone, and is powered by Apple’s latest own-made chip, the A18 Pro.\n\nIts triple rear camera system includes a 48-megapixel fusion camera, a 48-megapixel ultra-wide and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens, while it can now capture video in ultra high quality 4K at 120 frames per second for the first time.\n\nThe most notable physical change on this year’s device is the introduction of the Camera Control button on the side of the phone, which acts as a shortcut to launch the camera and take photos or videos, but also as a touchpad for gestures to change audio and video settings. Among the tools of Apple Intelligence is a set of features designed to help users better edit their writing (Apple/PA)\n\nApple is also promising better battery life.\n\nThe biggest update though is the introduction of Apple Intelligence, what the firm calls its personal intelligence system, which uses generative AI to create language and images, take action across apps and draw from a user’s personal context to simplify everyday tasks.\n\nIt includes new writing tools, which can help adjust notes or emails to make them more concise, professional or friendly, the ability to transcribe and summarise audio, and Apple Intelligence can also prioritise and summarise notifications through its understanding of context and time-sensitivity, Apple says.\n\nVirtual assistant Siri has also been given a big boost by Apple Intelligence, and will now be able to understand references to queries on-screen, and will have better general understanding and more natural responses.\n\nAt the heart of Apple’s selling point for this technology is privacy, with the tech giant noting how much of the compute runs securely on the device, but can also access private, secure servers for larger tasks through a feature Apple calls Private Cloud Compute.\n\nThis tech will start rolling out in a software update in October, but a stand off with the EU means the tools are not yet confirmed yet for those inside the bloc.\n\nIn addition, the new Camera Control button will house something Apple calls Visual Intelligence, which will enable AI-powered, image-based searches on objects, buildings and anything else users capture an image of, and will also be linked to Google Search and ChatGPT to help with further searches or query response.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max, as the top-of-the-line device, starts at £1,199 – although it should be noted that many of the Apple Intelligence features will be available on the rest of iPhone 16 range.\n\n– Google Pixel 9 Pro XL\n\nGoogle’s flagship Pixel device comes with a 6.8-inch screen and also houses a triple-rear camera system, which includes two 48-megapixel sensors and a 50-megapixel main camera.\n\nFor video, it can support up to 8K resolution video, while its AI-powered photo-editing tools include features such as Add Me, which creates full group photos by merging together two images – one taken of the group, then a second with the photographer swapped in.\n\nGoogle’s AI photo editing tools also enable users to get suggestions for better cropping and reframing of images, as well as a Reimagine tool that can change backgrounds and scenery to completely revamp a photo. The Pixel 9 range includes Google’s Gemini AI assistant built into the phone (Google/PA)\n\nOn broader AI, the Pixel 9 range Google’s Gemini AI assistant built in, which can be accessed anywhere on the device and answer queries in text or speech, backed up by the knowledge of Google Search.\n\nThe Pixel Screenshots tool can also pull up screenshots of key information – WiFi passwords, gift ideas or receipts – with a quick prompt, while the Circle to Search tool does a Google search based on anything a user draws a circle around in a photo.\n\nGoogle also promises long battery life in the 9 Pro XL – it can last over 24 hours it says – and it’s running Google’s latest chip, Tensor G4.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at £999.\n\n– Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra\n\nThe first major smartphone to launch with a large suite of AI tools, the S24 Ultra was first announced back in January, but still matches or betters the iPhone 16 in most areas.\n\nIt too has a 6.8-inch display, but also boasts a quadruple rear-camera system comprised of a 200-megapixel main camera, alongside 50, 12, and 10-megapixel sensors for high-quality photo-taking.\n\nIn AI terms, the S24 Ultra also supports Google’s Circle to Search feature, and this sits alongside Samsung’s own suite of AI tools, known as Galaxy AI, at the heart of the phone. The S24 Ultra includes Google’s Circle to Search feature (Samsung/PA)\n\nGalaxy AI includes photo-editing tools such as Sketch to Image, which can turn any sketch into a realistic photo, as well as Portrait Studio, which turns self-portrait photos into artistic portraits.\n\nIn addition, Galaxy AI supports a Live Translate tool, which can translate messages so users can have a back-and-forth even when they don’t speak the same language as the recipient, while the Interpreter app acts as an interpreter in real-time, displaying both sides of the conversation on-screen and translating them.\n\nIt supports writing editing tools to rewrite, rephrase and summarise text as needed by the user.\n\nAs the flagship Galaxy S Series device, the Ultra also comes with Samsung’s S Pen stylus built into the phone for note-taking, sketching and editing quickly.\n\nThe S24 Ultra starts at £1,189, but many of the AI tools are also available on the other models in the range, at a lower price.\n\nIn addition, many of these tools have now been added to the newest generation of Samsung’s foldable phones, the Fold6 and Flip6, which were launched in the summer.",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Google lost its final legal challenge on Tuesday against a European Union penalty for giving its own shopping recommendations an illegal advantage over rivals in search results, ending a long-running antitrust case that came with a whopping fine.\n\nThe European Union’s Court of Justice upheld a lower court’s decision, dismissing the company’s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer.\n\nThe commission's original decision in 2017 accused the Silicon Valley giant of unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry.\n\nGoogle made changes to comply with the commission’s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. The company started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services.\n\nAt the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justice’s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal.\n\nGoogle is also appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties involving its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided.\n\nThose three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence.\n\nGoogle is facing particular pressure over its digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial set to begin Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges the company holds a monopoly in the “ad tech” industry.\n\nBritish competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in “ad tech” while the EU is carrying out its own investigation.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's the 'magical' moment Goldman Sachs sees for tech stocks",
        "content": "To get big tech stocks powering higher again, it will take the convergence of two factors, says Goldman Sachs' veteran tech analyst Kash Rangan.\n\nThe magic formula is a steady dose of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve combined with a burst of innovation that jumpstarts earnings growth in excess of 20%.\n\n\"We have to get the industry back from an 11% growth rate to 20%-30% and to do that, new innovation has to happen,\" Rangan told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Monday.\n\nRangan — a bull on Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) — says the tech sector must deliver on the AI front in areas like upselling customers and monetization.\n\n\"When you compound that innovation with lower rates, magic happens,\" Rangan said.\n\nInvestor attention is squarely on the Fed as it nears its next monetary policy decision on Sept. 18.\n\nThe Fed has widely telegraphed its first rate cut in several years as it looks to stabilize an economy that's beginning to slow.\n\n\"I wouldn't rule out 50 basis points, but 25 basis points strikes me as more likely,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\n\"I think there is a solid rationale for doing [a 50 basis point cut]. And the rationale is that five and three-eighths, five and a quarter to 5.5% is a really high fed funds rate. It's the highest policy rate in the G10. It is despite the fact that the US has actually seen more progress on inflation than most G10 economies,\" Hatzius added.\n\nAs for the other component, that may take a little more time — although signs of fresh innovation inside the AI growth story is beginning to surface.\n\nSalesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me in late August the company is on the cusp of releasing AI powered digital agents that can help businesses automate customer service. Salesforce will charge the usage by conversation, Benioff says.\n\nMeantime, AMD (AMD) chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su took the veil off a series of new AI chips through 2026 in an interview at the conference today.\n\n\"AI is a much larger cycle than I would have expected five years ago,\" Su said.\n\nTo be sure, tech stocks could use a little magic right now.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has shed about 5% in September as investors take profits in hot AI trades amid fears of slowing economic growth. Investors have also been concerned about an AI spending slowdown, triggered in part by mixed second quarter earnings from chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia is off by a whopping 11% month to date, with AMD down 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The recent performance [of Nvidia's stock] hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance at the conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons (AMZN), the Googles (GOOGL), the Microsofts (MSFT) of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. jumped in extended trading after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit, signaling that artificial intelligence demand continues to help its cloud computing business boost earnings.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Chicago Halts Hiring as Deficit Tops $1 Billion Through 2025\n\nEarnings, excluding some items, were $1.39 a share, Oracle said Monday in a statement. Revenue increased 7% to $13.3 billion in the period ended Aug. 31. Analysts, on average, estimated profit of $1.33 a share on sales of $13.3 billion.\n\n“As cloud services became Oracle’s largest business, both our operating income and earnings per share growth accelerated,” Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said in the statement.\n\nThe Austin-based company, known for its database software, is focused on expanding the cloud infrastructure business to compete with Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Oracle’s cloud has developed a reputation for success with generative artificial intelligence workloads — the company touted customers including including Reka and Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nThe company also announced a new agreement Monday to make its namesake database available on the Amazon Web Services cloud. Similar deals had been inked with Microsoft and Google previously, and are seen by analysts as a way to modernize Oracle’s database business.\n\nThe deal with AWS is “a good thing for Oracle’s database business, which is still largely on-premise at this point,” Anurag Rana, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nFiscal first-quarter cloud revenue increased 21% to $5.6 billion, meeting estimates. Of that, $2.2 billion came from renting computing and storage. Remaining performance obligation — a measure of booked sales — was $99 billion, which Catz said will spur increased revenue growth throughout the fiscal year.\n\nInvestors are likely taking the high remaining performance obligation as a sign of more-sustained growth for Oracle, said Alex Zukin, an analyst at Wolfe Research, in an interview on CNBC.\n\nThe shares gained about 9% in late trading after closing at $139.89 in New York. Oracle has been one the best-performing large software stocks this year, rising 33% through the close.\n\nManagement has said it’s rapidly constructing new data centers to keep up with the demand for servers to power AI. Capital expenditures, which are watched as a metric of that investment, were $2.3 billion in the quarter. Analysts estimated $3.04 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Oracle has 162 cloud data centers in operation and under construction around the world,” Chairman Larry Ellison said in the statement.\n\n(Updates with analysts’ comments beginning in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Learning to Manage People by Talking to a Bot\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia stock sell-off is overdone, Goldman Sachs analyst says",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs isn't scared off by the latest Nvidia (NVDA) sell-off.\n\nNvidia shed roughly $400 billion in market value last week after the stock fell nearly 10% on Tuesday. The tech stock was one of the biggest drivers of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) worst start to September since 1953, according to Bespoke Investment Group, though it recovered some of its losses on Monday.\n\nDespite the selling, Toshiya Hari, a lead analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintained a Buy rating on the chip giant. When asked if the sell-off in Nvidia stock was overdone, Hari said, \"Yes, we do.\"\n\n\"The recent performance hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Hari told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons, the Googles, the Microsofts of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nNvidia's sell-off began when the company's better-than-expected earnings print on Aug. 28 just wasn't good enough for Wall Street. While Nvidia’s revenue beat Wall Street expectations by 4.1%, that was the smallest margin for the company since its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe big debate around Nvidia is whether its earnings momentum is sustainable. Hari said that investors are questioning whether that will be the case not only for 2025 but for 2026 too.\n\nInvestor sentiment on artificial intelligence has \"swung nearly 180 [degrees]\" since early 2023, Goldman's equity research team wrote in a recent note. Investors' patience is wearing thin, and they want to be shown — not told about — AI-driven revenue streams and profit margin improvements.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nStill, the Goldman team wrote, with a profound generational technology shift such as AI, \"it would be futile to pass judgment based on near-term cost and return economics.\"\n\nThe focus is on the long game: Goldman estimates that generative AI will begin materially contributing to sector growth by the second half of 2025.\n\n\"I think their competitive position continues to be really strong,\" Hari said of Nvidia. \"We do think within merchant silicon, Nvidia is the go-to, and even versus custom silicon, they've got the edge in terms of the pace of innovation.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the conference on Wednesday morning.

Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500’s 40%+ gain.\n\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies’ stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\n\n3Q 2024 Earnings Season – A Preview\n\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\n\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks.  Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\n\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\n\nAmidst Worries, Investors Should Stick to Big Company Stocks\n\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\n\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\n\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\n\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the big and well-established companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company and the internet media giant, Google, is its wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nThe company enjoys durable competitive advantages associated with intangible assets and its network effect. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s technological expertise associated with algorithms and AI, together with access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers should act as tailwinds. Next, its search engine is well-regarded and appreciated across the industry players. YouTube is expected to benefit from robust reach and usage frequency. Its video-only content format continues to be appealing to brand advertisers, which should support Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) over the next decade.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that the market underappreciates Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s exposure to AI, given the fact that its Gemini model continues to be integrated into search results, YouTube advertising, and its cloud offerings. As we all know, cloud players are expected to be the AI winners over the long-term, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-positioned to take advantage.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its 2Q 2024 results, with the performance supported by ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud. The company’s longstanding infrastructure leadership, coupled with in-house research teams, should help the tech giant to pursue opportunities ahead.\n\nAnalysts at TD Cowen initiated coverage on the shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), increasing its price target from $200.00 to $220.00. They gave a “Buy” rating on 10th July.\n\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of the best big company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer On Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): ‘I Have Been Frustrated With Alphabet Stock But Gave Reasons Thursday To Stay The Course, For Now’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Hottest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer’s other hot stock picks.\n\nIn a recent post of Jim Cramer’s Morning Thoughts, he highlighted the impact of recent economic data on market sentiment. The S&P 500 is poised to fall for the fourth day in a row, following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. The report revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs last month, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000.\n\n“The S&P 500 is tracking for a fourth straight day of declines after the highly anticipated August jobs report came up short. Bond yields also moved lower on the report. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% as expected.” Cramer said.\n\nDespite this shortfall, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%, aligning with predictions. Additionally, the job gains for June and July were revised downwards. As a result, traders are now split between anticipating a standard 25 basis point interest rate cut and a more substantial 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting on September 18.\n\n“Job gains in the June and July reports were also revised down Friday. Traders were split roughly evenly between a traditional 25 basis point interest rate cut and a larger 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Sept. 18.”\n\n“We Got What We Wanted, But the Market Crashed”\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how September 6 turned out to be a disappointing trading day. Despite hopes from bullish investors for a weak non-farm payrolls report that would encourage the Federal Reserve to cut rates, the actual report met these expectations.\n\n“What an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we’d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that’s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.” Said Cramer.\n\nJim Cramer pointed out that September is historically a weak month for the market due to significant profit-taking. Although it might seem circular to link September’s weakness to profit-taking, it’s more reasonable than attributing it solely to fears of a severe economic slowdown. Cramer emphasized that, despite the market’s dips, big tech companies, especially those involved in key trends like data centers and accelerated computing—should be considered as buying opportunities during these times.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This market has a September problem. Come September, we’re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it’s the weakest month of the year. I know that’s somewhat circular reasoning—we sell because we’ve always sold—but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you’re worried about a more severe slowdown.\n\nWhy? Well, because big tech is all about powerful secular themes that can keep going even during a recession—and we’re not getting one. I’m talking about the data center, accelerated computing—they’re not going anywhere. Nevertheless, when anything jars the big tech themes of the moment, the market’s reaction is swift, harsh, and horrible.”\n\nJim Cramer Urges Investors: “Do Not Abandon Ship”\n\nJim Cramer discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will offer new insights into inflation. He noted that if inflation stays steady or falls, the Federal Reserve will have more room to cut interest rates, which could help prevent a recession and address concerns from many sellers. Cramer encouraged investors to remain confident and avoid abandoning their positions due to these uncertainties.\n\n“Wednesday, we get another read on inflation—this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession—the thing so many sellers are worried about. That’s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Jim Cramer’s Hottest Stock Pick?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nIt appears that the Justice Department may be aiming to break up Google, as the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)-owned company is set to face another antitrust trial starting Monday. After losing its search trial, Google now faces allegations regarding its advertising practices. Jim Cramer expressed frustration with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s stock performance but shared reasons on Thursday for staying invested in the company, at least for now.\n\n“Does the Justice Department want to break up Google? It sure seems like it as the Alphabet -owned company gets ready to face another antitrust trial that starts Monday. Google lost its search trial. This second trial involves allegations around its advertising model. I have been frustrated with Alphabet stock but gave reasons Thursday to stay the course, for now.\n\nA bullish outlook for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is supported by its leadership in AI, Google Cloud, and search advertising, along with strong earnings growth and potential for increased valuation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s advancements in AI, especially through its Gemini AI platform, have strengthened its position in generative AI. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s plans to monetize AI through subscription services are expected to boost revenue and enhance valuation over time.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s financial performance was impressive in the second quarter of 2024, with $84.74 billion in revenue and $23.62 billion in net income, largely driven by Google Cloud and its strong search advertising business. Analysts predict a significant rise in earnings per share, estimating around $7.50 for 2024. Currently, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is trading below its tech peers, suggesting a potential increase in valuation if earnings growth continues and AI integration succeeds.\n\nAnalysts have set high price targets, indicating substantial stock price appreciation. Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s strategic position and robust financial results provide a solid foundation for positive expectations and future growth.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023).\n\nWith regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity.\n\nAlphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer’s hottest stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Google’s Ad Empire Under Fire as US Antitrust Trial Begins",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google headed back to court Monday to face US Justice Department allegations that it manipulates the $677 billion display advertising market in violation of antitrust laws, just one month after losing a landmark ruling that it illegally dominates online search.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus Rome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain\n\nThe US and a coalition of eight states accused Google of building up a “trifecta of monopolies” to lock up the technology behind website ads and harm publishers and advertisers — claims Google had denied.\n\n“Google is not here because they are big,” the Justice Department’s trial attorney Julia Tarver Wood said in opening statements. “They are here because they used that size to crush the competition.”\n\nWood said during the start of the trial that Google adopted a “classic monopolist playbook” by buying up potential competitors, locking in its customers and then changing the rules to benefit itself. “Google acquired its way to success,” beginning with its 2008 purchase of DoubleClick, she said. The company has also refused “to allow customers the freedom of choice.”\n\nThe trial, which is taking place in Alexandria, Virginia, marks the first case brought by the Biden administration against Big Tech to have its day in court. The Justice Department’s earlier lawsuit accusing Google of illegally monopolizing internet search is the biggest antitrust case in tech since a ruling against Microsoft Corp. more than two decades ago. It was filed in October 2020 under former President Donald Trump.\n\nGoogle’s attorney asserted that the government’s case is based on an outdated understanding of digital ad markets and that its tools work seamlessly with competing products.\n\n“Today we are one big company among many others,” Google attorney Karen Dunn said, adding that the firm is “intensely competing” with dozens of others including Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc. among others.\n\nDunn pushed back on the Justice Department’s contentions that Google controls what they’ve termed “open web display advertising,” saying that advertisers don’t limit themselves in that way. Instead, advertisers buy across a variety of channels including social media, video and within apps — all of which, the US claims are separate from the market in the case.\n\n“There is no such thing as open web display advertising,” Dunn said, accusing the government of trying to open a “time capsule” that would reveal “a BlackBerry, iPod and Blockbuster video card.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle holds the top spot in the global digital ad market, which has grown to $677 billion, according to 2024 projections by research firm EMarketer. Of Alphabet’s nearly $260 billion in revenue in 2023, about $31.3 billion came from the display advertising at issue in the case, according to the company’s most recent annual earnings report.\n\nJustice Department antitrust lawyers say that Google, using its position as a middleman that controls the market from end-to-end, drives up the price of ads while paying less to the websites that show them. Because of its dominance across the technology, Google has the ability to force publishers and advertisers to use its suite of products, generating monopoly profits: Google keeps about $36 out of every $100 in advertising spent through its tools, according to the US lawsuit, which was filed last year.\n\nWebsites show more than 13 billion display ads every day, bringing in roughly $12 billion in revenue annually, according to the Justice Department.\n\nGoogle plans to argue that as the internet has evolved, so has the advertising technology that supports it. Google says it now faces competition from major players across social media, apps and streaming TV services, including Meta Platforms Inc., ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, Amazon and Netflix Inc.\n\nThe tech giant also argues that end-to-end integration in its web advertising tools makes the technology more efficient, secure and reliable. Marketers and publishers choose its products because they are superior, not because they don’t have other options, Google says.\n\nIn laying out its case, the government plans to show how Google amassed power in digital advertising starting more than a decade ago, buying up early ad networks like DoubleClick. That deal, the agency alleged in its complaint, “was a first step in Google’s march to monopoly.”\n\nBefore its DoubleClick purchase, Google used its burgeoning ad business to place ads next to results on its own search engine. But, according to the DOJ’s lawsuit, it struggled to launch a technology known as an ad server, which would allow it to place ads on other websites. The company also hadn’t yet built up relationships with top advertisers.\n\nThe DoubleClick deal helped in both areas. The startup made the leading ad server, and had multiple connections to top publishers and blue-chip advertisers. The Justice Department claims that Google now controls 91% of the market for publishers to offer space to sell ads, and can unfairly raise ad prices on a whim. To argue its case, the agency plans to call Neal Mohan, now the CEO of Google-owned video site YouTube and previously a vice president at DoubleClick, to testify.\n\nGoogle notes that the federal government cleared the DoubleClick deal, as well as other acquisitions like its 2011 purchase of the ad optimization platform AdMeld, when they happened.\n\nGoogle’s actions have harmed publishers, the DOJ argues, some of which had to move away from advertising to subscription business models, while others had to shut down. Testimony from current and former executives from News Corp., The Daily Mail and Gannett Co. may be featured at the trial.\n\nGoogle said it plans to call on small publishers and businesses as witnesses. A breakup of its advertising technology business “would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow,” the company said in a statement when the Justice Department’s suit was first filed.\n\nFederal prosecutors may also tap top Google leaders who have held key roles in its advertising businesses to testify. Its witness list includes Google AI executive Sissie Hsiao, who was previously a director of the company’s display, video and app advertising businesses, and Jerry Dischler, now a Google Cloud executive, who once oversaw Google’s advertising products and was also called to testify in the DOJ’s search antitrust trial.\n\n(Updates with additional details beginning in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPutting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following ‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google is back in court to face antitrust claims.\n\nOn the heels of a judge's ruling last month that its search engine amounts to an illegal monopoly, a new lawsuit opening Monday in Virginia alleges that the tech behemoth's dominance of online advertising goes too far.\n\nFiled by the U.S. Department of Justice and a group of states, the lawsuit accuses the Mountain View, Calif.-based company of keeping a tight hold on technology that gives it an illegal level of control over both the selling and buying of online advertisements.\n\nDominance over the software that runs both sides of the transactions enables Google to keep as much as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and advertisers, the government contends in court papers.\n\nGoogle has denied the claims, saying the case is built on an outdated understanding of how internet advertising works as advertisers have shifted their focus to social media and streaming companies in the effort to reach audiences.\n\nThe trial, which will be decided by a judge instead of a jury, comes on the heels of the case over Google's search engine. In that one, a judge in the District of Columbia found the company had cornered internet searches in part by making tens of billions of dollars in payments each year to companies like Apple to lock in Google as the default search engine on iPhones and other devices.\n\nThis is a developing story.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Oracle Cloud Growth Could Cement Wall Street’s Next AI Favorite",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cloud computing has been one of the first industries to get a demonstrable boost from artificial intelligence. Oracle Corp.’s quarterly results on Monday are likely to extend that trend.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis World's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation UC Berkeley Gives Transfer Students a Purpose-Built Home on Campus Rome May Start Charging Entry to the Trevi Fountain\n\nAlthough Oracle is not the largest cloud provider, AI demand fueled sharp growth in its cloud infrastructure business in recent quarters. Its efforts to expand capacity and etch partnerships with other major tech companies stand to funnel even more business its way.\n\nBut because the company is essentially a runner-up among cloud providers — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. are larger and more established — investors have not valued Oracle’s stock as richly as its peers. Its fiscal first-quarter report after the market close may help change that, analysts said.\n\n“People aren’t yet fully confident that Oracle will be a sustained AI winner, but there’s a wave of investors who will become convinced if it puts up another good quarter,” said Jordan Klein, a tech-sector specialist at Mizuho Securities. “If it keeps showing cloud strength, that will translate to better overall growth, and from there a higher multiple.”\n\nOracle shares rose as much as 0.9% in early trading on Monday.\n\nAlthough Oracle’s stock is up about 35% this year — dramatically outperforming other software companies, as well as the overall market — it trades at less than 22 times estimated earnings. That’s well below Microsoft, which trades near 30 times, and lower than the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of around 24.\n\nOptimism has been brewing among Wall Street analysts, who see potential in Oracle’s underdog status. It may not be the biggest, but that means it has a lot of room to grow.\n\nIn June, company executives outlined ways they’ve been setting up the cloud business for AI expansion, having signed 30 sales contracts worth more than $12.5 billion with companies including OpenAI, whose ChatGPT trains in Oracle’s cloud. The company also partnered with Microsoft Corp. and Google to interconnect with their clouds, which can drum up more business from customers that use multiple platforms.\n\nAnalysts expect Oracle to deliver overall revenue growth of 6.5% this quarter, but for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), they expect that figure to be 46%, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates. The company itself predicted that each quarter’s revenue growth will outpace the prior quarter throughout this fiscal year, with OCI’s top line expanding more than 50%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuggenheim recently called Oracle its Best Idea, saying it sees signs of “continued momentum” even during what is usually a slow season. Piper Sandler grouped Oracle as one of the “big four” in cloud computing, along with Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Of the four, Oracle “could sustain the highest growth rate,” the firm wrote, adding that OCI has potential to grow by a factor of 10 by 2032.\n\nThis earnings season has been mixed for tech, especially as investors question companies’ spending on AI initiatives. However, cloud has been an area where AI has contributed to growth.\n\nAmazon’s cloud business was a bright spot of its results, while Alphabet’s report showed strong demand for cloud-computing services. Revenue from Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure, rose 29% in its latest quarter. That was a slight deceleration from the previous period, but about 8 percentage points of the increase came from AI.\n\nWhile many analysts are optimistic about Oracle, it doesn’t have the kind of near-unanimous backing that other megacap tech stocks do. Fewer than 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying its shares, compared with more than 95% for both Amazon and Microsoft. And the average price target on the stock is just 6% above its current level, suggesting there may be limited room to run.\n\nStill, bulls see these data points as evidence that Oracle is simply underappreciated.\n\nOracle “is seeing unbridled demand and it has a pretty long runway for growth,” said Ted Mortonson, a technology desk sector strategist at Baird. “It has really flown under the radar compared with others, and there are a lot of investors who don’t own a share. Given its strengths, you have to at least be equal weight, but really it should be a core holding.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index fell 5.9% last week, its biggest one-week drop since November 2022. The index fell 2.7% on Friday in the wake of a disappointing report on the US labor market, which added to broader concerns about the state of the tech trade. Nvidia Corp. was particularly weak, slumping 14% over the week, its biggest drop since September 2022.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nBrazil’s ban of X amid a fight with Elon Musk over disinformation on his prized social-media site offers a cautionary message for other democracies trying to balance freedom of expression with the integrity of information ahead of elections. The federal judge who recently found that Google illegally monopolized the search market said he wants to deliver a decision on remedies by August. Roblox Corp. Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Dave Baszucki announced a new goal for 10% of the global video-game content revenue to flow through the company’s popular gaming platform.

        "title": "Workers at several large US tech companies overwhelmingly back Kamala Harris, data shows",
        "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Workers at many of the largest U.S. tech companies overwhelmingly back Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, according to donation data, even as some of the most powerful tech billionaires have thrown their support to Republican rival Donald Trump.\n\nWorkers at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are donating millions of dollars to the Harris campaign, significantly more than employees who are opting to send money to former President Trump’s camp, according to the data compiled by political watchdog OpenSecrets. The data includes donations made by company employees, owners, and workers' and owners' immediate family members.\n\nHowever, tech billionaires like Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz are rallying behind Trump, citing the former president's stances on the economy, taxes and big business.\n\nThe Nov. 5 presidential election has riven Silicon Valley, once a bastion of democratic and liberal support. Venture capitalist Reid Hoffman from Greylock and entrepreneur Mark Cuban are pledging support for Harris’ White House bid, with hopes of seeing more abortion rights for workers and pro-tech policies.\n\nBut in recent years several other tech leaders have bristled at Democratic President Joe Biden’s business policies, including a broad attack on mergers and acquisitions and clamping down on data privacy.\n\nCompanies themselves can not directly donate to federal campaigns, including presidential ones, according to campaign finance laws. Corporations often donate to congressional and state-level campaigns through political action committees, which are funded by employee donations and limited on how much candidates can receive.\n\n“Many businesses serve customers on both sides of the political aisle, and they don't want to alienate customers by making contributions that support just one party or one candidate in a partisan race,” said Michael Beckel, research director at campaign finance reform nonprofit Issue One. While corporations are blocked from sending money directly to presidential candidates, their employees aren't, and tech employees are overwhelmingly giving to Harris.\n\nEmployees at Alphabet and its subsidiaries, which includes Google, and their family members have donated $2.16 million so far to Harris’ campaign, nearly 40 times as much as Trump has received, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft employees and family members donated $1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Trump’s campaign pulled in $116,000 from Amazon workers and $88,000 from Microsoft workers, as well as their family members.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmployees at Amazon, which is also a top U.S. retailer and the second largest employer in the country, are outpacing donations from other e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail workers.\n\nFor example, Walmart workers have donated a total of $275,000 to both Harris and Trump, with both presidential candidates receiving nearly the same amount in funding. Trump’s campaign is taking in $144,000 from Walmart workers, about $14,000 more than Harris’.\n\nCampaign donations mostly come from corporate employees who have more disposable income than the typical warehouse worker or cashier, said Sarah Bryner, director of research and strategy for OpenSecrets. Bryner said Amazon and other tech company corporate employees often make more money than those at Walmart, giving them more leeway to contribute to political campaigns.\n\nAmazon corporate employees on average make more money than Walmart corporate employees, who are often based in Bentonville, Arkansas. Amazon’s U.S. corporate employees take home an average of $133,000 per year, while Walmart’s corporate workers’ average annual salary is $85,000, according to data from job marketplace ZipRecruiter.\n\nWorkers and family members at Meta and Apple haven’t hit the $1 million mark in donations to Harris yet, but they are continuing the trend of outpacing contributions to Trump. Meta employees have donated $25,000 to Trump compared with $835,000 to Harris, while Apple employees donated $44,000 to Trump compared with $861,000 to Harris.\n\nSilicon Valley has traditionally been seen as more left-leaning in the U.S. In August, more than 100 venture capitalists said in a letter they would support Harris, who has been considered pro-innovation on business and technology.\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google's antitrust trial over online advertising set to begin",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google will face U.S. antitrust prosecutors on Monday in Alexandria, Virginia, where the Justice Department will seek to show the company stifled competition in online advertising technology, in the search giant's second recent showdown with the Justice Department.\n\nProsecutors say Google has largely dominated the technological infrastructure that funds the flow of news and information on websites through more than 150,000 online ad sales every second.\n\nThe case is an important one for efforts by U.S. antitrust enforcers to challenge alleged Big Tech monopolies, which have spanned the administrations of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nProsecutors say Google engaged in a complex scheme to dominate website advertising tools, through acquisitions, restrictions on how customers can use its tools and alleged manipulation of ad auctions.\n\nGoogle denies the allegations, saying they misconstrue lawful efforts to develop its technology and serve its own customers. Prosecutors overlook how the digital advertising market has shifted to apps and connected TV, where Google faces stiff competition, the company has said.\n\nIf U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would later consider prosecutors' request to make Google sell off, at minimum, Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes Google's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.\n\nAccording to research by stock analyst Wedbush, Google's ad tech tools accounted for $20 billion, or 11% of the company's gross revenue in 2020 and around $1 billion, or 2.6%, of operating profit that year.\n\nAd Manager represented 4.1% of revenue and 1.5% of operating profit in 2020, according to Wedbush research and analysis of court documents.\n\nMore recent figures were redacted from court documents.\n\nGoogle's defense team is led by Karen Dunn, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, who has guided debate preparations for several prominent Democrats including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe government's legal team is headed by Julia Tarver Wood, a veteran trial lawyer who joined the Justice Department last year. She previously worked at Paul, Weiss where she represented companies including insurer American International Group, Mastercard and Amazon.com.\n\nThe multiweek trial is expected to feature witnesses from Google and competitors in the digital advertising space such as the Trade Desk, and Comcast as well as publishers including News Corp and Gannett, who prosecutors say were harmed through Google's conduct.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case is one of several challenging alleged Big Tech monopolies.\n\nThe Justice Department won a ruling against Google last month in another case over its dominance in online search, and is separately suing Apple. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is pursuing cases against Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Amazon.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc (GOOGL): Redditors Are Bullish On This AI Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging. Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\n\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\n\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\n“A recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google’s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.”\n\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\n\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\n\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\n\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\n\nA distinguished MIT professor, Frédo Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\n\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\n\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), or simply Google, is a multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, such as online advertising, search engines, cloud computing, hardware, and software. It operates through three main segments, Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.\n\nIt dominates the online search and advertising sector, fueled by its expertise in algorithms and AI, and has a 90% market share in search and over 2 billion users for its advertising products.\n\nThe company's Pixel 9 phones, which have an on-device AI assistant Gemini Nano, are a highlight, but the US Justice Department's potential breakup has pressured the company's shares. 216 hedge funds were long in the company by the second quarter of 2024. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder in the company and has a position worth $8.856 billion.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. During the second quarter, Cloud revenue alone rose 28.8%. The overall revenue growth was 13.59%, with a revenue of $84.74 billion. Google now has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.\n\nThe company's shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Analysts believe Google is one of the cheapest AI stocks due to its potential in GenAI, making it a top AI stock according to Reddit.\n\nIt is investing heavily in GenAI, and CEO Sundar Pichai believes it's improving user satisfaction and increasing search usage, especially among younger users. Google plans to spend $50 billion on AI initiatives by the end of 2024.\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business.

        "title": "Google faces new antitrust trial after ruling declaring search engine a monopoly",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — One month after a judge declared Google's search engine an illegal monopoly, the tech giant faces another antitrust lawsuit that threatens to break up the company, this time over its advertising technology.\n\nThe Justice Department and a coalition of states contend that Google built and maintains a monopoly over the technology that matches online publishers to advertisers. Dominance over the software on both the buy side and the sell side of the transaction enables Google to keep as much as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and advertisers, the government contends in court papers.\n\nGoogle says the government's case is based on an internet of yesteryear, when desktop computers ruled and internet users carefully typed precise World Wide Web addresses into URL fields. Advertisers now are more likely to turn to social media companies like TikTok or streaming TV services like Peacock to reach audiences.\n\nIn recent years, Google Networks, the division of the Mountain View, California-based tech giant that includes such services as AdSense and Google Ad Manager that are at the heart of the case, actually have seen declining revenue, from $31.7 billion in 2021 to $31.3 billion in 2023, according to the company's annual reports.\n\nThe trial over the alleged ad tech monopoly begins Monday in Alexandria, Virginia. It initially was going to be a jury trial, but Google maneuvered to force a bench trial, writing a check to the federal government for more than $2 million to moot the only claim brought by the government that required a jury.\n\nThe case will now be decided by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton and is best known for high-profile terrorism trials including Sept. 11 defendant Zacarias Moussaoui. Brinkema, though, also has experience with highly technical civil trials, working in a courthouse that sees an outsize number of patent infringement cases.\n\nThe Virginia case comes on the heels of a major defeat for Google over its search engine. which generates the majority of the company's $307 billion in annual revenue. A judge in the District of Columbia declared the search engine a monopoly, maintained in part by tens of billions of dollars Google pays each year to companies like Apple to lock in Google as the default search engine presented to consumers when they buy iPhones and other gadgets.\n\nIn that case, the judge has not yet imposed any remedies. The government hasn't offered its proposed sanctions, though there could be close scrutiny over whether Google should be allowed to continue to make exclusivity deals that ensure its search engine is consumers' default option.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeter Cohan, a professor of management practice at Babson College, said the Virginia case could potentially be more harmful to Google because the obvious remedy would be requiring it to sell off parts of its ad tech business that generate billions of dollars in annual revenue.\n\n“Divestitures are definitely a possible remedy for this second case,” Cohan said “It could be potentially more significant than initially meets the eye.”\n\nIn the Virginia trial, the government's witnesses are expected to include executives from newspaper publishers including The New York Times Co. and Gannett, and online news sites that the government contends have faced particular harm from Google's practices.\n\n“Google extracted extraordinary fees at the expense of the website publishers who make the open internet vibrant and valuable,” government lawyers wrote in court papers. “As publishers generate less money from selling their advertising inventory, publishers are pushed to put more ads on their websites, to put more content behind costly paywalls, or to cease business altogether.”\n\nGoogle disputes that it charges excessive fees compared to its competitors. The company also asserts the integration of its technology on the buy side, sell side and in the middle assures ads and web pages load quickly and enhance security. And it says customers have options to work with outside ad exchanges.\n\nGoogle says the government's case is improperly focused on display ads and banner ads that load on web pages accessed through a desktop computer and fails to take into account consumers' migration to mobile apps and the boom in ads placed on social media sites over the last 15 years.\n\nThe government's case “focuses on a limited type of advertising viewed on a narrow subset of websites when user attention migrated elsewhere years ago,” Google's lawyers write in a pretrial filing. “The last year users spent more time accessing websites on the ‘open web,’ rather than on social media, videos, or apps, was 2012.”\n\nThe trial, which is expected to last several weeks, is taking place in a courthouse that rigidly adheres to traditional practices, including a resistance to technology in the courtroom. Cellphones are banned from the courthouse, to the chagrin of a tech press corps accustomed at the District of Columbia trial to tweeting out live updates as they happen.\n\nEven the lawyers, and there are many on both sides, are limited in their technology. At a pretrial hearing Wednesday, Google's lawyers made a plea to be allowed more than the two computers each side is permitted to have in the courtroom during trial. Brinkema rejected it.\n\n“This is an old-fashioned courtroom,” she said.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among the Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years.\n\nGrowing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn’t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly.\n\nPricing Power Remains Critical, Says Legendary Investor\n\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn’t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.\n\nThe veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers.\n\nForecasts for 2024\n\nWall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched.\n\nMoving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points.\n\nEquity Market Outlook Amidst Uncertain Macro-Economic Environment\n\nA “higher-for-longer” backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.\n\nMarket volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.\n\nIn Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that “there is a risk of disappointment.” The large bank expects that the Fed might stay ‘higher-for-longer,’ US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company and the internet media giant, Google, is its wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nThe internet giant enjoys a wide economic moat given its durable competitive advantages, which are derived from its intangible assets, and its network effect. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) possesses significant intangible assets with its overall technological expertise concerning algorithms and AI (machine learning and deep learning), and access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers. Regardless of its actual technological competency, the company’s search engine is regarded as being the most advanced in the industry. As a result of these factors, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retains an impressive share of just over ~80.0% of the global desktop search market.\n\nMoving forward, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s revenues are expected to be primarily supported by continued growth in digital ad spending from Asia-based retailers. Also, YouTube should benefit from strong reach and usage frequency. Its video-only content format is attractive to the brand advertisers.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) should be able to defend its search dominance over the next decade with its own AI technology. The company is focused on investing in AI to drive growth throughout its offerings, such as advertising and Cloud.\n\nAnalysts at Wolfe Research initiated coverage on the shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on 16th July. They gave an “Outperform” rating, with a price target of $240.00 per share.\n\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter and mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first-quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding), and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising, and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well-positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Google is set to face its second antitrust trial since September 2023 against the Department of Justice on Monday, this time over its alleged monopolistic power in the ad-tech industry.\n\nThe DOJ is filing a lawsuit against Google arguing their advertising technology services creates an unequal field for their competitors and has allowed them to create a monopoly in the advertising space, leading to higher ad prices for customers.\n\nFor Google, their ad-tech service revenue accounts for 77% of their total earnings. The tech giant brought in a total of $307 billion in 2023, but $237 billion of that was produced through Google’s advertising services, according to Google’s annual revenue report.

REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo/File Photo\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE RULES GOOGLE VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAW\n\nThis is coming as a judge ruled in August that Google created a monopoly in the search engine space, forcing their competitors such as, DuckDuckGo, Bing and Yelp, to deal with anticompetitive practices. In a failing argument, Google claimed their search engine was such a superior product, and they shouldn’t be held responsible for their competitors' inferior practices, which is a similar argument they are expected to make in this upcoming hearing.\n\nIn the advertising sector of Google, they operate the buying, selling and largest ad exchange, which has many critics saying is an unfair practice. The DOJ cited a Google advertising executive comparing it to \"if Goldman or Citibank owned the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange).\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP 25 May 2023, Berlin: Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, attends a press event to announce Google as the new official partner of the Women's National Team at Google Berlin.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACCUSES GOOGLE OF UNFAIRLY DOMINATING ONLINE SEARCHES IN LANDMARK TRIAL\n\nIn the court filings, the DOJ argued Google, \"forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google’s few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged.\" Google’s response to these claims in the expected arguments they will argue that this lawsuit is a \"Backward looking case\" and \"out of touch with reality.\"\n\nThe trial will be held in Alexandria, Virginia, where the trial is expected to last many weeks.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other American tech stocks.\n\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\n\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\n\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\n\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\n\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\n\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\n% of shares shorted: 0.56%\n\nAlphabet is a consolidation of successful businesses. The company has developed into a true technological giant, producing tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow annually, with products ranging from advertising to cloud computing and self-driving automobiles. Even though the US-based tech company's major search business has been the subject of antitrust worries, investors are still confident in the firm's overall strength and expect the company to continue leading several markets, including search, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and video.\n\nAccording to a UBS research, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ) is a major participant in AI, with the Gemini project boosting intelligence and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud serving as enablers. As a result, the company will be poised to profit from the anticipated $1.2 trillion AI market by 2027.\n\nTo encourage suppliers to source all of their energy from renewable sources by 2029, GOOGL introduced the Google Renewable Energy Addendum. This aligns with Google's 2030 objective of net-zero emissions and a 50% decrease in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions over 2019 levels.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported impressive Q2 2024 results, with diluted EPS growing 31% and revenue rising 15% year over year. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) showed growth of around 29% YoY, solidifying its dominance in the cloud market.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\n\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\n\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\n\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\n\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 216\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $68.7 million\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the mega cap technology firm that primarily earns revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Additionally, the firm also has a key presence in lucrative industries such as video streaming and cloud computing. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s business is still heavily dependent on Search. During Q2, $42.6 billion of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s $72.6 billion in revenue came from Search. This sizeable business allows the firm to command more than 50% of the search advertising market, and it provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) significant leverage with publishers and advertisement companies to divert their transactions through its platform. Additionally, it also has a foundational AI model in the form of Google Bard, which places it at the forefront of AI developments. However, despite its moat, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faces challenges such as purported Justice Department plans to break it up and a growing preference among advertisers to choose focused platforms such as eCommerce websites.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: What I imagined foldables would be like",
        "content": "Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Pixel 9 Pro Fold is here, and the company has a lot to be proud of when it comes to its second-generation foldable smartphone. Well, except for its clumsy name.\n\nFrom its book-like shape and battery life to its cameras, the Pixel Fold is a top-tier smartphone for anyone interested in diving into the world of foldables. But it’s not perfect.\n\nStarting at $1,899, the Pixel Fold is an expensive proposition right up there with Samsung’s similarly designed Galaxy Z Fold 6. That's a heck of a lot more than Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 15 Pro Max, which starts at $1,199, and Samsung’s top-of-the-line non-folding Galaxy S24 Ultra, which costs $1,299.\n\nPrice is a big reason foldables are still niche products compared to standard smartphones. But they have a lot to offer if you're willing to pony up for them, especially the Pixel Fold. In fact, this is easily one of my favorite foldables and the best book-like foldable I’ve used.\n\nSamsung’s clamshell-like Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still one of the most stylish foldables thanks to the fact that it folds like an old-school flip phone. There’s just something about snapping a phone shut when you hang up on someone that makes you feel like a high-powered '90s executive. But I digress.\n\nI’ve been propping up the Pixel Fold on my treadmill’s magazine holder so that I can watch the Mets on its big center display while exercising. And on Thursday, I was able to track my fantasy football teams by running the Yahoo Fantasy Sports and ESPN Fantasy Sports apps side by side on the Fold’s inner screen. Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a foldable 8-inch screen. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nWhile that middle display is certainly useful, it’s not something I’d use every day. In fact, the single biggest reason I prefer the Pixel Fold over Samsung’s rival Z Fold 6 comes down to their cover screens.\n\nThe Pixel Fold has a 6.3-inch front display that’s similar to a standard smartphone, while the Z Fold 6 has a 6.3-inch cover screen that’s just a hair too thin, which makes typing on the keyboard with my chunkier digits feel cramped. My wife, whose fingers are more slender than mine, however, doesn’t have any trouble typing on the Samsung display.\n\nThe Pixel Fold’s inner display is also a bit larger than the Samsug’s foldable screen — 8 inches compared to 7.6 inches — providing a larger canvas to stream shows and multitask. That’s not to say you can’t do the same on the Z Fold 6, but even a smidge more screen real estate makes it easier to read text while using two apps.\n\nOn the camera front, the Pixel Fold gets wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle lenses and a 5x telephoto lens. Samsung’s Z Fold 6 offers a similar camera setup, though it packs a 3x optical zoom. Photos taken with both phones are fantastic thanks to their advanced sensors and capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the Pixel Fold’s performance and power, apps ran without any hiccups, and the battery lasted well throughout the day and then some.\n\nBut the Pixel Fold isn’t flawless. Its speakers aren’t very loud, so if you like using your phone to listen to music out loud, you’ll be left wanting. I use a white noise app to go to sleep at night, and I could hardly hear the sound of the faux box fan thanks to the Pixel Fold’s lackadaisical speakers. In the end, I had to use a secondary phone to play the app’s audio.\n\nGoogle has also positioned the Pixel Fold’s inner selfie camera on the far right top corner of the phone, which makes keeping yourself centered while video chatting via the inner display needlessly difficult. Sure, you can use the front selfie camera (yes, there are two separate selfie cameras) to video chat with friends, but why have that giant foldable screen if you’re not going to use it? Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 is still one of the freshest looking foldables. (Image: Howley) (Howley)\n\nGoogle, like Samsung, has also poured a slew of generative AI features into the Pixel Fold. The AI-powered Pixel Screenshots app is helpful in that it allows you to take screenshots and quickly pull useful information from them by searching for the info you need. For instance, if you see an ad for an upcoming concert, you can screenshot it, and then when you want to remember what day the show is, you can search for the name of the band in the Screenshots app and it’ll give you the info you’re looking for.\n\nGoogle also loads its Gemini assistant onto the Pixel Fold, which provides advanced search and conversation capabilities. But as with other smartphones, I haven’t found much use for the majority of the Pixel Fold’s AI features in my day-to-day life.\n\nThere’s also a Pixel Studio app for making AI-generated art and a generative AI-enhanced weather app that doesn’t add much to the overall experience. In fact, the so-called “AI Weather Report” feels like it takes longer to read than simply looking up the temperature and current conditions.\n\nFor now, at least, it feels like Google is throwing everything AI-related at the wall to see what sticks. There are certainly some smart ideas here, especially with the Pixel Screenshots app, but I’m not sold on things like the Pixel Fold’s Reimagine feature, which is available through its Magic Editor camera app. The software lets you completely change your photo using generative AI.\n\nThe idea is that you can make it appear as though you and your friends were standing in a field of flowers when you took a photo rather than in a Target parking lot. I’m sure it’s fun to play with the feature for the first few days after you get your phone, but I don’t see it as something I’d use every day or week.\n\nBut that’s not why you’d buy a phone like the Pixel Fold. You’re likely considering this phone for its unique design and foldable capabilities. And if that’s the case, and you don’t mind spending an extra chunk of change to get those features, you can’t go wrong with Google’s Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "vladimir putin\n\nThe Kremlin is seeking $235m (£180m) from Google’s bankrupt Russian entity after repeatedly fining YouTube for hosting videos banned by the regime.\n\nUS court records showed that Russia’s tax authority, on behalf of Vladimir Putin’s government, had demanded 21.5bn roubles, equivalent to $235m.\n\nGoogle continues to operate YouTube and other services in Russia, despite its local entity declaring bankruptcy, saying it is one of the few remaining ways people in the country can access information freely.\n\nKeeping services online in Russia has led to the company being hit with millions in fines for refusing to delete what the Kremlin calls “false content”.\n\nThe Russian government is unlikely to be able to seize the funds, with Google’s bankrupt Russian entity having assets of just 3.5bn roubles, around $38.2m.\n\nGoogle Russia declared bankruptcy in 2022. It has subsequently said that Russian authorities seized around $100m in assets from the company, some of which has since gone to pro-Putin broadcasters.\n\nThe fines have emerged in US court documents as part of an international legal battle between Google and three Russian broadcasters including the state-owned RT, previously known as Russia Today.\n\nRT and the pro-Kremlin channels Tsargrad TV and NFPT are pursuing legal action against Google in jurisdictions including Turkey, South Africa and Spain. They are seeking to force the company to pay Kremlin-ordered fines that cannot be recovered from Google’s bankrupt Russian entity.\n\nGoogle is suing the broadcasters in the UK and US, seeking a ruling that action in the other countries is void.\n\nThe US documents, filed by the three Russian broadcasters, say that the majority of the $235m sought by the Kremlin “is mostly comprised of administrative fines imposed on Google in or around 2022 for failure to remove from YouTube videos containing information prohibited for circulation in the Russian Federation and other legal violations”.\n\nIf Russia’s claims are successful, it might mean Google Russia’s remaining funds being distributed to the Kremlin instead of creditors and employees. A bankruptcy hearing is scheduled for October.\n\nGoogle removed RT and other broadcasters from YouTube shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It has been ordered to pay the channels compensation.\n\nRussia has frequently issued fines against Western technology companies for refusing to take down material the government disagrees with.\n\nGoogle has said the fines are an attempt to limit access to the company’s services in Russia.\n\nThe broadcasters have enjoyed some success in targeting funds from Google outside of Russia. NFPT won a preliminary court order in South Africa allowing it to take Google’s assets in the country, while separate hearings are scheduled in Algeria and Turkey.\n\nThe broadcasters have also attempted to launch legal action in Spain, Hungary and Kyrgyzstan.",

These commercials dominated the airwaves when I was in college, and I would argue they put Dell on the map with consumers that barely knew how to use a computer.\n\nI have no idea why the commercials left an impression, but they did.\n\nAll in all, these reminded me that I was now moving closer to being a grey-beard at work.

Just read the company's annual report here and keep scrolling below.\n\nDell was founded in 1984 by then-University of Texas student Michael Dell. It made PCs, a lot of them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough the years, the company has morphed into part PC maker, part tech player integral to the fabric of the world's tech infrastructure. Think servers, storage, and other components for entire countries and companies that I won't bore you listing.\n\nThe company is well beyond integrating its behemoth 2016 acquisition of EMC.\n\nI got to spend 25 minutes with Michael Dell this week in NYC at the Citi TMT conference (video above) and was really blown away by what the company is working on. Was I surprised, full-stop? No, because I still read all of the company's earnings reports and earnings call transcripts. But I was a little surprised to hear how deep the transformation runs at Dell.\n\nOn Friday, S&P Global announced that Dell will join the S&P 500, replacing Etsy, on Sept. 23. The move boosted its shares in extended trading, as the company will soon be in index funds that track the S&P 500. Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, is speaking at the ''New Strategies for a New Era'' keynote at the Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 27, 2024. (Joan Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIt's embarking on its latest transformation for the age of AI. Dell said it secured $3.1 billion of AI server sales in the second quarter, almost double the $1.7 billion netted in the preceding quarter.\n\nSales in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group surged 38% to $11.65 billion. AI sales are captured in this segment.\n\nDell's Client Solutions Group — which includes sales of PCs and laptops — did see sales drop 4% to $12.41 billion. Consumer sales declined 22% to $1.86 billion, while the commercial business was flat at $10.6 billion.\n\nDell tells me the AI PC uptake has been pushed out a bit, but he has 200 million-plus Dell computers (aka the installed base). They will need the AI-powered replacements, and that cash will soon start rolling in.\n\n\"What organizations are seeing is this is a historic opportunity to make their businesses way more productive and efficient [with AI], while, at the same time, kind of reimagining them given all this capability,\" Dell told me.\n\nAnother surprise — at least to me — is how cheap the company is being valued at by the market.\n\nShares of Dell trade on a 13.5x forward PE multiple, according to Yahoo Finance data, well below the S&P 500's 22.5x. I am not saying the company should be valued on par with Nvidia (NVDA) or even a Salesforce (CRM). But assign Dell a reasonable 15x PE multiple on a reasonable $9.40 a share profit estimate for fiscal 2026 (which would represent about 20% earnings growth), and you have a $141 stock.\n\nDell's stock currently trades at $107.\n\nHead-scratching for a company clearly playing a key role in the AI future. Maybe it's a function of its PC exposure.\n\nBefore I venture off to begin shopping for an AI PC, I'd like to note I will be live on Yahoo Finance Monday and Tuesday from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference at the Palace hotel in San Francisco. This is one of my favorite conferences to cover each year, and we have a ton of big ticker-moving interviews lined up.

        "content": "Wall Street veteran Alex Green issues warning to Americans who invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks\n\nFor many investors, stocks that pay dividends represent the height of reliability. Just witness the track records of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and its main competitor PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP): Both rank among the 53 “dividend kings” that have increased shareholder payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nYet the question remains whether paying dividends is really the most resourceful option.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n\"There are some companies that are growing so rapidly that the best use of their cash is not to pay dividends to shareholders or even to buy back their own shares, but to reinvest in their own operations” said The Oxford Club’s Chief Investment Strategist Alex Green in a recent interview with finance YouTuber Ari Gutman.\n\nMarket giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have opted over time for the latter. That sets the stage for more growth, which can in turn lead to higher share prices.\n\nGreen recalled a time more than 24 years ago when he worked on Wall Street and advised a client to buy shares in billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). The client, who was retired, took a pass because they wanted some steady income and the company didn't pay out dividends. (It still doesn't.)\n\n\"Think how well he would have done if he'd have bought those shares of Berkshire and just sold a little bit off each year if he needed some income,\" Green said. “That’s what everyone needs is return, not income.”\n\nWe did the math and since the year 2000, the stock has soared by more than 1,200%.\n\nHow dividends work — and sometimes fall short\n\nA dividend is a shareholder payout companies make, usually on a quarterly basis, based on their profits. Many investors like them because it can act as a steady source of income.\n\nFor example, sitting atop the “dividend kings” utilities sector you’ll find two businesses that have upped their dividend growth for 69 consecutive years: American States Water (NYSE:AWR) and Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN). This is as ranked by Simply Safe Dividends whose tagline says it all: \"We're boring and conservative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet as Green’s too-careful client learned the hard way, boring and conservative can be humbling and costly. Consider the aforementioned Amazon, a high-flying company whose stock is doing better now than it has over the last two years. Since last year, the stock is up by more than 100%.\n\nOut of 65 analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, 54 call it a \"buy.\" And it has never offered a dividend. Compare that to American States Water, whose stock has lowered over the same period.\n\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nSkepticism over dividend-centered investing is nothing new. But it’s not that dividend stocks are bad bets in and of themselves; rather, they can be part of a balanced portfolio that could include even more conservative investments such as bonds and riskier ones such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, tech-sector companies that famously resisted dividends have gotten into the game. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started paying out dividends in 2012, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gave out its first-ever dividends in June 2024.\n\nJust a few months prior, Meta (NASDAQ:META) announced its first dividend effective Feb. 22. In each case, the dividend marked a point where the companies had matured past their go-go stages and had plenty of money to sit on. All three today boast market caps measured in trillions of dollars.\n\nGreen urged investors to think of stocks not just in terms of dividends, which many treat as income, but total returns. If a stock skyrockets, its share price will far outpace even the biggest dividend; in the S&P 500, that's offered by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).\n\n“I have nothing against dividend investing,” he said. “A lot of smart people are dividend oriented and there are a lot of great dividend-paying stocks out there. But I just would warn people not to invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks.”\n\nWhat to read next\n\nUnlock access to 4,700+ hand-picked, single-family homes across America — and the juicy rental cash they can generate.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Should You Buy This ESG Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other ESG stocks.\n\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\n\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\n“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”\n\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\n\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 2.06%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has introduced the Google Renewable Energy Addendum, a new initiative asking its largest hardware manufacturing suppliers to commit to matching 100% of their energy use with renewable sources by 2029. This program is part of Google’s broader effort to reduce its carbon footprint. The company has set ambitious environmental goals for 2030, including achieving net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and reducing its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 50% from 2019 levels. To achieve this, Google plans to invest in both nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to offset any remaining emissions.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) delivered strong Q2 2024 results, with revenue increasing 15% year-over-year and diluted EPS rising 31%. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) saw nearly 29% year-over-year growth, strengthening its position in the cloud market. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, indicating a potential upside of 25.03% as of August 20.\n\nAdditionally, a recent UBS report highlights Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a key player across all three layers of the AI value chain: enabling, intelligence, and application. The company’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform position it as an AI enabler, while its Gemini project strengthens its role in the intelligence layer. These factors suggest the company could significantly benefit from the projected $1.2 trillion AI market opportunity by 2027.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 6th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) ‘Isn’t Buying Because They’re Worried That The Other Guys Might Do Something’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\n“There is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing. Money is just not talked about. Frankly, it’s become the third rail of American education. You’re a thousand times more likely to read Marx’s “Das Kapital” than to read anything about planning a budget or picking stocks.”\n\nCramer’s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\n“That’s why I’m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you’re going to stop working—hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I’m betting most of you, even if you don’t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\n\nDecades ago, corporate pensions started going the way of the dodo, and now the 401(k) is the main way that Americans save for retirement. They’re offered by your employer, and they’re among the greatest tax-deferred investment vehicles out there, along with the IRA. And I’m not talking about the Irish Republican Army—I’m not even talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, for that matter. I mean the Individual Retirement Account.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it’s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\n“Hear me out, darn it—you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there’s a lot the so-called experts don’t tell you or don’t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)—you’d have to be a fool not to contribute.\n\nMany experts will even advise you to max out your 401(k) contributions every year if you can afford to. Right now, the maximum contribution is over 20 grand, with room for an additional 7 grand if you’re over 50. It tends to rise gradually over time, usually a little faster than inflation. In 2004, it was $13,000; by 2023, it was $22,500. Either way, that’s a serious chunk of change, even with these contributions coming from your pre-tax income.”\n\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\n“However, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I’m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it’s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns—sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I’ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)—maybe there’s a better way for you to invest for retirement.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nMarket Capitalization: 1.94T\n\nJim Cramer notes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s recent concerns about not making acquisitions are driven by the fear of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) potentially surpassing them. According to Cramer, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s hesitation is rooted in a specific worry: that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could catch up and overtake Google in the competitive landscape.\n\n“Google isn’t buying because they’re worried that the other guys might do something. They’re specifically worried that Meta is going to catch and pass them and they should be.”\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s latest earnings report reveals a strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $84.7 billion, a 14% increase from the previous year. This growth was fueled by exceptional results in its key areas, such as Search and Cloud. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s operating income surged to $27.4 billion, while net income climbed to $23.6 billion, showcasing significant improvement. The Search business was particularly successful, contributing $73.9 billion in revenue, and YouTube advertising grew by 13% to $8.66 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the Cloud segment performed remarkably well, with revenue increasing by 28.8% to $10.35 billion and achieving over $1 billion in quarterly operating profit for the first time. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s commitment to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) enhances its growth prospects. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s focus on advancing AI within its Search and Cloud services is expected to yield substantial returns as AI becomes more widely adopted across various sectors. While there are some challenges in its Network ads segment, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s strong performance in Search, Cloud, and AI positions it well for ongoing growth and profitability.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Short Sellers Are Bullish On This Cloud Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cloud stocks.\n\nThe cloud computing market is one of the fastest growing in the technology industry as the ubiquity of the internet allows business to digitally outsource their functions to reduce investment costs and access specialized services. Estimates show that the cloud computing market was worth $480 billion in 2022, and despite its heft, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% to be worth a whopping $2.2 trillion by the end of 2032. The three segments of the cloud computing industry are infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS).\n\nREAD ALSO 13 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 8 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\n\nThis market, like other mega technology industries, is dominated by mega cap technology companies. As per research from Gartner, the global IaaS market is dominated by five services as of 2023 end. These are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Aliyun, and Huawei Cloud. Their market shares are 39%, 23%, 8.2%, 7.9%, and 4.3%, respectively, with all other firms commanding 17.6% of the total market. In terms of revenue, AWS raked in an impressive $54.6 billion in revenue, while the others brought in $32.1 billion, $11.4 billion, $11.1 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. AWS' dominance in the industry is clear as it brought in more than twice the revenue of all other firms that follow Huawei since their cumulative revenue was $24.6 billion.\n\nApart from the biggest players, whose valuation metrics are different due to their mature and diverse business models, valuing cloud computing stocks is different from how you'd value other companies. For instance, most firms are valued through their price to earnings (P/E) ratio. This measures the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's earnings, but the ratio becomes useless when we try it to value cloud computing stocks. This is because of the industry's obsession with growth, and its need for high margins, meaning that cloud cloud computing stocks, and particularly SaaS stocks, reinvest large portions of their revenue back into growth.\n\nSo much so that one of the most troubled SaaS companies these days has been aggressively investing in growth despite its shares being down 39.65% year to date. This firm ranks 6th on our list of Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth, with its second quarter product revenue of $868.8 million marking a 28.9% annual growth. However, this growth clearly hasn't been enough, as the stock tumbled by 14.7% after the latest earnings report. During the same period, this firm's marketing and research and development expenses sat at $838.2 million, or 96% of its revenue. This is a classic illustration of the cloud computing industry, and one that requires different valuation metrics than the P/E ratio as these firms are not profitable most of the time.\n\nThe two key metrics for valuing SaaS stocks in particular are the EV/Revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value is its market value plus net debt, and when divided by revenue, the resulting ratio measures the premium that a buyer would be willing to pay for a firm over its ability to generate revenue. The Rule of 40 is simpler, as it simply states that the sum of a SaaS firm's revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40. While this rule is simply a benchmark and not all inclusive of SaaS performance, it does have some key implications. For instance, it implies that if a firm is growing its revenue at or faster than 40%, then it can be unprofitable.\n\nOn the flip side, if growth slows down, to say 10%, then it must be highly profitable with margins of at least 30% to show that the lower growth is accompanied by the benefits of the beefy margins that software companies enjoy. McKinsey also substitutes the profit margin with the free cash flow (FCF) margin to further broaden this rule's scope. A firm's FCF simply eliminates the impact of interest, taxes, and capital expenditure on the net income. As per its analysis, the top Rule of 40 SaaS companies are investor favorites. This is because McKinsey's data shows that in a sample size of 100 SaaS companies, those with the 25 highest Rule of 40 scores had median EV/Revenue multiples of 22. This was nearly 22x the overall sample's 11x, and nearly 3x the bottom 25 firms' median EV/Revenue multiples of 8. In other words, investors are typically willing to pay a higher premium over sales for SaaS firms that have either robust revenue growth, superior cost control, or a mix of both.\n\nFinally, while EV/Revenue and Rule of 40 measure the financial validity and stature of these firms, their stock performance is also tightly linked to the economy and monetary policy. A low interest regime means that businesses can spend more money, which is beneficial for SaaS and cloud computing firms, both. On Wall Street, August has marked a paradigm shift after Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that his organization was satisfied with macroeconomic indicators to cut interest rates. This has also impacted valuations, as the median EV/Sales ratio for the top companies, i.e. Rule of 40 firms with a growth rate higher than 30%, sat at 13.3x as of the latest market close. This is the second highest for the year, with the last high being in May when it sat at 16.3x. This was before a brief rate gloom took over Wall Street in July which saw the flagship S&P index lose 8.5% between mid July and early August.\n\nAny discussion of SaaS stocks would be incomplete without a brief discussion of the implications of artificial intelligence. According to hedge fund Coatue Management, SaaS valuations as measured by forward sales are at a historic low right now through a median of 5.5x. This comes with lower growth expectations, as just 1% of SaaS firms are now seeing a median forward growth estimate of 30%+. As for the business model, SaaS firms are seeing a shift from a traditional seat based model that drove revenue from the number of users that were using the services to a consumption driven model. Their lower growth expectations are also somewhat driven by the belief that AI could allow companies to cost effectively create their own code and thereby reduce their reliance on SaaS and cloud computing providers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the holdings of First Trust's cloud ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short. Then, the stocks with the lowest percentage were selected.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q2 2024: 216\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 0.56%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the mega cap technology giant whose business is fueled by its search engine. Google's Search is the world's largest platform of its kind, and it enables the firm to monetize its traffic to allow businesses to publish advertisements directly on Search and on web properties that have chosen to work with it. Search's size, as evident by its processing of 5.9 million queries per minute provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a wide competitive moat that is the industry's envy. Additionally, its tech driven focus makes it the third biggest cloud company in the world by market share. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Cloud business allows those unwilling to invest in infrastructure to use its hardware for their AI processing. This includes Apple, whose Apple Intelligence is trained on Google Cloud through Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) and leaving NVIDIA out of the equation. However, 2024 has seen threats linger on the horizon for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), in the form of purported anti trust action by the government and AI powered search platforms.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd on our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Do Short Sellers Buy This Autonomous Driving Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy According To Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other autonomous driving stocks.\n\nREAD ALSO 13 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 8 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\n\n2024 is the year of artificial intelligence. The revolutionary new technology that has disrupted the status quo on Wall Street has managed to shift investor attention away from economic turmoil to a specific set of firms that can benefit from the massive expected enterprise spending on accelerated computing and the associated industries needed to enable this shift. This has meant that despite the fact that interest rates have been at a 23 year high, the flagship S&P index is up by almost 44% since the close of 2022 while the tech heavy broader NASDAQ index has gained 63% during the same time period.\n\nOne technology that is part of artificial intelligence is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving, in its simplest form, is built on machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, so, autonomous driving is also artificial intelligence - a fact that is often left underappreciated by the broader media and analyst coverage. Autonomous driving uses neural nets to assimilate existing data and predict the behavior of pedestrians and other drivers. This ability offers the potential to create new industries, particularly where car owners provide their vehicles for autonomous ride sharing to earn money when they don't need their vehicles.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, consumer willingness to rely on shared autonomous vehicles for their trips over trips taken on existing private vehicles has only grown. As an example, its 2022 research showed that 56% of consumers surveyed were willing to use shared autonomous vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and were at least 20% cheaper compared to their private counterparts. Additionally, 34% of those surveyed wanted level 4 (L4) autonomy in their next vehicle purchase. Autonomous driving is categorized across five levels, with level 1 being simple features such as cruise control and level 5 being a fully autonomous system that does not require any human attention or interaction.\n\nMcKinsey estimates that revenue from autonomous ride sharing fleet vehicles such as robotaxis and robo-shuttles could touch $400 billion by 2030, based on statistics such as the German passenger car fleet of 50 million vehicles being parked 95% of the time and offering 250 million seats to meet the entire population's mobility needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, while we'll get to the strides made by Elon Musk's car company on this front later, other car companies have also jumped into the fray. For instance, the second best automotive stock to buy according to hedge funds has teamed up with Goldman Sachs' eighth best hedge fund stock pick through its Cruise business to offer autonomous ride sharing services to customers next year. This will be one of the first robotaxi projects of its kind, and its announcement came months after the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association (AVIA) had shared its first ever State of AV report. It shared that autonomous vehicles have driven nearly 70 million miles on American roads, with most of these being recent as the number of miles driven had marked a 59% growth since July 2023.\n\nWhile big ticket car brands typically dominate the autonomous driving conversation, there are several private and small companies that are also 'driving' the mileage for autonomous vehicles so to speak. One such firm is Nuro, which aims to develop L4 logistics vehicles capable of making deliveries. It tests its products in a closed track in Las Vegas, and the firm has driven one million autonomous miles to date. Another firm is Gatik, which has partnered up with the second best hedge fund eCommerce stock pick and also the biggest brick and mortar retailer in the world. It offers autonomous transportation as a service (ATaaS) by operating box trucks that autonomously ship goods within different supply chain nodes such as fulfillment and distribution centers, stores, and warehouses.\n\nComing back to Elon Musk's car company, autonomous driving and robotaxis are at the center of its valuation, at least as far as RBC Capital and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest are concerned. According to RBC, Robotaxi's revenue can sit at $120 billion in 2040, with the autonomous ride sharing business accounting for 52% of the firm's valuation. Ark, as expected, is more optimistic. Its expected value for the car company's share price is $2,600 in 2029, which will be driven by $8.2 trillion in enterprise value, $1.2 trillion in revenue, and $440 billion in operating income. As per the hedge fund's research, 88%, 63%, and 86% of these values will be driven by Robotaxi.\n\nSince autonomous vehicles require GPUs to train neural networks, and big tech firms' insatiable PGU demand for non-autonomy related AI use cases has made these chips one of the hottest commodities in the world, a shortage in GPUs could impact the projected growth in autonomy. For instance, emails obtained by CNBC in June revealed that Musk had asked his GPU supplier to divert supplies intended for his car company to the social media firm X and AI company xAI. These shipments were worth roughly $500 million, and the latest earnings saw him share that he had no choice but to compete with the world's largest GPU maker.\n\nDuring the call, Musk outlined that since it was hard to procure the \"state-of-the-art\" GPUs, \" when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have — in order to ensure that we’ve got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with \" the GPU company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X's autonomy ETF that are focused on autonomous driving by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 0.56%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 216\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a mega cap technology firm that is one of the industry leaders in artificial intelligence. Like other big tech companies, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also benefits from having access to its own foundational model. Called Gemini, it enables the firm to compete with Microsoft backed OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta, and Amazon's Anthropic at the leading edge of the foundation AI industry. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also has a direct presence in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business division. More than 700 Waymo cars are present in San Francisco alone, and they have also come under criticism for fires, crashes, and traffic violations. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also offers robotaxi services, and Waymo shared in August that it offers 100,000 robotaxi rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, Arizona. Like Baidu in China, this provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) a sizeable lead over rivals and allows it to attune itself to market expectations. However, the bulk of the firm's revenue is from the Google Search business, and any disruption from AI or regulatory or anti trust action from the government could create headwinds for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "For the second time in a year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is going to trial against the US Justice Department to defend its lucrative businesses.\n\nStarting Monday, prosecutors and lawyers for Google are scheduled to give opening arguments in federal district court in Alexandria, Va., in the case that claims Google illegally maintained its dominance in three markets within the ecosystem that automates online advertising.\n\nThe case, to be decided by US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, a Clinton appointee, was brought in January 2023 by the Biden administration’s Justice Department, along with 17 state attorneys general.\n\n“The stakes for both sides are very high,” New York University Law School professor Eleanor Fox said.\n\nThe trial comes just a month after Google suffered a defeat in a high-stakes federal antitrust case brought by the DOJ during former President Donald Trump’s administration. In that case, US District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google illegally monopolized the general online search engine market and the market for search engine text advertising.\n\nGoogle has said it will appeal that decision. Losing round one: Google CEO Sundar Pichai leaves the federal courthouse in Washington during closing arguments in the antitrust case against Google last year. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn the ad tech case, the government claimed Google also deployed illegal methods to monopolize markets for publishing ad servers, ad exchanges, and advertiser ad networks. Together, these markets make it possible for advertisers to buy and publishers to sell digital ads online.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case are allegations that Google foreclosed on competitors by capitalizing on its well-known search engine to enter the online advertising market and then bought up competitors within the space.\n\nFirst in 2000, they said, Google launched Google Ads, previously named AdWords, a platform that allows advertisers to buy ad space on Google’s own web pages, including those that that display internet search results. Later that year, Google created another tool for advertisers to buy ad space on third-party websites.\n\nProsecutors say Google next devised a “moat” around the entire ad tech industry by developing a separate ad server for publishers. Once it had control over both sides of the industry, they alleged, Google positioned itself to extract profits as a middleman.\n\nWhen Google's own ad platforms failed to gain traction, the DOJ said, it turned to buying up rivals.\n\nIn 2008, Google acquired the leading publisher ad server, DoubleClick, for $3 billion, as well as an ad exchange auction platform, AdX.\n\nAccording to the DOJ, Google then blocked publishers who did not use both its publisher-side platform, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange from accessing real-time ad demand exclusive to Google Ads.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In effect, Google positioned itself to function simultaneously as buyer, seller, and auctioneer of digital display advertising,” the complaint said.\n\nCornell Law School antitrust professor Erik Hovenkamp said the allegations in the complaint are serious and compelling without obvious justifications that might excuse the alleged misconduct.\n\n\"As for advertisers and publishers, they are the primary victims of Google's alleged misconduct,” Hovenkamp said.\n\nGoogle did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. In its response to the lawsuit, it criticized the DOJ and states for using antitrust law to try to derail acquisitions that federal regulators already approved.\n\n\"Advertisers and publishers choose Google’s ad tech products because of their quality and Google’s commitment to constant innovation and improvement, not because they have no other choices or are forced to do so,\" Google's court filing states. Round two: Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta is joined by Attorney General Merrick Garland as she speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department to announce a new antitrust lawsuit against Google on Jan. 24, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nAbsent Google’s anticompetitive behavior, prosecutors say website owners would earn more from hosting ads and advertisers would pay less to secure advertising space.\n\nThose financial pressures, they said, cause website owners to turn to subscriptions, paywalls, or alternative forms of monetization.\n\nIt’s unclear how much of Google’s revenue is at risk in the case.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note on Thursday that Google's collection of ad tech products generated $20 billion of gross revenue and just over $1 billion of operating profit in 2020. The figure accounted for 11% of Alphabet's consolidated gross revenue that year. Ives estimated that the technologies likely now generate roughly 8% of Google's gross revenue.\n\nAt the time of the complaint, the DOJ said digital display ads generated more than $20 billion in revenue for US-based publishers. Roughly 5 trillion digital display ads are sold by publishers each year. And for each dollar that flows from advertisers to website publishers through its ad tech tools Google retains 30% or more.\n\nHovenkamp disagrees with speculation that the DOJ's recent victory over Google will help the government in its ad tech case, anticipating that it will have little influence over the decision.\n\n“If you compare the upcoming Google case to the previous one, both the practices and the markets are different. There is no overlap,” he said.\n\nHowever, Fox points out that the DOJ will be able to use many parts of Judge Mehta’s opinion to support claims of Google’s market power and alleged misuse. At the same time, she said, she expects Google to leave no stone unturned to try and show that ad tech markets are competitive and still growing.\n\n“I believe that the DOJ has a strong case for Google’s monopoly power,” she said, adding that she views as particularly strong the government's claims that Google abused its power in the market for advertising exchanges.\n\nIf Google is found liable for violating antitrust law, the DOJ has proposed that the company be required to divest businesses within its suite of ad tech products.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "With the latest round of 13F filings released over the past month, investors and market watchers alike are interested in seeing where the major hedge fund managers are finding value opportunities.\n\nBackground\n\nManagers with more than $100 million in assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. These filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. For second-quarter 2024, that means managers must disclose all qualifying assets held on June 30, 2024 by Aug. 15, 2024. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs, call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts, cash positions, foreign investments and other assets are not included.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nInvestors can take advantage of these 13F filings to create portfolios from managers that have proven past success. Despite the 45-day delay in reporting, research has shown that investing alongside a single manager or group of managers can outperform the market. The key is to identify the best and most consistent funds to copy.\n\nThe statistics in this report are based on our Premium gurus. These gurus are our hand-picked, best-performing value investors that have proven long-term records.\n\nMagnificent 7 stocks make up large portion of the Aggregated Portfolio\n\nThe GuruFocus Aggregated Portfolio, a Premium feature based on these managers' quarterly filings, shows the 10 most broadly held stocks as of the end of the second quarter of 2024 included some Magnificent Seven names that were also popular in the previous quarter, such as software giant Microsoft Corp.

According to GuruFocus Hot Picks, that honor only goes to a handful of companies, including UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM).

While Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD) and Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV) are listed, they were not necessarily sold. Rather, these companies were acquired or merged with other companies and, therefore, are recorded as a sale in our database. As such, News Corp.

        "title": "Missed Out On Nvidia's Run-Up? My Best AI Stock to Buy and Hold.",
        "content": "If you look up \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) in the dictionary, you might just see a picture of the Nvidia logo. I'm obviously kidding, but there's no denying that this business has been the clear poster child of this revolutionary technological trend.\n\nThis AI infrastructure company has been a monster winner. Shares have catapulted 2,560% higher in the past five years, crushing the broader Nasdaq Composite Index by an incredibly wide margin. This means that a $10,000 investment in September 2019 would be worth a whopping $266,000 today.\n\nYou might be discouraged if you missed out on Nvidia's run-up. But perhaps it's time to take a closer look at what I believe to be the best AI stock right now.\n\nNvidia's impressive run\n\nSome investors might believe that Nvidia's huge gains are warranted. The business sells the graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary to power many AI systems. And as companies of all sizes try to position their operations to integrate AI, Nvidia has been the best beneficiary.\n\nAccording to research from Mizuho Securities, Nvidia has between a 70% to 95% share of the market for chips that power AI models. Unsurprisingly, growth has been unbelievable. Revenue increased 122% from $13.5 billion in the year-ago period to $30 billion in the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28).\n\nNvidia is also wildly profitable, posting a 75% gross margin and 62% operating margin in the latest fiscal quarter. It's not a surprise that the market has become incredibly bullish and optimistic about Nvidia's prospects. This is now a $2.7 trillion enterprise.\n\nBut as of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 52. This makes it the second most expensive \"Magnificent Seven\" stock, which isn't an attractive proposition for investors.\n\nAlphabet's enviable position\n\nNvidia gets all the attention when it comes to AI stocks, but investors should look at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). I think it's the best AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nBack in 2001, the business was already utilizing machine learning and AI capabilities in its powerful search engine, helping users with their spelling. And even before OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 kicked off the AI boom, this technology was being developed and integrated in various Alphabet products and services, like providing traffic data in Maps, making it easier to find Photos by searching what's in them, and preventing spam in Gmail.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai positioned the business to be \"AI first\" back in 2016. Nowadays, AI is undoubtedly a part of Alphabet's current DNA. To be clear, the company's first AI steps weren't the smoothest. But its Gemini AI model is working.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone,\" Pichai said on the Q2 2024 earnings call.\n\nAlphabet has unrivaled reach to continue introducing AI features to almost instant adoption. This allows for rapid feedback, which only helps to constantly improve the offerings and bolster Alphabet's competitive positioning.\n\nAnd the business has virtually unlimited financial resources. It generated $54 billion of annualized free cash flow in the second quarter. And Alphabet is currently sitting on a massive net cash balance of $87.5 billion, which gives it the firepower to keep investing heavily in AI.\n\nWhile Nvidia's valuation is steep, that isn't really a concern in this case. Alphabet shares trade for a reasonable P/E ratio of 23. Investors shouldn't overthink it. Alphabet has long been a dominant force in the internet age. And I see this continuing in the years ahead, particularly in a world where AI becomes more prevalent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Judge gives US regulators until December to propose penalties for Google's illegal search monopoly",
        "content": "A federal judge on Friday gave the U.S. Justice Department until the end of the year to outline how Google should be punished for illegally monopolizing the internet search market and then prepare to present its case for imposing the penalties next spring.\n\nThe loose-ended timeline sketched out by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta came during the first court hearing since he branded Google as a ruthless monopolist in a landmark ruling issued last month.\n\nMehta's decision triggered the need for another phase of the legal process to determine how Google should be penalized for years of misconduct and forced to make other changes to prevent potential future abuses by the dominant search engine that's the foundation of its internet empire.\n\nAttorneys for the Justice Department and Google were unable to reach a consensus on how the time frame for the penalty phase should unfold in the weeks leading up to Friday's hearing in Washington D.C., prompting Mehta to steer them down the road that he hopes will result in a decision on the punishment before Labor Day next year.\n\nTo make that happen, Mehta indicated he would like the trial in the penalty phase to happen next spring. The judge said March and April look like the best months on his court calendar.\n\nIf Mehta's timeline pans out, a ruling on Google's antitrust penalties would come nearly five years after the Justice Department filed the lawsuit that led to a 10-week antitrust trial last autumn. That's similar to the timeline Microsoft experienced in the late 1990s when regulators targeted them for its misconduct in the personal computer market.\n\nThe Justice Department hasn't yet given any inkling on how severely Google should be punished. The most likely targets are the long-running deals that Google has lined up with Apple, Samsung, and other tech companies to make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nIn return for the guaranteed search traffic, Google has been paying its partners more than $25 billion annually — with most of that money going to Apple for the prized position on the iPhone.\n\nIn a more drastic scenario, the Justice Department could seek to force Google to surrender parts of its business, including the Chrome web browser and Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones because both of those also lock in search traffic.\n\nIn Friday's hearing, Justice Department lawyers said they need ample time to come up with a comprehensive proposal that will also consider how Google has started to deploy artificial intelligence in its search results and how that technology could upend the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle's lawyers told the judge they hope the Justice Department proposes a realistic list of penalties that address the issues in the judge's ruling rather than submit extreme measures that amount to “political grandstanding.”\n\nMehta gave the two sides until Sept. 13 to file a proposed timeline that includes the Justice Department disclosing its proposed punishment before 2025.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The federal judge who recently found that Google illegally monopolized the search market said he wants to deliver a decision on remedies by August.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWorld's Second Tallest Tower Spurs Debate About Who Needs It The Plan for the World’s Most Ambitious Skyscraper Renovation Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\n\nJudge Amit Mehta pushed back on the government’s request to give it more time to share with the Alphabet Inc. unit its proposed recommendations for bringing competition back to the market. He asked at a hearing Friday in Washington that the Justice Department file its proposed remedies by the end of the year to give Google a fair chance to respond.\n\n“Google needs to know precisely what plaintiffs want. That needs to be both precise and detailed,” Mehta said.\n\nAfter a 10-week trial, Mehta concluded in August that Google blocked out competition through exclusive deals that involved $26 billion in payments mostly to Apple Inc. to make its search engine the default on smartphones and web browsers. Those distribution agreements allowed Google to corner the market and keep raising prices for online advertising, Mehta said.\n\nGoogle has said it plans to appeal the decision.\n\nThe Justice Department had asked Mehta to file suggestions for remedies in February after it could gather more facts. Its proposed schedule stretches into April when it requested an evidentiary hearing.\n\nDavid Dahlquist, a Justice Department attorney, said during the hearing that the government wants to find out how Google plans to incorporate artificial intelligence into its search engine and what the company has done with its distribution contracts.\n\nJohn Schmidtlein, an attorney for Google, said the company would likely seek information on Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI. Google earlier offered to submit its proposed remedies on Oct. 11 and asked that the Justice Department be required to file its recommendations on Sept. 20.\n\nMehta has given the parties until next Friday to come up with a proposed schedule for the remedies trial.\n\nIt’s unclear which remedies the government will seek. Bloomberg previously reported that the Justice Department is weighing whether to recommend a breakup of Google, which would mark the first attempt to dismantle a company for monopolization since its failure to break apart Microsoft two decades ago. If the judge approves of a breakup, it would be the biggest of a US company since the dismantling of AT&T in the 1980s.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe government is likely to ask for a ban on the types of exclusive contracts that were featured in the trial. It could also ask for less severe measures than a breakup, including a requirement for Google to share more data with competitors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street The Average American Eats 42 Pounds of Cheese a Year, and That Number Could Go Up Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Slumped on Friday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's all about the economy\n\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\n\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\n\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\n\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\n\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote –- that a recession could still occur.\n\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI opportunity\n\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\n\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\n\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\n\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards. Meta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms. Tesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity. Amazon stock is selling for less than 3 times sales, which is also an appealing price. Tesla stock is expensive no matter how you slice it, at 90 times forward earnings and 7 times sales, so it isn't for every investor.\n\nThat said, if Tesla is the first to crack the code for self-driving cars, its current valuation may end up being meaningless.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AI Unicorns Are Being Gutted As Big Tech Poaches Talent And Even Founders. FTC Boss Warns Of A 'Risk Of Monopolization'\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is seeing a major power shift. Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are quietly picking off talent and technology from promising AI startups without fully buying them out. These companies, often called “AI unicorns” because of their billion-dollar valuations, are being hollowed out as their top executives, key engineers, and even founders are hired away by tech giants looking to dominate the AI race.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\n\nBig Tech’s Strategy is Poaching, Not Acquiring\n\nInstead of fully buying these startups, Big Tech is making deals to use their technology and hire their top employees. This helps them avoid the government scrutiny that comes with big mergers while still getting the best people in the AI industry.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a deal with AI startup Inflection, paying $650 million to use Inflection's AI models and hiring almost all of the startup's employees, including its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman.\n\nAmazon is doing the same with Adept, another high-profile AI startup, hiring its CEO David Luan and several other top executives while licensing the company’s AI technology.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nThese types of deals let Big Tech expand its AI capabilities quickly without the hassle of a full takeover, which attracts government crackdowns. Nevertheless, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is already looking into whether Microsoft's deal with Inflection and Amazon’s with Adept were set up to avoid antitrust regulations.\n\nApart from the FTC inquiry, at least three U.S. Senators have also called for an investigation.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan is warning that these talent-poaching deals are a way for Big Tech to sidestep competition and could result in monopolization. “At this moment, AI is a nascent technology that could catalyze enormous growth and innovation. There’s an enormous opportunity here for a vibrant market, but we also see risk. We see a risk of consolidation. We see the risk of monopolization,” Khan said.\n\nIf a few dominant players control most of the talent and technology, smaller companies might not get a chance to thrive.\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Are AI Startups Selling Out?\n\nSo, why are these AI unicorns giving up their talent and tech? The truth is that many of these startups are struggling to make money. For example, Character. AI, once valued at $1 billion, had trouble generating revenue despite its popularity. And now, Google has appointed Noam Shazeer, the former head of the AI startup and a longtime Google researcher, to co-lead its main AI project, Gemini, along with a handful of other employees.\n\nCreating advanced AI models requires huge amounts of computing power, which is very expensive. Startups that can’t afford these costs often seek help from Big Tech. These deals provide a lifeline, helping the startups survive while giving tech giants access to the latest AI technology and the skilled people needed to develop it.\n\nTrending: The startup behind White Castle's favorite Robot Fry Cook announces a next-generation fast food robot – Here's how to get a share for under $5 today.\n\nIn many cases, the founders and top executives of these startups get cushy roles at companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are left trying to pick up the pieces.\n\nInvestors who initially backed these startups are also left with smaller returns than they were hoping for. As a result, some AI unicorns are being reduced to the shadows of their former selves, operating without their best minds or enough resources to compete with Big Tech.\n\nBig Tech has a long history of finding ways to stay ahead of regulators, and we’ll have to see whether the government will act swiftly enough to prevent further consolidation in the AI space.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Unicorns Are Being Gutted As Big Tech Poaches Talent And Even Founders.

        "title": "Google accused of ripping off publishers by abusing advertising market",
        "content": "Google logo on a phone and a laptop\n\nGoogle has been accused by the competition watchdog of abusing its dominance over the online advertising market to overcharge online publishers.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued the search giant with a statement of objections on Friday after an investigation found that it may be acting illegally.\n\nIt comes days before the company faces a US trial over similar claims next week.\n\nThe CMA case, which follows similar action in the US and EU, is the latest challenge to Google’s grip over online advertising.\n\nThe regulator said Google’s control over multiple stages of the online advertising “stack” – the split-second auction system by which adverts are placed on web pages – allowed it to charge publishers higher fees and demote rival advertising services.\n\nGoogle has a majority market share over the advertising servers that sell space, as well as the online exchanges where adverts are bought and sold. Advertisers spend billions of pounds annually on display adverts.\n\nJuliette Enser, the CMA’s interim executive director of enforcement, said: “Many businesses are able to keep their digital content free or cheaper by using online advertising to generate revenue. Adverts on these websites and apps reach millions of people across the UK – assisting the buying and selling of goods and services.\n\n“That’s why it’s so important that publishers and advertisers – who enable this free content – can benefit from effective competition and get a fair deal when buying or selling digital advertising space.”\n\nCMA urged to take quick action\n\nThe News Media Association, which represents British news organisations including The Telegraph, urged the CMA to take quick action against the company under new competition laws that create a specialist digital markets unit within the watchdog.\n\nOwen Meredith, chief executive of the News Media Association, said: “In order to tackle these damaging impacts on our creative sectors, we need the new digital markets regulator to start its work investigating the large tech platforms as quickly as possible, with Google Search and Google ad tech as top priorities for designation.\n\n“By levelling the playing field, we can create a digital economy for the UK which fosters genuine competition, powering growth in these critical markets.”\n\nGoogle hit out at the charges. Dan Taylor, its vice president of global ads, said: “The core of this case rests on flawed interpretations of the ad tech sector. We disagree with the CMA’s view and we will respond accordingly.”\n\nThe CMA can fine Google or order it to cease anti-competitive conduct. The European Commission has said Google might have to be broken up to address the issue.\n\nGoogle will seek to defend its position in a US courtroom on Monday against anti-monopoly charges brought by the Department of Justice. It comes after the company lost a separate competition case over its dominance of the search engine market last month.",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 points to a change of +31.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $292.3 billion and $325.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14% and +11.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Google is blasted by UK watchdog for what it calls anti-competitive behavior through digital ads",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Google was slammed Friday by U.K. regulators who say it's taking advantage of its dominance in digital advertising to thwart competition in Britain, ratcheting up pressure that the tech giant is facing on both sides of the Atlantic over its “ad tech” business practices.\n\nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority said that the U.S. company gives preference to its own services to the detriment of online publishers and advertisers in Britain's 1.8 billion pound ($2.4 billion) digital ad market.\n\nGoogle is a major player throughout the digital ad ecosystem, providing servers for publishers to manage ad space on their websites and apps, tools for advertisers and media agencies to buy display ads, and an exchange where both sides come together to buy and sell ads in real time at auctions.\n\n“We’ve provisionally found that Google is using its market power to hinder competition when it comes to the ads people see on websites,” the watchdog's interim executive director of enforcement, Juliette Enser, said in a press release.\n\nThe watchdog’s charges, known as a statement of objections, come two years after it opened its investigation. The European Union's antitrust authorities have also been Google's ad bidding services while and it has also been the focus of a state-led antitrust lawsuit against Google that’s set to go to trial this month.\n\nThe CMA said that Google's “anti-competitive\" conduct is ongoing, but the company disputed the allegations Friday.\n\n“Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector,” the company said in a prepared statement. \"The core of this case rests on flawed interpretations of the ad tech sector. We disagree with the CMA's view and we will respond accordingly.”\n\nThe U.K. watchdog alleged Google has been exploiting its dominance since 2015 to strengthen the market position of its own AdX ad exchange and protect it from rivals. AdX is where Google charges the highest fees in the ad tech system, taking about 20% of the amount from bids, the CMA said.\n\nThe regulator's accusations include charges that Google manipulates advertiser bids so they have higher value when they go into AdX auctions then rival exchanges. AdX also gets to bid first in auctions run by Google's publisher ad server, potentially shutting out rivals from the chance to bid, the watchdog said.\n\nGoogle now has the chance to reply to the charges. The CMA said its considering what is needed to make sure Google ceases the anti-competitive practices. It has the power to impose a fine worth up to 10% of a company's annual worldwide revenue.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘We Own Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) For The CNBC Investing Club’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn’t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let’s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don’t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\n\nSo, can I just take a moment to speak some words that we all believe but very rarely get to say in polite conversation? Look, money's important. It's really important. And caring about the state of your finances does not make you seem like some sort of superficial bourgeois monster. Say you’ve got a lousy credit score and you want to get married—congratulations, you've just inflicted your horrible credit on your new spouse. Now neither you nor your partner will be able to qualify to buy a car or a home or perhaps even just get a darn credit card.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\n\nSo let me answer one of the most important questions out there: What the heck should young people do with their money? First, foremost, and always, you need to invest. That's the only way you're going to be able to achieve financial freedom. And by freedom, I mean living a life where you're not totally dependent on the next paycheck. Teaching you how to do this is one of the reasons I actually put so much time and energy into creating the CNBC Investing Club. I'm always thrilled when I see younger members taking an active hand in managing their own money.\"\n\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they’re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\n\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it’s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\n\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\n\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\n\"Here’s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\n\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. As the company prepares to defend ad business practices at an antitrust trial, Wall Street analysts continue to be cautiously optimistic on the shares. Morgan Stanley recently lowered the price target on the stock to $190 from $205 and kept an Overweight rating, noting that the tech giant maintains its monopoly in two product markets - general search services and general search text advertising - through its exclusive distribution agreements. Per the advisory the three primary issues the DOJ and judge are focused on solving through remedies include competitive intensity, data scale advantages and anti-competitive pricing.\n\nIn the investor note, Morgan Stanley analysts detailed that they had examined four reasonable outcomes from the trial against Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and estimates suggested that FY28 EBIT impacts from these scenarios would range from plus 15% to negative 23%. However, the advisory cautioned that long-term uncertainty would keep the stock's multiple lower and range-bound.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nDespite the significant growth and investor interest in artificial intelligence stocks, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday the sector is not in a speculative bubble, unlike previous technology booms such as the late 1990s internet bubble.\n\nYet the analysts highlight the importance of diversification given the high concentration risk among leading tech companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe extraordinary performance of tech stocks in recent years has been justified by their earnings, said Goldman stategist Peter Oppenheimer.\n\nGlobal tech earnings per share have risen by approximately 400% since the global financial crisis, while non-tech sectors achieved a comparatively modest 25% increase, he said.\n\n“The technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to continue to dominate returns,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nTech Valuations Remain Reasonable: Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs highlights a key difference between the AI-driven rally and previous market bubbles.\n\nThe valuations of major tech players are significantly lower than those of tech stocks during past speculative phases.\n\nFor instance, while the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — account for over 30% of the S&P 500's market weight (compared to 19% for tech giants in the 2000s), they trade at nearly half the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seen in the prior dot-com bubble.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($bn) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Apple 7.3 3,387 26.5 7.7 Microsoft 6.6 3,043 25.7 9.4 NVIDIA 5.7 2,649 24.1 13.2 Amazon 4.0 1,850 25.4 2.5 Alphabet 3.9 1,808 16.6 2.0 Meta Platforms 2.4 1,118 19.2 5.5 Tesla 1.4 672 55.4 4.9 Magnificent 7 31.3 14,527 23.9 5.0\n\nIn contrast, tech giants during the 2000s dot-com bubble were trading at much higher multiples. Cisco Systems, for example, had a forward P/E of 101.7, while Intel‘s was 42.1, significantly inflating their valuations relative to the broader market.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($B) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Microsoft 4.5 581 53.2 19.2 Cisco Systems 4.2 543 101.7 17.5 Intel 3.6 465 42.1 N/A Oracle 1.9 245 84.6 N/A IBM 1.7 218 23.5 28 Lucent Technologies 1.6 206 37.9 N/A Nortel Networks 1.5 199 86.4 N/A 2000 Bubble Leaders 19.0 2,457 52.0 N/A\n\nDiversification: Key To Reduce Major Volatility Events\n\nThe Goldman Sachs equity team is flagging the concentration risks that come with this tech dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a few stocks dominate market returns, the potential for “stock-specific mistakes” increases, exposing the broader market to severe corrections, Oppenheimer said. For instance, before the July market correction, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 50% of the S&P 500's total returns for the year.\n\n“A market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation,” he said.\n\nA risk also exists that heightened competition and new entrants into the AI space could compress margins and slow growth for the market leaders.\n\nGoldman Sachs recommends seeking opportunities beyond the tech behemoths, particularly in smaller tech companies and sectors tied to infrastructure spending, which may benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe growth of infrastructure capex could boost old-economy industries that incorporate AI technologies into their operations, the firm said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Could Face Major Swings Under Harris Or Trump Tax Plans, Goldman Sachs Warns\n\nPhoto via Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Russia Used a Fake Investor to Dupe Influencers, US Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Eduard Grigoriann was a picture of wealth and sophistication. In a moody image that accompanies his resume, he’s wearing a dark blazer, jeans and gazing out the window of a private jet. Through his globe-trotting, the Brussels-born financier and philanthropist had become attuned to bias in mainstream media, the resume said. He was looking to fix this by starting a conservative news outlet better aligned with his “distinctive and alternative perspectives.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads How Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Madrid to Ban E-Scooter Rentals, Following Lead Set in Paris Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat World's Second-Tallest Tower Tests Malaysia's Appetite for More Skyscrapers\n\nAccording to US authorities, Grigoriann’s perspective was Russian and Grigoriann himself a fake, part of an elaborate scheme by the Russian government to use US influencers to spread propaganda and deepen divisions in American society.\n\nThe Grigoriann persona is central to an alleged plot laid out in indictments that were made public Wednesday, charging two employees of state-controlled Russian media outlet RT with money laundering and being unregistered foreign agents. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, RT has ceased formal operations in the US, UK, the EU and Canada, and in response, created an “empire of covert projects” to shape public opinion in the West, according to US prosecutors.\n\nIn one of those schemes, the RT staffers used the fictional European investor and a network of shell companies to funnel nearly $10 million to an unnamed American media firm that publishes videos on social media channels such as TikTok, Instagram, X and YouTube, and that paid influencers to produce videos, court records show. The views expressed in the videos aren’t uniform, according to the US, but are “often consistent” with the Russia government’s interests.\n\nTwo of the influencers recruited to the company were deceived about the true source of its funding, the US said.\n\nCourt records don’t identify the media company by name, but the descriptions it offers match Tennessee-based Tenet Media, which has a roster of right-wing influencers including Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin and Tim Pool.\n\nTenet and Liam Donovan, who describes himself as its president on X, didn’t respond to requests for comment. But after the indictments were made public, several of the people listed as “talent” on its website distanced themselves from the firm and denied being directed or influenced by Russia.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Never at any point did anyone other than I have full editorial control of the show and the contents of the show are often apolitical,” Pool wrote in a post on X.\n\nJohnson also posted about the indictments on X, saying, “We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme.” Rubin said he “knew absolutely nothing about any of this fraudulent activity.”\n\nPool, Rubin, Johnson and the other three people listed as producing content for Tenet didn’t respond to emails and phone calls seeking comment.\n\nWhile the effort was foiled months ahead of the November presidential election, the scheme highlights the evolving tactics the US says Russia is prepared to use, including funding home-grown media personalities whose views serve Moscow.\n\nJames Lewis, senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Justice Department’s indictment showed that Russian President Vladimir Putin spent $10 million on a plan that could potentially sway the election, further divide Americans and reduce support for Ukraine.\n\n“The Russians take advantage of the First Amendment. There’s no penalty, and they have these groupies so why stop?” he said, in an email. “It’s a cheap way to sway the election, and it’s more effective than anyone would like.”\n\nBrian Liston, a senior analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future Inc., said in an email, “Using unwitting individuals and manipulating the trust of their substantial audiences is another classic Russian influence tactic with an established pattern.\n\n“As we would expect, Russian influence operations are adapting to an evolving media landscape by focusing on non-traditional media versus standard media consumption,” he added. “This has the potential for Russian propaganda messaging to reach younger and more politically engaged audiences.”\n\nThe indictment describes the company involved in the plot as based in Tennessee and using “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.” Tenet, which is based in Tennessee, uses the same language on its website.\n\nProsecutors say that the RT employees’ efforts to recruit influencers began in late 2022, when supposed representatives of Eduard Grigoriann began negotiating terms of payment with one of the founders of the Tennessee-based online content company. By early the next year, the indictment says, the founder was soliciting commentators, using the resume depicting Grigoriann as a jet-setting financier for recruitment.\n\nThe resume, which is reproduced in court documents, describes Grigoriann as having been born in Brussels in 1975 to a Belgium mother and French-Armenian father. While wooing the influencers, both media company founders presented Grigoriann as their backer. But the indictment says they knew the money was actually coming from Russia.\n\n“I’m gonna ask the russians about hiring [a producer] this coming week,” one founder wrote to another on the messaging platform Discord in May 2023, according to the court document. The indictment doesn’t identify the company’s founders. It says the two founders are foreign nationals who reside in the US and jointly operate the online media company. It also says that prior to operating the company for RT, they worked directly for the Russia media outlet and its affiliates.\n\nLauren Chen, who describes herself as Donovan’s wife on X, has a large online following for her political and social commentary. RT’s website also lists her as a contributor.\n\nIn September 2023, Chen posted on X looking for a video editor and telling people interested to email Donovan. Chen didn’t respond to requests for comment via email and her website. Her latest RT piece is from Feb. 2022 and is titled, “If you’re American and oppose war with Russia, expect to be smeared as unpatriotic.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘They Have Stolen Our Business’: When You Leave Russia, Putin Sets the Terms How Local Governments Got Hooked on One Company’s Janky Software Howard Lutnick Emerges as Trump’s No. 1 Salesman on Wall Street Justice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Facebook, Google, YouTube, Big Pharma And IRS Top His List\n\nGrant Cardone, a well-known real estate mogul and Donald Trump supporter, has recently aroused controversy by urging his followers to “quit doing business with the enemies.” Cardone's tweet, which names companies like Facebook, Google, YouTube, Big Pharma, and the IRS, has sparked many reactions.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communitiesnow harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nQuit doing business with the enemies l.\r\nWho's on the list?\r\nFacebook & instagram\r\nGoogle & YouTube\r\nBig Pharma\r\nFunding irs\r\nFunding wars \r\n\r\nWhat else\n\n— Grant Cardone (@GrantCardone) August 31, 2024\n\nAs expected, his followers gave mixed responses. Some were confused and wondered how they could realistically stop using these companies. One follower even joked, “Do I have to give up YouTube? That's where I learned how to replace my toilet.\"\n\nTrending:General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nSome pointed out the irony of quitting platforms like Google and Facebook, given how essential they are to modern life and business. One person commented, “I wish I could quit Google, but that’s where I get all my business.”\n\nOthers were more skeptical, suggesting Cardone's message was contradictory since he uses social media to spread his ideas: “Man, you are on IG, Facebook, YouTube, and everywhere. WTF are you talking about?”\n\nSee Also:These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion –they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nAnother asked him whether he’s “leaving those platforms and no longer taking medicine.\" Most of the medicines we take today come from the pharmaceutical industry, which operates just like any other business.\n\nNevertheless, some of Cardone’s followers took his message at face value and suggested even more companies should be avoided. They mentioned everything from Dunkin', TikTok, and Levi's to energy drinks, fast food chains and Yeti products, adding to the list of businesses they see as harmful or too powerful.\n\nOf course, responses also included Cardone Capital and even Cardone himself as brands people should avoid.\n\nTrending:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividendswould you invest in it?\n\nCardone's message oversimplifies a complex issue. Many of the platforms and companies he labels as “enemies” are deeply embedded in everyday life, and he himself relies on them to build his brand and connect with his audience. It’s no wonder that some of his followers wonder if his message is more about getting attention than providing practical and sincere advice.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a recent post on X, Cardone also shared 11 ideas to improve America, including banning elected officials from stock trading, implementing flat or zero taxes, stopping funding wars, and enforcing laws.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\n\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. There are very few tech stocks who have diversified in the manner that Alphabet has over the past few years. AI-related capital expenditures are another demonstration of this fact. The strong advertising and cloud business of the firm drive stable growth, while investments in the latest technology help the firm maintain a market-leading position in the tech world. The stock has returned handsomely, growing by more than 380% over the past decade. This represents a compound annual growth rate of over 19%.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is aggressively marketing Gemini, the virtual assistant powered by advanced AI features. New updates were recently released for this. Per Google, the new features allow users to customize Gemini to create personal AI experts on any topic. The firm, which offers advanced, business, and enterprise features for Gemini, is planning to launch the assistant in new languages as well.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By James Pearson\n\n(Reuters) - The White House, aiming to persuade U.S. tech giants to offer more digital bandwidth for government-funded internet censorship evasion tools, held a meeting with representatives of Amazon.com, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare and others on Thursday.\n\nThe tools have seen a surge of usage in Russia, Iran, Myanmar and authoritarian states that heavily censor the internet.\n\nThe pitch to tech companies was to help offer discounted or heavily subsidized server bandwidth to meet the fast-growing demand for virtual private network (VPN) applications funded by the U.S.-backed Open Technology Fund, the organisation’s president, Laura Cunningham, told Reuters.\n\n“Over the last few years, we have seen an explosion in demand for VPNs, largely driven by users in Russia and Iran,” Cunningham said. “For a decade, we routinely supported around nine million VPN users each month, and now that number has more than quadrupled.”\n\nVPNs help users hide their identity and change their online location, often to bypass geographic restrictions on content or to evade government censorship technology, by routing internet traffic through external servers outside of that government’s control.\n\nThe OTF specifically backs VPNs that are designed to work in states that restrict access to the internet. The U.S. injected increased funding into VPNs supported by the OTF following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Reuters exclusively reported at the time.\n\nThe organisation has since received a boost to its budget from the U.S. State Department via its “Surge and Sustain Fund for Anti-Censorship Technology”, an initiative created at the Biden administration’s Summit for Democracy.\n\nBut it has struggled to meet increased demand in countries like Russia, Myanmar, and Iran, where internet censorship heavily restricts access to outside information.\n\nAround 46 million people a month now use U.S.-backed VPNs, Cunningham said, but added that a sizeable chunk of the budget was taken up by the cost of hosting all that network traffic on private sector servers.\n\n“We want to support these additional users, but we don't have the resources to keep up with this surging demand,” she said.\n\nRepresentatives of Amazon Web Services, Google, and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.\n\nA Cloudflare spokesperson said the firm was working with researchers to \"better document internet shutdowns and censorship.\"\n\n(Reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Bill Berkrot)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet Remains Core Tech Bet But Regulatory Risks and AI Uncertainties Loom: Analysts\n\nAnalysts re-rated Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Thursday.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan initiated coverage on Alphabet with a Neutral rating and a price target of $190. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt reiterated Alphabet with an Outperform rating and a $205 price target.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald: Mathivanan noted that Google should remain at the core of a growth-oriented technology, media, and telecom (TMT) portfolio. However, the analyst noted limited upside to both Street estimates and valuation multiples in the next 12-18 months.\n\nGoogle’s core Search revenue growth has accelerated over the last five quarters to exceed +15% in constant currency in the second quarter. As per the analyst, while growth should decelerate from here, Search should steadily benefit from query volume growth and monetization gains over the next few years.\n\nHe said that share loss to competition, directly and indirectly, appears minimal so far. Early feedback on generative AI User experience (UX) appears positive and enables Google to mitigate use-case erosion.\n\nAccording to fundamentals, the core search business has several levers to grow, plus double digits in fiscals 2024 and 2025, Mathivanan writes.\n\nHowever, recent regulatory setbacks bring plenty of medium-long-term uncertainties while search UX transforms with expensive AI deployments.\n\nAdditionally, fiscal 2023 EPS growth will likely face headwinds from accelerating infrastructure costs and headcount additions.\n\nGoogle stock is currently trading at 19x fiscal 2025 EPS, a discount to mega-cap peers, which he noted as unlikely to change while near-term regulatory and AI-related uncertainties linger. Mathivanan projects third-quarter revenue of $85.5 billion and EPS of $1.86.\n\nWedbush: On September 9, the second antitrust trial against Google in 2024 will commence in the U.S. District Court, Devitt noted.\n\nThe U.S. DOJ complaint primarily focuses on Google’s ad tech stack, specifically Google Ad Manager. Devitt flagged the DOJ’s complaint proposing the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager Suite but does not identify other areas of the ad tech stack as specific targets for divestiture.\n\nThe analyst noted that Google Ad Manager represented only 4.1% of revenue and 1.5% of the operating profit of the consolidated Alphabet business in 2020.\n\nWhile the analyst acknowledged near-term headline risk associated with the pending trial, he noted the overall risk to the industry is limited based on the company’s recent financial disclosures related to its ad tech products.\n\nPrice Action: GOOGL stock is up 0.20% at $156.77 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOGL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 MKM Partners Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Piper Sandler Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Alphabet Remains Core Tech Bet But Regulatory Risks and AI Uncertainties Loom: Analysts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Rubrik RBRK is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Sept. 9.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal second quarter, RBRK expects revenues in the range of $195-$197 million.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is pegged at $195.58 million.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at a loss of 49 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days.\n\nRubrik, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Rubrik, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nRubrik, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rubrik, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for RBRK prior to this announcement:\n\nFactors to Note for Rubrik\n\nRubrik’s second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from its growing client base and increased demand for its data security solutions.\r\n\r\nFollowing a robust fiscal first-quarter performance, wherein subscription revenues surged 59% year over year to $172.2 million, Rubrik is set to maintain strong momentum driven by its strong partner base and increasing adoption of its solutions.\r\n\r\nRubrik’s expanding clientele, which includes major industry players like Crowdstrike CRWD, Kyndryl KD and Alphabet’s GOOGL cloud business, Google Cloud, is likely to have driven growth during the fiscal second quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, RBRK announced its partnership with CrowdStrike to enhance data security by integrating the Rubrik Security Cloud with CrowdStrike’s Falcon XDR platform, enabling faster detection and prevention of attacks on sensitive data. Benefits from this partnership are likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s performance.\r\n\r\nRubrik also announced a global strategic alliance with Kyndryl to co-develop and launch Kyndryl Incident Recovery with Rubrik, a fully-managed solution offering data protection, cyber incident recovery and disaster recovery for cloud and on-premises workloads. This partnership is expected to strengthen Rubrik’s position in the market and attract additional clientele in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nIn August, the company announced a new partnership with Mandiant, part of Alphabet’s Google Cloud, integrating threat intelligence and incident response to enhance cyber recovery and resilience. The integration with Google Cloud’s expertise and capabilities is expected to have amplified Rubrik’s growth further and solidify its role as a leading provider of data security solutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Rubrik faces stiff competition from data management and protection vendors, including Cohesity, Commvault, Veeam, IBM and Dell EMC, which is expected to have negatively impacted top-line growth for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nRubrik currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "This NFL season is about to show how fast the sports TV landscape is changing",
        "content": "It was only three years ago the NFL signed a media rights deal that welcomed Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) into the fold as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAt the time, the $13 billion, 11-year deal was viewed as a disruptive force that would forever alter the state of television and the status quo of sports media rights.\n\nBut more than any other major league, the NFL loves television and its wide distribution. Case in point: Within its new media rights deal was news the NFL would return to Disney's (DIS) ABC network on Monday nights, with the network also airing the Super Bowl in 2027 and 2031, ending what will be a 21-year absence.\n\nThe league also kept its primary packages in place with CBS (PARA), Fox (FOXA), and NBC (CMCSA). Moreover, the Amazon games are still broadcast over the air for free on local networks.\n\n\"The model for us, today at least, is we want to be on linear and digital,\" Hans Schroeder, executive vice president and COO of NFL Media, told Yahoo Finance. \"Streaming is clearly continuing to grow, and I think that'll be a bigger and bigger part of our future as we look forward.\"\n\n\"But to us, it's not an 'either-or' ... Pay TV is under a tremendous amount of pressure, but we've always been more tethered to broadcast and free to air.\"\n\nHistorically, the NFL has been careful not to place too much of itself and its games behind a paywall.\n\nYet, in the last two seasons, that strategy has begun to shift in what the league describes as \"the next step\" of its product.\n\nNetflix (NFLX), which previously said it wasn't interested in the business of live sports, inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air Christmas Day games. The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSimilarly, Peacock will host one exclusive in-season game — a Friday night game in Brazil on the season's first weekend — after it aired an exclusive Wild Card playoff game last season. The platform, which paid a reported $110 million for the rights to the playoff game, saw a significant lift in subscribers as a result.\n\nGoogle's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) now holds the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\n\"You have to meet consumers where they are,\" Anthony Palomba, professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told Yahoo Finance. \"That is something that I think up until recently has been lost on all of the major CEOs of media companies. You can't keep doing what's familiar.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSchroeder said the shift to more digital-first, streaming partners is one that \"feels less revolutionary this year\" and \"more like the next step in the evolution.\"\n\n\"For us, it all starts with wanting wide, broad reach of our games,\" he said. \"That's why 85% [of our games] are on broadcast television. It's really a smaller part that aren't. All games are on broadcast in their home markets.\"\n\n\"But we also need to be smart. We know our fans are increasingly spending their time on other screens, other platforms, and we need to be on those platforms too.\"\n\n'A mutually beneficial relationship'\n\nAs the media landscape has changed and consumers turn away from cable bundles more and more, sports sometimes feels like the only thing left to watch on TV.\n\nAnd when it comes to sports on TV, the biggest audiences aggregate in one place: NFL football. NFL games on TV accounted for 93 of the 100 highest-rated shows on TV in 2023. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes fires up the crowd before the first half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions, Saturday, Aug. 17, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"We were a big part of the growth of broadcast TV,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter last year.\n\n\"It was a mutually beneficial relationship. We reached a much broader audience, and it helped them develop to the point where we even developed a fourth network with Fox in the early ’90s. And that wasn’t just a sports network, that was a network.\"\n\n\"Now it’s streaming, and I think a large part of that is advertising and subscription and dual revenue streams, and that’s the case here,\" he said.\n\nSome experts see the recent move to carve out one-off games — Black Friday on Amazon, Christmas on Netflix — as the beginning of a broader trend for the league.\n\n\"It's in the league's best interest to start to create more skinny bundles or smaller packages that they sell,\" Adam Paul, executive director of TV at data company LiveRamp, told Yahoo Finance. \"You're going to see more breaking down of the games or packages into smaller parcels because they can increase the fees that they ultimately get across all of their distribution.\"\n\nBut the NFL said these one-off games are more of the exception than the rule.\n\nThese games \"are a great way to go onto platforms in a smart way, [but] most of our rights, most of our packages will be more than just a couple of games,\" Schroeder said.\n\nThat being said, there's no denying the recent hype around the Olympics has reshaped what's possible in terms of how leagues (namely, the NFL) think about distributing their content.

(Christian Liewig - Corbis via Getty Images) (Christian Liewig - Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\"The one thing that is unique about the Olympics, but I think other leagues will have to pay attention to, is there's so many events and sports teams going on at once,\" Paul added. \"I could choose to tune in to any event that I wanted to watch at any time throughout the games.\"\n\n\"And so, the most basic and obvious way to think about that for the NFL is, I might live in New York, but I could be a Cowboys fan. That's what consumers want: The optionality to watch the thing I want to watch when I want to watch it.\"\n\n'Consumers are getting savvier'\n\nThe NFL isn't the only league seeing the value of its sports rights go up. Nor has it been the most creative when it comes to divvying up its schedule.\n\nThe NBA, for instance, signed a new media rights deal this year worth around $77 billion over 11 years with new partners that include Amazon and NBCUniversal. It was also able to strike a new agreement with one of its current media partners, Disney. The league did not re-sign with its other partner, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).\n\nThis new deal will see playoff games, including conference finals series in six of the deal's 11 years, air on Amazon Prime.\n\nMeanwhile, the MLB has national television contracts with broadcasters including ESPN, Fox, and TBS. Connected TV platform Roku (ROKU) recently acquired the rights to \"Sunday Leadoff,\" which broadcasts MLB games primarily held on Sunday afternoons, and Apple TV+ airs Friday night games.\n\nSome have argued all of this optionality may lead to more confusion over when, where, and how to watch. The NFL has implemented tools, like a new help center, to combat this confusion, offering fans a personalized view of how to watch games based on location.\n\nBut there's also more access to sports content today than ever before. And more games in more places is the ultimate audience motivator.\n\n\"Consumers are getting savvier,\" said Paul. \"They'll figure it out. Just the rise in streaming has made consumers smarter about how to consume the content that they want to watch.\"\n\nTo that point, TV consumption on streaming has been on a steady rise.\n\nAccording to the latest installment of the Gauge report from Nielsen, streaming hit another record in July, accounting for 41.4% of overall TV viewing. YouTube led the charge, becoming the first streaming platform to break 10% of total TV viewing time.\n\n'How can TV be more like gaming?'\n\nA push to lock in the next generation of NFL fans is central to how games are distributed, and the NFL has even played with the actual broadcasts in an effort to engage younger fans.\n\n\"Younger generations really like gaming and social media just as much, if not more, than television and movies,\" said UVA's Palomba, who specializes in entertainment and consumer behavior. \"How can gaming be more like TV? How can TV be more like gaming?\"\n\nLast year, ESPN and the NFL teamed up for a \"Toy Story Funday Football\" — a fully animated, alternative telecast between the Jaguars and Falcons. CBS also aired a \"Nickelodeon NFL Nickmas Game\" last season and aired an alternate feed of the Super Bowl that featured characters like SpongeBob SquarePants offering commentary on the game.\n\n\"We're still in the early days of figuring out the right way to bring the live game in combination with these other experiences together,\" said Schroeder. \"But the good news is that the opportunity ahead of us is so wide.\" (Courtesy: ESPN, NFL)\n\nAmazon has also leaned in to a more engaged user experience, airing QR codes and interactive banners for viewers to actively shop while watching last year's Black Friday games.\n\nESPN has also found success with the Manningcast, an alternate live TV experience of Monday Night Football hosted by former NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, and tried this format across other sports, like college football and golf.\n\n\"The gamification of NFL football enables greater engagement and satiates younger consumers' [tendencies] to eventually switch to a more interactive experience,\" Palomba said of the recent experiments.\n\n\"If you're in the business of making a profit, if you're in the business of maximizing audiences, you're always looking for different eyeballs,\" Palomba said. \"Wherever you can find them.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Alphabet grew its EPS by 15% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Alphabet shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 26% to 31%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Alphabet.\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$202b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\n\nShould You Add Alphabet To Your Watchlist?\n\nAs previously touched on, Alphabet is a growing business, which is encouraging. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Alphabet, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Alphabet is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 5, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCan AI Advancements Drive Microsoft Stock Beyond Its +8.8% YTD?\n\nThoughMicrosoft has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index's return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.\n\nMicrosoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.\n\nMSFT's AI Revolution: Driving Growth Across Sectors\n\nMicrosoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.\n\nOne of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.\n\nThe company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology — AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nThe integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.\n\nAs Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT's fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.\n\nMSFT Navigates Market Challenges and Valuation Concerns\n\nMicrosoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.\n\nThe AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet-owned Google, Amazon and Meta Platforms making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.\n\nMicrosoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.\n\nAs Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further.\n\nHowever, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Google faces a possible $100 billion litigation avalanche, says Bernstein",
        "content": "A federal judge ruled last month that Google is a monopolist, and on top of the penalties yet to come, the company may have to add a new multi-billion-dollar problem to its list of headaches.\n\nAlong with the Justice Department’s proposed remedies, which could reportedly include breaking up the business, Google could also face multiple class action lawsuits from advertisers seeking monetary penalties as payback for years of inflated charges. All told, the mounting tab for the tech giant could exceed $100 billion, on top of possible lawsuits from competitors that could bring other penalties, according to a Tuesday note by Bernstein analysts.\n\nThe antitrust suit, along with potentially billions in penalties sought in possible future lawsuits could lead Google to take a less aggressive strategic stance at a time where generative AI is revolutionizing its search business, Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Fortune.\n\n“The reality of an internet company is progress never stops. And if you're going to be hampered, where maybe you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back, it becomes a very difficult prospect to move as quickly as you'd like, and maybe as you need to,” Shmulik said.\n\nThe ruling found that Google used its dominance in text ads to charge “supra-competitive prices,” or prices above what would be sustainable in a competitive market, which allowed it to earn “monopoly profits” on text ads like those that appear near the top of search results.\n\nAlthough text ads may seem antiquated, they make up 65% of the larger search ads market, according to the ruling. In 2020, text ads made up about 80% of Google’s search ads by revenue. That same year, the company’s “Google search and other” product category brought in $104 billion in revenue, according to a filing with the SEC.\n\nThe court found that Google used this monopoly power to raise prices on its search text ads between 5% and 15% to reach its revenue targets without losing customers to competitors. The ruling also found that Google didn’t take into account what rival firms were charging for similar text ads when setting its prices.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Google spokesperson directed Fortune to a previous statement by Google’s president of global affairs, Kent Walker. He praised Google and said the $1.9 trillion company plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nAlthough not directly related to text ads, review and reservation company Yelp has already seized upon last month’s ruling to sue Google, saying that the company used its dominance in search to unfairly box out competitors in the market for “local search services and for local search advertising.” A Google spokesperson said “Yelp’s claims are not new.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Similar claims were thrown out years ago by the FTC (Federal Trade Commission), and recently by the judge in the DOJ’s (Department of Justice’s) case. On the other aspects of the decision to which Yelp refers, we are appealing. Google will vigorously defend against Yelp’s meritless claims,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement sent to multiple outlets.\n\nShmulik said Yelp’s lawsuit is one of the first to emerge after the ruling, and it's possible other competitors in search could have standing to sue thanks to the ruling. That includes Microsoft, the creator of rival search engine Bing, which has spent over $100 billion on search over the past 20 years, CEO Satya Nadella said during the antitrust case against Google, according to the ruling.\n\n“[Microsoft] can argue that, ‘Well part of the reason [Bing] never broke through was because of all these illegal behaviors Google engaged in, and so we want ROI on all of that investment,’” he said.\n\nMore than two decades ago, Microsoft faced its own antitrust reckoning and a subsequent surge of lawsuits could be an example of what’s to come for Google, according to Bernstein analysts. After a federal judge ruled against the tech giant in 2000, buyers of Microsoft’s PC operating system and other software products sued the company to try to claw back overcharges, mostly over a two-and-a-half year window, Shmulik said.\n\nMicrosoft settled those suits, along with several others from competitors that saw it pay out $1.9 billion to Sun Microsystems, $775 million to IBM, $536 million to Novell, and another $150 million to Gateway.\n\nAll in all, Microsoft paid around $10 billion in settlements, or about 11% of its net income, between 2002 and 2008, the Bernstein analysts found.\n\nAll signs point to potentially years of lawsuits capitalizing on the judge’s antitrust ruling against Google, said Shmulik.\n\n“Far be it from me to judge how excited lawyers sound,” he said. “But the ones I’ve talked to sounded very eager for the work.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Dell Technologies (DELL) founder and CEO Michael Dell thinks talk of an AI spending letdown is way overblown.\n\n\"There always are bumps in the road as you launch a rocket and create new capabilities. You have new product cycles. You have new introductions of things. And some customers want the existing one faster. Some want to wait for the new one. We have all the above,\" Dell told Yahoo Finance at the Citi TMT conference in New York City on Wednesday.\n\n\"But the macro picture here is very, very clear, and that is that there's enormous demand. It's growing. It's expanding out from the hyperscalers to the service providers to enterprise to commercial to sovereign AI to embedded AI to the edge to retail to manufacturing to your PC to here, there, and everywhere,\" he added.\n\nDell's second quarter underscored why the tech titan's stock has gained an impressive 45% year to date, in part as it's seen as a key player in the build-out of America's AI infrastructure.\n\nThe company said it secured $3.1 billion of AI server sales in the quarter, almost double the $1.7 billion netted in the preceding quarter.\n\nSales in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) surged 38% to $11.65 billion. AI sales are captured in the ISG segment.\n\nDell's Client Solutions Group — which includes sales of PCs and laptops — saw sales drop 4% to $12.41 billion. Consumer sales declined 22% to $1.86 billion, while the commercial business was flat at $10.6 billion.\n\n\"What organizations are seeing is this is a historic opportunity to make their businesses way more productive and efficient, while at the same time, kind of reimagining them given all this capability,\" Dell, who first started the company in 1984, said.\n\nBy and large, the Street remains bullish on Dell's stock due to its AI exposure and because it looks too cheap to ignore.\n\n\"Combining the revenue opportunity [for AI] over the medium-term — which increases visibility into double-digit revenue growth for the core business, and the continued focus on operating expenses, we see a robust earnings growth trajectory [for Dell] which is not fully appreciated in the 13x P/E multiple the shares are trading at currently,\" said JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a client note.\n\nChatterjee reiterated an Overweight rating on Dell shares, the equivalent of a Buy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.09%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.3%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the company had lost 1.2% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.63% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.64% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.83, up 18.06% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $72.79 billion, showing a 13.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $7.63 per share and a revenue of $292.25 billion, indicating changes of +31.55% and +13.93%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988.

This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 26.17.\n\nIt is also worth noting that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): An AI Stock That Broke The Internet This Week",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\n\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug​.\n\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon’s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company’s total sales​. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure​. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Recent reports suggest that the company will soon roll out the people-generating feature of its AI assistant, Gemini. This feature was temporarily paused earlier this year due to concerns about racial handling. The update is significant as it will introduce a capability not yet offered by Google's competitors, available to users subscribed to paid Gemini plans, including Gemini Advanced, Business, or Enterprise. Google has also updated the image-generating model within Gemini for this launch.\n\nIn another notable development, Reuters recently reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning to construct a large data center in Vietnam. Data centers are critical to the ongoing AI revolution in the tech industry. To date, no hyper-scaler has announced plans to build a data center outside the US. According to Reuters, internal discussions are underway, and the facility could be operational by 2027.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple’s iPhone 16 launch is a big test for consumer AI",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) will host its annual iPhone launch event on Monday, Sept. 9, at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.\n\nCEO Tim Cook is expected to headline the keynote, which will reportedly include the debut of the iPhone 16 lineup, the 10th anniversary edition of the Apple Watch, and updated AirPods.\n\nThat’s a lot of hardware, but Wall Street isn’t banking on new iPhones or special edition Apple Watches to move the company’s stock price. Instead, all eyes will be on Apple’s generative AI-powered Apple Intelligence platform.\n\nApple Intelligence is the company’s big swing at bringing generative AI capabilities to consumers’ iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Wall Street wasn’t very keen on how long it took Apple to announce its AI initiative, waiting impatiently as Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted their own AI services for enterprises and consumers.\n\nBut investors changed their tune when Apple showed off Apple Intelligence at its WWDC developer conference in June, sending the company’s stock price up around 15% and putting it ahead of Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Google for year-to-date performance. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC) in Cupertino, Calif., on June 10, 2024. (NIC COURY/AFP via Getty Images) (NIC COURY via Getty Images)\n\nApple is setting up Apple Intelligence as one of the main selling points for its latest phones, as its software will only run on last year’s iPhone 15 Pro or newer phones. And analysts are banking on that exclusivity to reinvigorate iPhone sales.\n\n“Apple Intelligence remains the key to unlocking pent-up iPhone demand and accelerating replacement cycle, and we expect Apple's… event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in an investor note.\n\nBut Apple Intelligence could prove to be something more important than a catalyst for iPhone sales. It will also serve as a make-or-break moment for generative AI in the eyes of everyday consumers.\n\nApple’s AI opportunity\n\nTake one look at Apple’s invitation for its Sept. 9 show, and it’s clear the company is going all in on AI. From the “It’s Glowtime” tagline to the multicolor Apple logo meant to evoke Siri’s revamped look, the company is sending the message that this show will be an AI showcase.\n\nApple is pouring AI into its software products with features that summarize text message threads, surface priority emails in the Mail app, provide an improved Siri experience, and enable access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nApple is also including AI staples like writing tools to help gussy up your emails and documents by proofreading your text or reworking it to sound more professional or concise. The company is also expecting developers to jump on board the AI train, building out new apps that take advantage of the technology through Apple’s devices.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We estimate this could result in incremental Services high margin growth annually of $10 billion for Apple as this all kicks in and will be the start of a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream that is both hardware and software driven,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an investor note.\n\n“We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front,” Ives added. And with that, a $30 to $40 per share bump — pushing the company’s market cap to the $4 trillion mark.\n\nApple isn’t the only company to bring generative AI to its smartphone line. Samsung has Galaxy AI software, combining its own AI with some of Google’s AI smarts. Google also offers its own Gemini AI platform via its new Pixel 9 line of devices, including its Pixel 9 Pro Fold foldable phone.\n\nApple, however, has done a far better job explaining its AI offerings than either of its competitors. It made the software seem like a must-have for users during its June developer conference, explaining how it integrates across the company’s various apps and services in a way that Samsung and Google haven’t been able to by making AI seem more personal.\n\nThe AI risk\n\nBut Apple is going to have to do more than that to get people excited about its AI efforts. I’ve been using Apple’s beta software on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and while I appreciate its ability to summarize long text message threads between friends — no one likes having to sift through 40 messages to find out what they’re doing for dinner — and find the priority email feature in Mail helpful, it’s difficult to say whether that will be enough to spark consumer interest in the technology.\n\nApple will also need to take great care to ensure that its Apple Intelligence is accurate and not prone to the kinds of hallucinations that have led to criticisms of AI software like Google’s AI Overview, which famously told people to add glue to their pizza and to eat rocks.\n\nAbove all, Apple will need to ensure that Apple Intelligence is something that consumers actually want to use and not a feature the company had to shoehorn into its portfolio to placate investors fearing Apple would miss the boat on the next tech hype train.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators will seek feedback next week on Google's proposals to comply with tech rules aimed at promoting fair competition, people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, which could decide whether it faces formal charges.\n\nThe European Commission launched an investigation in March into Google to see if it favours its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.\n\nThe move came after rivals, which include comparison shopping sites, said Alphabet's Google had not complied fully with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aimed at reining in the power of Big Tech and to create a level playing field for smaller competitors.\n\nGoogle's latest proposals aim to create a separate box for rivals below its own product listing ads box in Google search results to address criticism from comparison shopping sites, the people said.\n\nThe company also offered to create two different boxes next to each other, with one showing intermediaries and the other for direct suppliers such as airlines, hotels and retailers, they said.\n\nThe Commission will hold workshops separately for these groups from Sept. 9 to 11 to get their views on the proposals, the people said. Google has not been invited to the events.\n\nThe EU competition watchdog did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle said: \"We have engaged with the European Commission and industry stakeholders over the past year, receiving and responding to feedback in an effort to balance a wide spectrum of views across the ecosystem. We will continue to engage over the coming months.\"\n\nFailure to allay the regulatory concerns could result in formal charges against Google by the end of September that could lead to a hefty fine as much as 10% of its global annual turnover, the people said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Have $20,000? These AI Stocks Could Be Bargain Buys for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) last year led to a rally in the tech market. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has climbed 81% since the start of 2023, driven primarily by excitement over AI. While the bull run has benefited current investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones, as the stocks of many of the world's leading tech giants are trading at a premium.\n\nIt can be difficult to figure out when a stock is a good buy, but investors can start by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and comparing it to the P/E of competitors. The ratio is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share, and lower is considered better.\n\nAI superstar Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) P/E sits at 56. With Advanced Micro Devices' P/E at 181 and Intel's at 96, Nvidia looks like a bargain. Meanwhile, Nvidia keeps succeeding with its majority market share in AI chips, and its stock looks like a no-brainer way to invest in AI right now.\n\nAnd Nvidia isn't the only compelling option. So, have $20,000 that you don't need for anything in the short or medium term? Here are two AI stocks that look like bargain buys in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia ($108 per share)\n\nAccording to research group BIS research, the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market saw spending of about $15 billion last year and will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 32% until at least 2028 -- hitting $62 billion. GPUs are a crucial growth area in AI, with the chips necessary for training and running AI models. Meanwhile, fierce competition between various AI software giants means companies will require the latest and most powerful chips to keep up with their rivals, creating instant demand for newly released GPUs.\n\nNvidia has enjoyed this demand firsthand, with an estimated 90% market share in AI GPUs.\n\nThe company posted its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 28. Revenue increased 122% year over year, beating Wall Street expectations by just over $1 billion. Meanwhile, earnings per share came in $0.04 higher than analysts had forecast. The quarter benefited from consistent growth in AI GPU sales, with revenue in its data center segment popping 154%.\n\nFurthermore, the chart below shows that Nvidia's earnings could reach nearly $5.00 per share in two fiscal years. If the stock's P/E stays near where it is, that would mean a much higher stock price in two years. NVDA EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\n2. Alphabet ($158 per share)\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has delivered impressive gains over the years, with its stock up 178% since 2019. Alphabet's operating income and free cash flow have climbed 135% and 96% over the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nPopular services like YouTube, Google, Android, and Chrome have made Alphabet an invaluable resource to consumers and businesses worldwide. These platforms attract billions of users daily, providing the company with a lucrative tool for building a highly profitable digital advertising business. And now, the company has a similar opportunity in AI.\n\nAdvertising has spurred the company's growth in recent years; in the most recent quarter, advertising accounted for nearly 80% of Alphabet's revenue. The tech giant's investment in AI is also promising as it employs an expansion strategy similar to what it used to succeed in advertising. Over the last year, the company has integrated AI into many of its services, using the technology, for example, to better track viewing trends on YouTube and recommend videos, create a more responsive Google Search, and add a range of generative AI features to Android.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet has even ventured into AI hardware with its recently revealed Google Pixel 9 smartphone, likely to give Apple's coming iPhone 16 a run for its money with its advanced generative features.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, Alphabet stock is a bargain compared to its rivals when viewed on a P/E basis. The company's P/E of 23 is a low on this list. An investment in Alphabet could offer big gains over the long term.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer shares tumble on Barclays downgrade",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) were down on Wednesday following a downgrade from Barclays.\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares were down 3% in pre-market trading at 8:18 am (1214 GMT)\n\nBarclays’ analysts have raised concerns about SMCI’s future prospects, prompting a downgrade to an equal weight rating and a revised price target of $438. This is mainly due to the company's declining gross margins, persistent customer losses, and issues with internal controls.\n\nOne of the key factors behind the downgrade is SMCI's recent performance in terms of gross margins. In the June quarter, the company’s overall gross margin fell significantly to 11.3%, marking a 430 basis point decline from the previous quarter.\n\nThe gross margin for AI servers was reported to be in the high single digits, while Dedicated Liquid Cooling (DLC) server margins were even lower.\n\n“MCI has been giving away DLC components for free to match or price below the air-cooled rack pricing provided by Dell (NYSE:DELL),” said analysts at Barclays.\n\nThe pricing strategy, combined with supply chain constraints, has pressured margins, leading to concerns about potential P/E multiple compression and diminished investor confidence.\n\n“SMCI has been ceding shares in its top two customers: Musk entities and Coreweave (private, not covered, except for TSLA),” the analysts said.\n\nPreviously, SMCI had an exclusive supplier relationship with Musk Inc., but recent developments have seen the business split evenly between SMCI and Dell.\n\nThis shift has resulted in a drop in SMCI’s market share, to around 50% by June 2024 from 100% in 2023. Coreweave, another major customer, has also reduced its reliance on SMCI, a trend analysts attribute to improved GPU supply and Dell’s strengthened competitive position.\n\nAdding to these challenges is the uncertainty surrounding the new GB200 server platform. Barclays’ analysts worry that SMCI might hold a smaller market share in GB200 servers compared to its position with Hopper-based servers.\n\nThe expected lower margins for GB200 servers could further pressure SMCI’s profitability. Additionally, the absence of definitive customer orders for the GB200 platform exacerbates the uncertainty, especially as competition heats up and margins could potentially shrink.\n\nAnother concern for Barclays is SMCI’s internal controls and corporate governance. The delay in filing the 10-K report has raised red flags, highlighting issues related to transparency and governance. SMCI's lack of detailed financial disclosures, including quarterly order intake and backlog, has been a point of contention.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s past history with regulatory issues and its previous delisting from Nasdaq have only intensified these concerns.\n\nIn light of these factors, Barclays has adjusted its price target for SMCI to $438, using a valuation multiple of 12x FY25E EPS of $36.48. This new target aligns more closely with Dell’s valuation multiple, reflecting a more cautious stance given the current margin trends and internal issues.\n\nWhile Barclays remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the AI sector, it has identified Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) as a preferred alternative investment. Flex's increasing involvement in switch tray and power components for GB200 systems, along with its gains in Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) TPU server assembly, makes it a more attractive option in the current environment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares tumble on Barclays downgrade\n\nMint Incorporation Ltd Files for 1.75M Share IPO at $4-$5/sh\n\nExclusive-OpenAI co-founder Sutskever's new safety-focused AI startup SSI raises $1 billion\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares in chip company Nvidia plunged on Tuesday, ending the session nearly 10% lower, amid renewed concerns around economic growth in the US.\n\nFigures from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed that a measure of US manufacturing ticked higher last month but the metric reflected slowing factory activity, as the reading came in below a threshold that suggests a contraction in the sector. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday's non-farm payrolls report.\n\nUS markets tumbled, with Nvidia and other chipmakers leading other tech stocks lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 2.1% in previous session, the Nasdaq (^IXIC) declined 3.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down 1.5%.

This comes after the US Department of Justice sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant provider of AI chips.\n\nSwetha Ramachandran, fund manager at Artemis Investment Management, said the fund manager views Nvidia's fall as \"a recalibration of its near-term prospects than a reflection of structural concerns — the company continues to grow its share of the AI chip market and to innovate in this area.\"\n\nBarratt Developments (BDEV.L)\n\nHousebuilder Barratt Developments dipped 2% on Wednesday morning, after the company reported that its profit before tax for the year ended 30 June 2024 was 75% lower than the previous year, at £170.5m ($223.7m).\n\nBarratt also posted revenues 22% lower than in 2023, at £4.17bn, though this was in line with expectations, said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nThe housebuilder halved its dividend to 16.2p per ordinary share, down from 33.7p in 2023.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nHunter said: “There is an element of kitchen-sinking to these numbers as Barratt has revealed the true extent of a difficult year.\"\n\nHunter said there were some signs of an improving economic backdrop and that its acquisition of Redrow could be \"transformative if the element of integration risk over the next couple of years is successfully navigated.\"\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nShares of Alphabet fell almost 4% on Tuesday, after Morgan Stanley lowered its price target on the tech firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank cut its target on Alphabet to $190 from $205, citing ongoing legal challenges with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) related to accusations of antitrust violations and monopolistic practices.\n\nAlphabet lost a key antitrust case earlier in August, in which a court ruled ruled that Google monopolises online search.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said that the regulatory issues could take several years to resolve, potentially impacting the company's long-term outlook.\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nPlane manufacturer Boeing fell 7% in the previous session, after the company was downgraded by Wells Fargo, as it warned that shares could fall nearly 30%.\n\nBoeing is facing fresh labour challenges, as reports say that 32,000 workers could begin a strike this month if the business and union are unable to reach a deal.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers cut the price target on the stock to $119, according to Bloomberg. Akers said that he expected Boeing's free cash flow per share to peak by 2027.\n\nAkers also highlighted softening demand, as well as technical issues that needed to be dealt with on Boeing's 777X jetliner and Starliner spacecraft.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "US antitrust trial targets Google's digital ad business",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google faces trial in a second antitrust case next week where the U.S. Department of Justice will challenge how the search giant monetizes advertising through a system that prosecutors say harms news publishers.\n\nThe case is part of the Biden administration's effort to rein in Big Tech through antitrust law, and follows a major win for the Justice Department in a separate lawsuit on Aug. 5 when a judge found that Google illegally monopolized online search.\n\nWhile that case focused on Google's ubiquitous search engine, the trial beginning in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday will home in on less conspicuous Google technology that connects website publishers and advertisers.\n\nThose advertising tools contributed to the more than 75% of Google's $307.4 billion in revenue last year that came from advertising.\n\n\"Google is far and away the largest seller of advertising on earth. They touch every part of the industry, if not directly, then indirectly. Everyone has an interest in Google one way or another,\" said Brian Wieser, an advertising consultant and financial analyst.\n\nThe Justice Department and a coalition of states will seek to show Google broke U.S. antitrust law in its digital advertising businesses. A victory for the states and Justice Department would set the stage for them to ask U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema to order a breakup of the company.\n\nThe antitrust regulators accuse Google of dominating the markets for the technology behind website ads by tying its tools for publishers and advertisers together, staking out a \"privileged position as the middleman.\"\n\nGoogle has denied the claims, saying it is not required to share technological advantages with rivals and that its products are interoperable with those offered by competitors.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Google controls 91% of the market for ad servers, where publishers offer ad space, more than 85% of the market for ad networks, which advertisers use to place ads, and over half of the market for ad exchanges.\n\nGoogle says its share of those markets is 30% or less when including advertising on social media, streaming TV and apps, and says the Justice Department's narrow focus on website ads obscures the fierce competition it faces as those categories grow.\n\nGoogle competitors on the advertiser side, such as Trade Desk and Comcast, and publisher side, such as PubMatic, are on the list of potential witnesses.\n\nThe case will also highlight how advertising technology has affected news organizations. One-third of newspapers in the U.S. have been closed or sold since 2005, according to a Northwestern University study published last November.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Journalism is under threat in large part due to consolidation in the advertising market,\" Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said at an event held in June by the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly advocacy group.\n\nCurrent or former executives from News Corp, the Daily Mail and Gannett, which has also sued Google, may testify at trial.\n\nGoogle has focused on small businesses and publishers, some of whom it plans to call as witnesses at trial. A breakup would \"slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder\" for small companies to grow, Google has said.\n\nThe way Google viewed its ad tech will be a key focus at trial, with potential testimony from more than two dozen current or former employees and executives, including YouTube Chief Executive Neal Mohan, a former Google advertising executive.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Kamala Harris will announce a new policy proposal Wednesday for a $50,000 tax credit for small businesses looking to get off the ground.\n\nAt the center of her new plan is the small business tax deduction currently in the tax code that allows would-be entrepreneurs to deduct up to $5,000 for things like business start-up costs.\n\nThe proposal from Harris would increase that tenfold — and will be formally announced on Wednesday with the vice president set to further outline her economic ideas during a stop in Portsmouth, N.H.\n\nShe will also unveil an overall goal of triggering 25 million new small business applications over the next four years.\n\nHarris is also set to propose additional measures Wednesday around things like reducing red tape for small businesses. Tomorrow's rollout also comes ahead of next week's highly anticipated debate with former President Donald Trump where economic worries are likely to be top of mind. Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event in Pittsburgh with President Joe Biden on Labor Day. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n\"One of my singular priorities is to invest and grow our small businesses,\" Harris said at a campaign stop last week.\n\nThe latest rollout from the Harris campaign is a clear effort to appeal to business-minded voters. She is attempting to ally herself with smaller businesses while sometimes assailing bigger ones.\n\n\"We will continue to build what I call an opportunity economy so that every American has an opportunity to buy a home or start a business or build intergenerational wealth and have a future that matches their dreams and ambitions and aspirations,\" Harris added Monday during a Labor Day stop in Pittsburgh.\n\nA potential for widespread appeal\n\nFor his part, Donald Trump often points to his own business record as president as a reason for voters to choose him. He also charges that a potential Harris administration would be cataclysmic for small businesses and has even taken to calling her \"Comrade Kamala\" in recent weeks.\n\nBut the Harris/Walz campaign has sought to combat the charges with what is now a second economic policy plan that follows last month's release of a cost of living plan aimed at housing and grocery store prices as well as an expansion of the child tax credit.\n\nBut this week's focus on small businesses and entrepreneurs could have appeal for millions of potential voters.\n\nSmall business entrepreneurship has been on the rise in recent years, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. It found that in 2022 almost 20% of US adults were in the process of founding a business or had done so in the past 3.5 years. It was the highest reading since the survey began back in 1999.\n\nStory continues Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa., on Aug. 30. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nThe Biden White House has often touted increasing small business activity since the pandemic ended, pointing to some 19 million new small business applications during his term so far.\n\nHarris is aiming to take it further, but other measures of entrepreneurship are coming in more mixed. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index recently rose in July to 93.7 but remains below the 50-year average of 98.\n\nThis week's Harris/Walz proposal, meanwhile, is also set to include new rules they say will make it easier to start a business. The ideas to be unveiled include ways to claim this new deduction to maximize the tax impact. Also in the works are plans for reducing some of the paperwork needed for things like small business licenses.\n\nA focus on small over big businesses\n\nThis week's Harris plan could also be a selling point among crucial donors, especially parts of Silicon Valley focused on \"little tech\" startups as opposed to giant companies like Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), which have gradually lost public support in recent years amid increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators in Washington.\n\nLikewise, Harris has sought in recent weeks to position herself as a friend of small businesses and a foe, of sorts, to those bigger corporations.\n\nLast month's prices plan focused on Democratic charges that grocery store owners and corporate landlords are \"price gouging\" their customers. Harris has detailed plans to crack down on their practices.\n\nAlso this week, the Harris campaign released a new campaign ad focused on economic issues and drawing a contrast between the Harris and Trump economic plans. A keen focus for Harris is Trump's friendly relationship with corporations and his focus, as the ad's narrator said, \"on giving them tax cuts.\"\n\nTrump has often discussed lowering the federal corporate tax rate from its current level of 21% to 15%-20%. Harris is behind a plan to raise that rate to 28%.\n\nMeanwhile, there is at least one large corporation that Harris is trying to be friendly with: McDonald's (MCD). Harris often notes that she worked at the chain during a summer in college. Both she and Trump are looking to be associated with the brand, which the company says is patronized by nearly 9 in 10 Americans at least once a year.\n\nAlso potentially in the offing in the weeks ahead is a Kamala Harris plan for the \"care economy\" around issues like childcare and paid family leave. These have long been priorities for the vice president, with her campaign signaling that plans there could also be in the offing soon.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Fantastic Stocks That Could Join The S&amp;P 500 by 2025",
        "content": "Ever wondered why some stocks are in the S&P 500 and others aren't? Well, it turns outthere'sa very specific set of criteria that must be met for a stock to gain entry into the index, which will be revealed below.\n\nBut now, three Fool.com contributors will name their top stocks that could be added to the index by 2025. Let's dive right in. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir meets all the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500\n\nJake Lerch (Palantir Technologies): My choice as a stock that could join the S&P 500 by next year is PalantirTechnologies(NYSE: PLTR). Palantir is the maker of an AI-powered platform that helps organizations understand complex datasets, and the company's stock is red-hot.\n\nSo far this year, Palantir stock is up a remarkable 80%. Its market cap is now $68 billion, making the AI stock America's 279th-largest public company by market cap. Yet, as of this writing, Palantir is still not a member of the S&P 500.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nIt's a good question because Palantir checks all of the boxes needed for inclusion in the S&P 500:\n\nA U.S. Company Market cap of at least $18 billion Stock is highly liquid Public float is at least 50% of total shares outstanding Positive earnings in its most recent quarter and total positive earnings in the four most recent quarters\n\nFirst off, Palantir is based in the U.S. and has a market cap of nearly $70 billion -- check.\n\nSecond, Palantir's stock is highly liquid; its public float is well over 50% of its outstanding shares available.\n\nFinally, we come to profitability. Profitability, in all likelihood, is why Palantir is not in the S&P 500. While the company has reported positive earnings in each of the last six quarters, they have been tiny profits. PLTR EPS Diluted (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs you can see above, Palantir had quarterly losses as recently as late 2022. Because of that, the committee has likely delayed putting Palantir into the S&P 500 -- waiting to see more quarters of positive earnings before giving Palantir the nod.\n\nHowever, one more quarter of positive earnings might be enough to lead to the committee adding Palantir to the index by 2025. And that's exactly what I think will happen.\n\nS&P 500 inclusion might help make this company the next great advertising stock\n\nWill Healy(The Trade Desk): Mega-cap tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have built their fortunes on digital advertising. These companies generate tens of billions in revenue every quarter by helping businesses of all sizes reach desired audiences, and that market power makes them mainstays of the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid the influence of this industry, the next advertising stock to enter the S&P 500 might just be The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD). Its demand-side platform allows agencies and companies to manage digital ad campaigns, running ads in the times and places where they believe they can generate the highest returns. Additionally, with the help of AI tool Kokai, users can further refine the timing and placement of ads to derive more value.\n\nThanks to its capabilities, it has become a stock with a $50 billion market cap, far above the minimum market cap required to enter the S&P 500. From that point, its financials will likely help boost this stock further.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2024 was just under $1.1 billion, a 27% increase compared with the same period last year. The company has also recovered from an earnings slump it faced in 2022. With that, its net income was $117 million in the first six months of 2024, rising 176% compared with year-ago levels.\n\nAmid these fast-rising profits, its 205 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is likely not representative of its valuation, but its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 24 admittedly makes it expensive. Still, analysts forecast 26% revenue growth this year and 20% in 2025, meaning revenues will continue to place downward pressure on its sales multiple.\n\nFinally, investors should remember what inclusion in the index means -- a place in the portfolio of every investor who invests in the S&P 500 through index funds. That rising influence should further bolster the stock as more advertisers turn to its platform.\n\nCoinbase would give the S&P 500 exposure to cryptocurrency's potential upside.\n\nJustin Pope (Coinbase): If the S&P 500 is going to look to innovation and add AI tech companies such as CrowdStrike and Super Micro Computer into the index, it makes perfect sense to add Coinbase(NASDAQ: COIN), too. Cryptocurrencies are still hotly debated among investors, but the asset class is forcing its way into the conversation. According to research by The Motley Fool, approximately one-quarter of investors are \"very likely\" to buy at least some form of cryptocurrency.\n\nThe case for Coinbase is simple. It's a publicly traded U.S. company, making it arguably the safest exchange and crypto-finance company after fraud and controversy have tainted or destroyed private and foreign competitors like Binance and FTX.\n\nNext, it easily meets the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500; its current $42 billion market cap meets the minimum threshold. Plus, it is comfortably GAAP profitable, with almost $1.4 billion in net income over the past four quarters.\n\nMost importantly, it's a fantastic business. Coinbase's exchange is its core business, but its ambitions span the crypto economy, including financial products such as banking and payment cards that allow users to spend their crypto as dollars. Cryptocurrency can be cyclical, but Coinbase has proven it can endure the downturns. The company is also in a great financial position, with over $8 billion in cash on its balance sheet, nearly a fifth of the stock's value.\n\nCryptocurrencies must continue to gain adoption among society and investors for Coinbase's business to grow over the long term. However, there isn't a better stock for exposure to crypto's potential upside. Adding Coinbase to the S&P 500 would reflect a forward-thinking investment strategy and help lift the index higher over the coming years if cryptocurrency continues gaining steam.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Consumers benefit from Google’s dominance in search, Google-backed trade group says",
        "content": "Antitrust cases do not often capture everyday Americans’ attention, but the recent case the government hatched against Google deserves more attention than it has received. The consequences of the ruling will have long-lasting effects, far beyond the realm of Big Tech, and American consumers will lose out.\n\nGoogle’s recent loss in the biggest antitrust legal battle in more than 20 years is a blow to Silicon Valley. Despite accusations of anticompetitive practices, Google really lost because it excels at what it does—being the global leader in online search.\n\nAmerica’s 30th president Calvin Coolidge once remarked that the “chief business of the American people is business,” and Americans are “profoundly concerned with producing, buying, selling, investing and prospering the world.” We have built a culture that is committed to innovating. Our best inventions and companies are household names around the entire globe. Google is among those American products and companies that are known and used by people all around the world.\n\nAs is widely known, Google was started in a humble garage in California in 1998 by Stanford University Ph.D. candidates Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They had a vision then that has guided the company over the past 26 years—a passion “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”\n\nIn short? They set out to make the world’s greatest Internet search functionality. And, to a remarkable degree, that’s exactly what they accomplished.\n\nIn fact, Google’s dominance in the field was even recognized by the presiding judge during the trial. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta commented that Google has built “the industry’s highest quality search engine.” That sounds like a ringing endorsement, not a reason to level antitrust charges against Google. Even Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella admitted in his testimony that Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, is inferior to Google.\n\nThe case, brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, rests on a novel antitrust theory. Rather than determining if consumers have been harmed by anticompetitive practices, the Justice Department is claiming that Google’s dominance in the market is proof of its anticompetitive practices. How else, the case argues, could a company hold 90% of the market?\n\nJudge Mehta sided with the government in ruling against Google and Apple. The two companies had a product placement deal to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone. Apple, it is worth noting, was paid $20 billion for this arrangement, but, as a company that is also determined to deliver the best value to its customers, this arrangement represented two companies putting the best product forward. Apple executives testified that \"there's no price that Microsoft could ever offer\" to make Bing the default search engine on their devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers who purchased iPhones were not prohibited or restricted in any way from downloading Bing or any other search product as their default.\n\nGoogle is sought out by consumers because it works reliably and quickly, and there is no other company that delivers a product anywhere close to Google’s search. In the European Union, when competitors complained about Google, regulators required that a “choice screen” be put onto all new phones. The result? Consumers had to take an extra step to make Google their choice. But Google remained the default on the vast majority of phones.\n\nLost on the judge and on the Justice Department is this simple fact: Google dominates in this marketplace because the product dominates as consumers’ top choice.\n\nIn business, and especially in the tech industry, unpredictability is the defining feature. The ever-changing landscape means companies thrive when they anticipate where the market is heading.\n\nGoogle’s founders set out to make the Internet more user-friendly because they knew that was where the market was heading. People would want faster, better, more efficient, and more customized search results. And the reason people continue to choose Google for their online searches is that the company today remains obsessive about delivering the best search results.\n\nThe traditional consumer welfare standard in antitrust was jettisoned in this lawsuit against Google. Consumers, far from being hurt by Google’s practices, have benefited for two decades.\n\nAs Judge Mehta noted during the trial, “The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public.” He was right. The importance of this ruling, if it is allowed to stand on appeal, will have a negative effect on future companies that innovate and dominate in the market because they deliver exactly what their customers want.\n\nGoogle’s 90% share of the market is not the result of alleged anticompetitive behavior or efforts to block would-be competitors. Google reigns as the leader in search because the competition offers an inferior search experience.\n\nThere’s a reason why the top search query on Bing is “Google.”\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nAn economic catastrophe is lurking beneath Russia’s GDP growth as Putin ‘throws everything into the fireplace’ The ‘sustainability recession’ will end soon—and not by choice ‘Godmother of AI’ says California’s well-intended AI bill will harm the U.S. ecosystem Clichés, exaggerations, overstatements: Our analysis of 23,000 annual reviews shows top performers get the worst feedback\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the U.S. large cap was once again the place to be. The fund increased 5.7% (Institutional Shares) in the second quarter compared to an 8.3% gain for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and a 4.3% increase for the S&P 500 Index. Year to date, the fund returned 19.1% compared to 20.7% and 15.3% gains for the indexes. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 2.78%, and its shares gained 20.69% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 30, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $165.11 per share with a market capitalization of $2.021 trillion.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the second quarter which was 165 in the previous quarter. In the first quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) generated $80.5 billion in revenues, up 15% year-over-year (see the details here). While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\n\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\n\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\n\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\n\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data—not too hot, not too cold—that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\n\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on  “historical trends” and the “market landscape” from various sectors which have “substantial” potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n\nIn a recent legal development, a judge ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its monopoly in the market, particularly through an exclusive deal with Apple. However, some argue that this ruling is outdated and fails to consider the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in search technology.\n\nThe possibility of a Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) breakup has sparked discussions about its impact on the company's stock and overall structure. Gene Munster, a tech analyst, believes that if an announcement were made about breaking up Google, the stock could potentially rise by 5% or more, unlocking up to 20% of its value. However, he also estimates the likelihood of such a breakup at around 15%.\n\nDan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities suggests that the current antitrust challenges will likely result in business model adjustments rather than full-scale breakups. While these issues are more than just minor inconveniences, they are not expected to significantly disrupt the core operations or profitability of these tech giants. Interestingly, Ives notes that if companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google were to be broken up, the sum of their individual parts might actually be worth more than their current stock prices—a paradox in the ongoing antitrust debate.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) experienced significant growth in Q2 2024, with a 15% year-over-year revenue increase and a 31% rise in diluted EPS. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew nearly 29% YoY, strengthening its position in the cloud market. Despite a recent 14% drop in its stock price, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is valued at 20-25x FY2024 earnings, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, projecting a 25.03% upside as of August 16. Although regulatory challenges and AI competition pose risks, Alphabet’s strong data capabilities and innovation provide resilience.\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: Alphabet Will Be the Robotaxi Leader, Not Tesla",
        "content": "The robotaxi wars are heating up. After an initial delay, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has a planned robotaxi event in October, while General Motors' (NYSE: GM) Cruise recently struck a deal with Uber to offer autonomous vehicles on the ride-sharing company's platform next year.\n\nHowever, there is currently one company ahead of the pack and that is Waymo, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Let's take a look at why I think Alphabet will be the robotaxi leader moving forward.\n\nFirst-mover advantage\n\nAt this point, Waymo is way ahead of the pack, with customers actually using its robotaxi services. The company recently announced that it is providing 100,000 paid robotaxi trips a week, which is about 100,000 more than Tesla and Cruise combined are currently offering.\n\nThis is double the number of trips Waymo was providing in May. Currently, the company is operating in four U.S. cities: San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. It plans to expand into other cities within the corresponding states. At present, only California, Texas, and Arizona permit autonomous-taxi services.\n\nWaymo also recently unveiled its sixth-generation, self-driving technology, which will look to reduce the costs of the vehicles. The new technology will lower the number of cameras around the vehicles from 29 to 13 and the number of lidar sensors from five to four. Waymo is currently testing the new-generation technology on public roads with professional drivers on board. In addition to cost savings, the new technology has also been designed to handle more weather conditions.\n\nWith Waymo the only robotaxi service currently operating in the U.S., the company has a nice first-mover advantage. Customers are already using its fleet without major incident, which will only build confidence in its offering as it expands. Meanwhile, driving down costs with its vehicles is also important, as this will make the economics for the service better.\n\nEarlier this year, Alphabet announced that it would invest another $5 billion into Waymo to help the company continue to ramp up its business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTesla has history of overpromising and underdelivering\n\nWhile Tesla has a big robotaxi event planned for October, thus far, the company has not delivered any paid rides to customers. And yet, for years Tesla has been telling everyone it would turn customer vehicles into fully autonomous cars with a software update.\n\nIn 2016, the company famously wrote a blog post that all its cars were now produced with self-driving hardware. However, seven years have passed, and none of Tesla's driving systems are fully autonomous; they all need to be supervised with a driver. Meanwhile, the older hardware has needed upgrading to run its latest \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD) service at the cost of the customer, which has led to lawsuits.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd in December 2023, Tesla had to recall more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had to investigate the recall after 20 reported crashes followed the installation of the updated software. Over the last few years, there have been about 1,000 auto accidents reported involving Tesla's Auto Pilot system.\n\nCritics of Tesla's robotaxi efforts abound. In July, Rolling Stone questioned if Tesla even has the technology to build a robotaxi, citing a number of critics of the company. The publication followed that up in August with a test drive using the company's self-driving technology. The author of the Rolling Stone article said they did not feel safe and that the technology almost caused an accident.\n\nRolling Stone, though, isn't the only news source to question Tesla's autonomous-driving technology; InsideEVs reported that in a test drive, bad weather compromised the vehicle's FSD system. It noted that the car dangerously stopped in the middle of a highway to let a car pass, and also tried to turn off the road and into a furniture store. It said that a lack of supplemental radar and lidar could be to blame.\n\nWhile Tesla bulls, like Ark Investment, will parrot that Tesla is training its autonomous vehicles with more data and thus will give it an advantage, so far its real-world applications appear to be falling short.\n\nCruise has had past issues\n\nGM's Cruise unit, meanwhile, has had its own issues. One of its robotaxis was involved in an incident in which the vehicle dragged a pedestrian after the person was hit by another vehicle. California subsequently suspended its license last October, and Cruise then decided to pause all operations.\n\nThe incident led to a number of key leaders at the unit being dismissed. Meanwhile, Cruise has been bleeding money since GM acquired it in 2016.\n\nWhile the deal with Uber is a good step, this safety issue does leave a bit of a cloud over the company. It is currently authorized to operate in three cities: Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix.\n\nTime to buy Alphabet stock\n\nWith Alphabet trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19 next year's analyst estimates, the stock looks cheap. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nGOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts.\n\nAt this point, given Alphabet's valuation, investors are basically getting a free call option on Waymo. If it becomes a big success, investors will win, but if it fails, it really won't hurt them. That is a big difference compared to Tesla, where a lot of the bullish thesis around the stock centers around its future robotaxi business as electric vehicle (EV) growth slows.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $292.25 billion and $325.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.9% and +11.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,000 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell leaves after a news conference at the Federal Reserve Building in Washington, U.S., Dec. 14, 2022. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $200 Right Now",
        "content": "Some of the biggest winners during the current bull market have been artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. The booming demand for AI infrastructure, software, and development tools has made some companies and their investors a ton of money over the past two years. Despite the strong growth in AI, there may be a lot more left to come.\n\nBusinesses will spend a whopping $235 billion on AI this year, according to a report by market researcher IDC. But those same analysts expect spending to climb to $631 billion by 2028. By 2032, spending on generative AI alone could climb to $1.3 trillion, according to an analysis from Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nNow that many companies connected to the AI boom have seen their share prices zoom higher, it may feel impossible to find an AI stock you can buy with just $200. While many brokerages allow for fractional share trading, there's something great about owning an entire share of a company. Here are three AI stocks you can buy trading at less than $200 per share that look like no-brainer investments right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Broadcom ($163/share)\n\nBroadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock price recently dropped below $200 per share for the first time since 2020 -- not because investors are selling shares or because the business is struggling, but because it conducted a 10-for-1 stock split in July. Its market cap has climbed by nearly 10 times from its 2020 low, but it could have more room to run.\n\nThe chipmaker specializes in a couple of types of semiconductors that are extremely valuable amid the AI boom. It makes networking chips, which help route workloads across the computing power available in a data center. For example, its Jericho3-AI Fabric can connect up to 32,000 chips in a data center. That helps ensure that big tech companies spending tens of billions on GPUs and other chips are getting their money's worth out of those investments.\n\nIt also makes AI accelerator chips specifically tailored to training or using large language models. It works closely with big tech companies like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms to design these application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. They can be less expensive and require less energy to run than GPUs for the same tasks, and they make up a growing share of the hardware in the biggest data centers in the world.\n\nBroadcom also makes chips for other applications, including smartphones, which has proven a stable and growing business. On top of that, it sports a portfolio of enterprise software for mainframe software and virtualization, anchored by the assets it gained in its acquisition of VMware last year. Its broad portfolio combined with its chip business allows it to focus on locking in customers with multiple offerings that all work together well, protecting it from competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the stock's strong performance over the last few years, shares currently trade at just 27.7 times forward earnings. That's a slight premium to the S&P 500's average valuation, but far below other AI chipmakers. Given the multiple sources the company has for potential growth, Broadcom shares should prove a solid investment at their current price.\n\n2. Qualcomm ($175/share)\n\nQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) is best known for making the wireless communication chips that allow your smartphone to connect to your carrier's 5G network. While its business faces a major headwind as one of its biggest customers -- Apple -- moves toward building its own next-generation modems, its business with Android phone makers is growing.\n\nBeyond the stranglehold Qualcomm has on most of the connectivity chips in smartphones, it also makes the core processors inside many Android phones. Its Snapdragon application processing unit is one of the highest-end chips for smartphones, offering manufacturers easy integration with its modems. Additionally, it makes chips for automotive and Internet of Things applications, both growing markets with increasingly high computation and connectivity needs.\n\nQualcomm took a step toward the PC market with its AI-focused CPUs earlier this year. While its efforts in the area likely won't have a large impact on its revenue in the near term, they could result in great diversification eventually.\n\nImportantly, Qualcomm stands to benefit from the push to start providing the computing power for generative AI on devices instead of having all of that processing done in the cloud. The upcoming new AI features that Apple unveiled in June are primarily focused on this on-device processing. Many other companies will look to emulate Apple in that regard. Qualcomm stresses the idea that its PC chips can handle AI applications on devices without an internet connection. And AI applications in automobiles and IoT networks will need to be able to run quickly and locally as well. Those trends bode well for sales of Qualcomm's high-end chips.\n\nQualcomm trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 15.5. That's well below the S&P 500's multiple despite the fact that strong demand from smartphone manufacturers should drive the company's revenue and profits in the short to medium term and AI PC chips could be a long-term growth story for the company. At this valuation, Qualcomm stock looks like a great buy.\n\n3. Alphabet ($165/share)\n\nAlphabet owns the world's most popular search engine (Google) and video-sharing website (YouTube). Those properties are part of a family of internet services that supports the company's core advertising business.\n\nDespite some regulatory pushback, it's unlikely Google's dominance of the internet search market is going anywhere. Additionally, AI assistants like ChatGPT have failed to make a significant dent in its business. In fact, Google is integrating AI into search with its latest feature, AI Overviews, and seeing excellent engagement and satisfaction with the results.\n\nWhile AI is changing its core business, it's fueling growth for Google's cloud computing unit. Google Cloud is the third-largest public cloud platform, and it's growing quickly. The company is investing heavily in AI capabilities with its custom chip designs (helped by Broadcom) and expanding its computing capacity. That has helped it win major contracts with big developers, including Apple, which trained its large language model on Google Cloud's TPUs.\n\nManagement says its generative AI services generated billions in revenue during the first six months of 2024, attracting more than 2 million developers. But there's still a long runway for growth. Google benefits from being able to spend on its own AI development while renting out cloud computing capacity to other developers as well, ensuring it can get the most out of its capital investments.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 21.8. That's in line with the S&P 500, but Alphabet arguably deserves a premium valuation as it benefits from the secular growth of digital advertising and the huge boom in AI cloud spending. Meanwhile, it's using its massive cash flow to buy back shares, providing a boost to earnings per share. As such, earnings growth should remain strong. It looks like a great AI stock to buy while its shares remain below $200.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Good Fast Money Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other fast money stocks.\n\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\n\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\n\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\n\"That’s right. We’re not against rotation; we’re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don’t go down on bad news, we won’t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\n\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\n\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn’t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we’ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it’s really about earnings.\"\n\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\n\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\n\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today’s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today’s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\n\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it’s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed’s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s strong position in global search through Google provides a stable base for its advertising revenue, which continues to grow as more businesses shift to digital platforms. This foundation is strengthened by the success of YouTube and Google Ads, which consistently attract significant advertiser spending, solidifying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s market leadership. In addition to advertising, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Cloud division plays a crucial role in the company's growth, benefiting from the rapidly expanding cloud market. Google Cloud’s innovative services and increasing market share are diversifying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s revenue streams.\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s investments in AI, including advancements in machine learning and autonomous driving through Waymo, place the company at the forefront of technological innovation with the potential for substantial long-term value. Financially, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) demonstrates consistent revenue growth and maintains healthy operating margins, thanks to its strong advertising business. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) exceeded earnings expectations, reporting an EPS of $1.89 compared to the anticipated $1.85. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s substantial cash reserves give it the flexibility to invest in new growth areas and return value to shareholders through share buybacks.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported robust quarterly financials, demonstrating accelerated revenue growth and improved margins from restructuring efforts. The company’s core advertising business is rebounding after a challenging 2022-2023 period, when advertisers curtailed spending due to economic concerns. While this quarter’s exceptional growth rate may not persist, Alphabet’s performance indicates it is likely to exceed our annual projections.\n\nFollowing Meta’s lead, Alphabet is adopting a more stringent approach to expenses. The company continues to reduce headcount and consolidate teams, aiming to counterbalance the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Alphabet’s better-than-expected revenue and earnings underscore both the resilience of its core business and management’s early success in sustainably restructuring the cost base.\n\nNotably, AI advancements are already showing promising results, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving advertiser performance. These developments position Alphabet favorably in an increasingly AI-driven digital landscape.”\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "After a whipsaw month of market action, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) logged its fourth-straight winning month to end August.\n\nFor the month, the S&P 500 added nearly 2.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added almost 1.8% and sits at all-time high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added more than 0.6%.\n\nUS markets will be closed for Labor Day on Monday before attention turns to incoming labor market data set for release throughout the week.\n\nThe August jobs report, due out on Friday, will headline economic releases in the week ahead as investors look to see whether the signs of slowing in the July jobs report were overstated or an early warning of a broader slowdown.\n\nUpdates on job openings and private wage growth are also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nIn corporate news, quarterly reports from Broadcom (AVGO) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) headline a quiet week for earnings releases.\n\nA closer look at labor\n\nIn July, the US economy added 114,00 jobs, well below estimates, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. The report stoked recession fears as concerns about a weakening labor market grew.\n\nBut in the weeks that followed, additional data suggested the US economy remained rather resilient. Unemployment claims, a weekly indicator economists use to track the labor market in between employment reports, have reversed from their upward trend seen in July.\n\nAnd many economists believe this points to weather-related causes impacting the July jobs report to overstate weakness in the labor market.\n\nMorgan Stanley economist Sam Coffin argued in a note to clients last week that a large reason why unemployment hit 4.3% in July was an unusually large increase in temporary layoffs. As the immediate shock to the Texas labor market from Hurricane Beryl subsides, Coffin doesn't see a repeat.\n\nCoffin and the Morgan Stanley economics team forecast that unemployment will fall to 4.2% while the US economy added 185,000 jobs last month.\n\n\"We expect the reacceleration in payrolls to leave the Fed cutting 25bps in September,\" Coffin wrote.\n\nConsensus expectations among economists surveyed by Bloomberg project the US economy added 163,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%. This would mark the first decrease in the unemployment rate since March.\n\nThe Fed has 'leeway'\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases continuing their downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis, economists argue, puts further pressure on next Friday's labor report when deciphering whether or not the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points at its September meeting.\n\n\"A Fed rate cut in September is assured after Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,\" Nationwide senior economist Ben Ayers wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"But the further cooling of inflation could give the Fed leeway to be more aggressive with rate declines at coming meetings, especially if the labor market shows a steep deterioration.\"\n\nAyers added, \"We still project more cautious [25 basis point] cuts at the remaining three FOMC [meetings] of 2024, but the door is open for larger decreases if economic conditions weaken more than expected.\"\n\nAs of Friday, markets were pricing in a roughly 31% chance the Fed opts for a 50 basis point rate cut instead of 25 basis points at its September meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStill, traders have priced a full percentage point of interest rate cuts from the Fed this year. With only three meetings left this year, that means markets expect a larger cut from the Fed at one of its remaining meetings.

(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNot so Magnificent\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reported earnings last week that once again topped estimates. But the stock lagged the following day as investors focused on how Nvidia's pace of surprises, and overall growth, have slowed over the last year.\n\nNotably, the stock's 6% drop didn't spark a broad sell-off in tech or the market as a whole.\n\nInstead, it served as the latest sign that, after two years of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading the market higher, other areas of the market are now outperforming the market's tech leaders.\n\nIn a research note on Friday, Bank of America's head of US equity strategy & quant strategy, Savita Subramanian, highlighted that since a promising inflation reading on July 11, more than 70% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nThe equal-weighted S&P 500, which isn't as influenced by moves in larger stocks given every member of the index holds the same sway, has outperformed the cap-weighted index.\n\nFrom July 11 to Aug. 29, the Magnificent Seven — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia — fell a cumulative 10.2%. Meanwhile, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 gained 4.1%.\n\nAs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out, this has resulted in the Magnificent Seven having its two worst months compared to the S&P 500 since December 2022.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nMarkets closed for the Labor Day holiday.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, August final (48.1 expected, 48 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, July (0.1% expected, -0.3% prior); ISM Manufacturing, August (47.5 expected, 46.8 previously)\n\nEarnings: Gitlab (GTLB), Zscaler (ZS)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, July (8.1 million expected, 8.18 million previously); Factory orders, July (+4.6% expected, -3.3% previously); Durable goods orders, July final (9.9% previously) MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Aug. 30 (+0.5% previously); Fed Beige Book release\n\nEarnings: C3.ai (AI), Casey's (CASY), ChargePoint (CHPT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Hormel Foods (HRL)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: ADP private payrolls, August (+145,000 expected, +122,000 previously); Nonfarm productivity, second quarter-final (2.4% expected, 2.3% previously); Initial jobless claims, Aug. 31 (231,000 previously); S&P global US Services PMI, August final (55.2 previously), S&P Global US composite PMI, August final (54.1 previously); ISM services index, August (50.9 expected, 51.4 previously); Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, August (+9.2% previously)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), DocuSign (DOCU), Nio (NIO)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, August (+163,000 expected, +114,000 previously); Unemployment rate, August (4.2% expected, 4.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, August (+0.3% expected, +0.2% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, August (+3.7% expected, +3.6% previously); Average weekly hours worked, August (34.3 expected, 34.2 previously); Labor force participation rate, August (62.7% expected, 62.7% previously)\n\nEarnings: Big Lots (BIG)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now",
        "content": "Investing in the stock market is a wonderful way to build long-term wealth. But while you might think you need huge sums of capital, that's simply not true. Even relatively modest amounts of money can still get you started.\n\nWith $1,000 ready to put to work, investors should look no further than Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). About three shares of the former can be purchased, while investors can snag one share of the social media powerhouse. Let's take a closer look at these two \"Magnificent Seven\" businesses.\n\nDominating the tech sector\n\nAlphabet and Meta are two of the most valuable companies on earth. And this position has come from them both dominating the tech sector.\n\nAlphabet has an impressive lineup of internet products and services, ranging from Search and Gmail to Android and YouTube, for example. Meta, on the other hand, operates a family of social media apps that combined have almost 3.3 billion daily active users.\n\nThis unmatched reach and user attention has turned both companies into digital advertising juggernauts. Combined, they command 47% of the U.S. market. Given that the industry is projected to see annualized growth of almost 16% on a worldwide basis through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research, these businesses have a powerful secular trend working in their favor.\n\nIn the past five years, Alphabet and Meta have increased their revenue at average yearly rates of 16.8% and 18.3%, respectively. It's not a stretch to think that double-digit top-line gains could continue for several years.\n\nSuperb financials\n\nThere are many companies that are in trouble financially. This could mean they have unsustainable debt loads, or that they simply aren't profitable. Fortunately, Alphabet and Meta don't have any of these issues. In fact, they are some of the most financially sound enterprises on the face of the planet. Both have incredibly strong balance sheets with huge net cash positions.\n\nTo be fair, many younger tech-focused businesses aren't profitable because they are investing so heavily into growth. And the goal is to generate positive earnings at some point in the future. That reasoning makes sense, but a favorable outcome is always far from certain.\n\nThings are different in this instance, though. Because Alphabet and Meta are already scaled platforms, with huge revenue and established business models that benefit from network effects, they are seeing the benefits on the bottom line. They generate sizable earnings on a consistent basis, with operating margins that exceeded 30% last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis allows them to invest heavily in AI initiatives, mainly around building out data centers and other network infrastructure to handle the higher workload. While the ultimate payoff of these efforts remains a question mark, Alphabet and Meta can easily afford the capital expenditures, while also paying dividends and buying back lots of outstanding shares.\n\nDon't forget valuation\n\nAnother variable that can't be skipped when looking at an investment is the valuation. Investors have even more reason to be bullish with this in mind. No matter how wonderful a business looks, if you overpay, forward returns can be disappointing.\n\nOn a forward price-to-earnings basis, these two stocks still look like compelling buys, even after their impressive gains in the past 20 months. Alphabet's multiple of 22 and Meta's multiple of 25 might not be as attractive as they were at the start of 2023, but they are still very reasonable.\n\nThe market is presenting investors with a solid opportunity to buy a couple of the best companies out there. Investing $1,000 in their stocks is a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $731,449!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2029",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence rockstar Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.9 trillion, but the chipmaker has flitted back and forth around $3 trillion for several months. Only two other publicly traded U.S. companies have crossed that threshold: Apple and Microsoft.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) could surpass Nvidia's current valuation to become $3 trillion companies by 2029. What that means for shareholders is detailed below.\n\nAmazon currently has a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. Reaching $3 trillion by 2029 implies a total return of 58%, which equates to 10.7% annually over the next 4.5 years. Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Reaching $3 trillion by 2029 implies a total return of 50%, which equates to 9.4% annually over the next 4.5 years.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Alphabet.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, it runs the most popular online marketplace in the U.S. in terms of visitors, and it accounts for 41% of domestic retail e-commerce sales. The company also has a vast logistics network that supports fulfillment services for sellers and rapid delivery for buyers, which reinforces its leadership position.\n\nAmazon is the third-largest ad tech company in the world, but it dominates retail media, a term that refers to digital advertising services provided by retailers. That matters because retail media is one of the fastest-growing verticals in the digital ad market, according to eMarketer. Additionally, Amazon recently unlocked a new revenue stream by introducing advertising on Prime Video.\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud, and its market share rose one point to 32% in the June quarter. Those share gains reflect aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) services. \"During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined,\" CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts.\n\nGoing forward, eMarketer estimates U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow at 9% annually through 2028, while retail media spending climbs at 24% annually during the same period. Meanwhile, the International Data Corp. (IDC) expects public cloud spending to compound at 19% annually through 2028. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth over the next 4.5 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's how that could earn Amazon a $3 trillion valuation by 2029: Today, the company is worth $1.9 trillion. Revenue could reasonably increase at 12% annually through the end of 2028, in which case the company would hit $3 trillion in market value if shares traded at 3 times sales, a slight discount to its current valuation of 3.1 times sales.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has two important growth engines in digital advertising and cloud computing. The company owns six products that serve more than two billion monthly users. Chief among them are the most popular streaming video platform (YouTube) and leading internet search engine (Google Search). Those platforms let Alphabet efficiently collect information and deliver data-driven advertising to consumers.\n\nAlphabet will account for 27.4% of global digital ad spending this year, per eMarketer. That puts the company more than five percentage points ahead of Meta Platforms, the second largest digital advertiser in the world. Importantly, while Alphabet is losing share across the open internet, dominance in internet search and streaming video should keep it ahead of the competition for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud is the third-largest public cloud, and its market share increase one point to 12% over the past year. Those share gains reflect its status as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions and large language models. \"Year to date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues, and are being used by more than 2 million developers,\" CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the second-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoing forward, eMarketer estimates global digital ad spending will grow at 10% annually through 2028, and the IDC expects public cloud spending to compound at 19% annually during the same period. That gives Alphabet a good shot at double-digit revenue growth over the next 4.5 years, with potential upside from its subsidiary Waymo, a company that operates an autonomous ride-hailing network in several U.S. cities.\n\nHere's how that could earn Alphabet a $3 trillion valuation by 2029. The company currently has a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Revenue could reasonably grow at 10% annually through the end of 2028, in which case the company would hit $3 trillion in market value if shares traded at 6 times sales, a modest discount to its current valuation of 6.4 times sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Walmart is challenging Amazon by going digital",
        "content": "Walmart (WMT) is successfully evolving its business model to better integrate online and in-store shopping, positioning itself to take on e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN), in a move that could put it on the path towards even greater growth, financial firm Baird said in a research note.\n\nThe company’s vision of “creating an omni-channel retail disruptor” is “rapidly becoming reality,” Baird analyst Peter Benedict said. The firm raised its price target on Walmart from $82 to $90.\n\n“Comprehensive business transformations often fall short of ambitious initial aspirations, but that doesn’t appear to be the case with Walmart,” the firm said after it hosted investor meetings with Walmart in Australia last week.\n\nBaird noted that Walmart’s blending of online and in-store shopping – especially in e-commerce – has allowed the company to tap into higher revenue margin streams like advertising, memberships, marketplace, fulfillment services, and data insights. Together, these initiatives could generate around $9 billion in revenue.\n\nWalmart’s recent quarterly earnings report revealed strong financial performance and growing appeal across income levels, particularly among higher-income households. This momentum, combined with favorable market conditions and what Baird calls “several important inflections on tap,” appears to be reinforcing Walmart’s competitive position in the retail market.\n\nWalmart serves 150 million customers weekly, and despite broader concerns about rising prices, the company has seen no major decline in consumer behavior across its platform, Baird notes. Recently, Walmart announced plans to “rollback” prices on 7,000 items.\n\nThe retail giant’s focus on value and convenience has attracted inflation-weary consumers, particularly those from lower-income households, who typically shop at dollar stores. Walmart has also expanded its home delivery service to cover all of its stores, meeting the expectations set by e-commerce competitors. At the same time, Walmart’s growing third-party marketplace and the introduction of more premium house brands, such as Bettergoods, and even a revamp of some of its stores have appealed to those higher-earning consumers.\n\nWith these improvements in place, Walmart is well-positioned to challenge e-commerce giant Amazon. However, Baird analysts note that Walmart’s success in this arena may depend on refining certain operational details. For instance, the firm suggests that tightening food delivery windows could be a key factor in winning over online shoppers who have come to expect rapid service from e-commerce leaders.\n\nA retail showdown could be brewing as Walmart launches its holiday shopping deals week during the same time that Amazon’s second Prime Day event takes place on October 8. Timing of the event is significant, as it forces other retailers (like Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY)) to offer deals to remain relevant in the market.\n\nHowever, this apparent competition may be evolving into a new retail paradigm where multiple giants can thrive simultaneously.\n\n“The old view was that Amazon and Walmart can’t both win,” Baird said. “Now there’s a view that they can both take share.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy.\n\n2024 will go down in history as the year that legendary investor Warren Buffett started showing signs of slowing down after an illustrious career in the investment world. After losing his best friend and longtime partner, Charlie Munger, the Oracle of Omaha increasingly shows signs of relinquishing control of his investment empire.\n\nEven with his investment company becoming the first non-tech giant to hit the $1 trillion mark on market cap, Buffett is slowly relinquishing control after years of tremendous success. Handpicked Greg Abel is now responsible for taking over the Buffett Empire after more than 60 years in the limelight.\n\nREAD ALSO: Carl Icahn Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks to Buy and 10 Best Performing Warren Buffett Stocks in 2024.\n\nAs Abel assumes control in making key investment decisions, Buffett continues sending shockwaves. Nevertheless, he has become a net seller, having trimmed stakes in some high-profile holdings, all but raising concerns about the market outlook.\n\nAt 94, Buffett has seen it all, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the years and generated significant returns for his investors. Since 1965, the billionaire investor has averaged returns of 19.8% through his investment firm, nearly double the 10.2% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Nevertheless, he appears to have hit the peak of his investment career as he became a net seller after one of the longest bull runs.\n\nThe recent sales have taken Buffett’s cash haul to the $300 billion mark, which he can use to purchase a good chunk of the S&P 500 companies. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has shown reluctance to invest in the cash-sitting valuations that have gotten out of hand.\n\nSince Buffett has yet to carry out a massive investment this year, it does not come as a surprise. The advocate of value investing, which involves analyzing the market for undervalued stocks likely to generate long-term value, has been skeptical about valuations.\n\nHis reluctance also comes on outperformance in recent years, becoming extremely difficult due to the sheer size of Buffett’s investment portfolio. “We have no possibility of eye-popping performance” given that “there remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,” Buffett is quoted as saying in an interview with CNBC.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the S&P 500 up by more than 20% for the year, Buffett has indicated that the market might be too expensive to pursue opportunities at current levels. Consequently, he has opted to stay in cash while locking in profits through buybacks and dividends in some of his top investment plays.\n\nNevertheless, the market is still full of some of the best Warren Buffett stocks that analysts see material upside to. In the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rateby 50 basis points and indicating the prospects of further cuts before year-end, opportunities are increasingly emerging around some of Buffett’s top investment plays\n\nEven as Buffett waits for the market to correct to deploy the more than $300 billion at his disposal, there are still opportunities to pursue as interest rates trend down. With that, let’s look at the 8 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts, we sifted through Berkshire Hathaway’s Q2 2024 13F portfolio. We scanned all the 13F holdings and picked the 8 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of September 24.

Yet, the truth behind this excitement goes beyond mere speculation. Users of Amazon’s AI offerings are discovering real benefits from them. As Amazon continues to pour resources into enhancements and new functionalities, it ought to maintain its leading role in cloud computing and secure a larger portion of the market.\n\nThanks to the integration of AI features, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) recorded an 18.8% increase in sales growth in the second quarter under its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. While AI represents one of the biggest catalysts that continue to fuel Amazon’s underlying growth, advertising is also emerging as an important segment.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s advertising division has been one of its most rapidly expanding areas, experiencing a 20% increase in revenue from the previous year, or a $2 billion rise. It already boasts unparalleled visibility for advertisers looking to reach Amazon shoppers through its sponsored ads on its online shopping site, and its latest feature, an ad-supported Prime video service, is opening up new avenues for both advertisers and Amazon.\n\nThe online shopping sector is also showing steady growth, with more units sold than in sales as shoppers look for cheaper deals.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 6th on our list of 8 Best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts.

        "content": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAmong the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOf all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nEven though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.\n\nMicrosoft's diverse revenue streams and strong competitive moats\n\nMicrosoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.\n\nNote that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.\n\nWindows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nWith these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.\n\nMicrosoft's pathways to future growth\n\nIn the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: Microsoft's presentation\n\nFor the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.\n\nConstructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.\n\nMore personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.\n\nThe cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.\n\nSome more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.\n\nWhat bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.\n\nMicrosoft's high valuation is justifiable\n\nConsidering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nAs the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.\n\nThis valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.\n\nTraditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).\n\nIn short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIn view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.\n\n“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.\n\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\n“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.\n\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN): E-Commerce Strength Propel Market Performance\n\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBrad Gerstner’s Stake: $277,184,273\n\nAmazon is also among the top AI picks of Altimeter. Brad likes AMZN because of its e-commerce business.\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\n“Despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,” Cantor said.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nHayden Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we’ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today\n\nSome of our biggest winners in the last two years, have been “re-acceleration” stories. These are cases where once rapidly growing companies suddenly put the brakes on during a weak economy. There could be several reasons for this – customers pulling back during a recession, the company proactively curtailing growth spend as a precaution, needing to cut costs & right-size the business to become profitable quickly, or many other reasons.\n\nBut the commonality seems to be that as soon as growth stops, the market narrative turns suddenly from positive, to “this company is finished”. They go from being valued for many years of rapid growth, to being priced like a mature company that will never realize significant growth again. But often neither scenario is true, with the ultimate future path somewhere in between.\n\nI find the fact this type of opportunity even exists, fascinating. Especially since it seems to happen every bear-market – perhaps indicating it’s embedded in human nature (and thus persistent & likely minable throughout one’s investing career). For example, I gave the examples of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock performance in our Q1 2022 letter (please re-read this piece for more context; LINK)…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video streaming service surpassed its goal of $1.8 billion in upfront advertising commitments for 2025, according to a recent report from The Information.\n\nThe achievement reportedly exceeded Amazon's internal expectations and marks a significant step forward for the platform's advertising business, according to Bank of America analysts in a note Monday.\n\nDespite Prime Video only serving ads for the past nine months, advertisers seem to be seeing strong returns on their investments, BofA noted.\n\nThe analysts highlighted Prime Video's large ad-supported user base of approximately 115 million U.S. viewers, an expanding content slate, including a $1.9 billion annual deal for NBA games, and advanced data and measurement capabilities integrated with Amazon's retail platform.\n\nWhile Amazon's upfront commitments for streaming are impressive, the bank says they still trail behind larger players like Disney and NBCUniversal, which generated $9 billion and $7 billion in upfronts, respectively, in 2022.\n\nEven YouTube, which has made significant strides in TV viewership, reportedly expects to generate around $7 billion in upfronts for 2024.\n\nBofA sees significant growth potential for Amazon's ad business. They estimate that Prime Video could be on track to generate $3.5 billion to $4 billion in ad revenue for 2025, accounting for 5-6% of Amazon's overall ad revenue forecast for the year.\n\nThe analysts had previously estimated that Prime Video could reach $4.6 billion in ad sales by 2025.\n\nFurthermore, BofA believes Amazon's continued investment in live sports, including a $1 billion per year deal for Thursday Night Football, positions the platform to further increase engagement and ad sales.\n\nThe bank remains \"constructive\" on the future growth of Prime Video's ad business, maintaining a Buy rating with a price target of $210 on Amazon shares. They stated, \"Amazon appears well on its way to building an effective streaming ad platform.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon Prime Video’s upfronts reportedly beat internal expectations: BofA\n\nGlenview Capital to push CVS Health to make changes - Wall Street Journal\n\nFord to offer free chargers to EV buyers through year-end\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It’s been just a week since Amazon’s CEO Andy Jassy told his workforce that they will have to return to working in an office five days a week—and already, 73% of Amazon workers are considering quitting in response.\n\nThat’s at least according to the anonymous job review site Blind, which polled 2,585 verified Amazon professionals one day after Jassy sent out the RTO memo.\n\nAlthough employees at the $1.9 trillion tech giant have until January 2025 before they’ll be expected to show face at one of Amazon’s many offices, the data highlights that many are hoping to find a new job before the New Year.\n\nThe majority of corporate Amazon employees reported that they’re not happy with the mandate and are looking for new jobs—or know someone on their team who is.\n\nWhat’s more, over a third said that they know someone at the company who has handed their resignation in because of the announcement.\n\nFortune similarly found in its own investigation that employees are “rage applying” for new jobs and already interviewing for more flexible roles elsewhere.\n\nAmazon didn't respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nTech workers are worried their employer will follow suit\n\nOver 90% of Amazon’s workers are “dissatisfied” with the company’s new in-office policy, according to the Blind poll, and many posted on Blind about their fears that it will inspire other tech giants to follow suit.\n\n“Remote is a thing of the past…” a verified Block professional wrote on Blind. “Amazon will not do this unless they know their peers aren’t going to do something similar in the future.”\n\n“Other companies are gonna do this, enjoy wfh while it lasts people,” a Google worker echoed.\n\n“Pack it up boys, it’s over,” an AT&T employee added. “All tech going to follow and be 5 days a week now.”\n\nIndeed, since Amazon announced it’s summoning workers back to the old ways of working, computer maker Dell has similarly demanded its sales staff to come into the office five days a week—up from three.\n\nHowever, research consistently shows that companies with strict in-office mandates, like Amazon and now Dell, are actually exceptions to the norm.\n\nIn reality, most businesses are becoming more—not less—flexible and have even recently backtracked on their stance around working from home.\n\nResearch suggests Amazon could backtrack on its RTO mandate\n\nFlex Index analyzed office requirements at more than 9,000 companies (who collectively, employ more than 100 million people) and found that around half of U.S. firms asked workers to return to the office last January.\n\nOnly a third have kept their strict five-day in-office mandates in place.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, 37% of employers offer hybrid working instead—up from 20% at the start of 2023.\n\nSeparate research has echoed that CEOs in the tech industry especially have spent the last year backtracking on their RTO mandates.\n\nJust 3% of tech firms are now asking their workers to go into the office full-time—a significant drop from 8% last year—after experiencing more resistance than they had anticipated.\n\nAmazon could suffer the same fate: According to Blind’s report, in addition to a potential mass exodus of current employees, Amazon's hiring managers are already struggling to recruit because of the new mandate.\n\nA verified Microsoft professional who claims to be interviewing for a job at the company revealed that “thousands of candidates are dropping out of Amazon’s recruitment process.”\n\nNow, they say, Amazon's recruiters are “blowing up” their phone and trying to pin down an interview date.\n\n“I just asked the recruiter why they are rushing to hire and he said the hiring managers are pissed that so many candidates dropped out of the pipeline in just the last 24 hours.”\n\n“If you doubt that people would turn down an Amazon offer in a recession, remember that most candidates are still employed and likely working [remotely]…”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Fed Just Lowered Interest Rates. Here's My Top Vanguard ETF to Buy Now.",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut in over four years. More rate cuts could follow and bring down borrowing costs, which could spur consumer spending on goods and services.\n\nThe Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index just posted its largest one-month decline since August 2021, so lower interest rates won't magically flip a switch and lead consumers to go on a buying spree. But over time, lower interest rates could help the consumer discretionary sector, which was hit hard by inflation and higher rates.\n\nA natural way to invest in a rebound in the sector is through an exchange-traded fund (ETF), like the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF(NYSEMKT: VCR). Here's why the low-cost ETF is worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA primer on the ETF\n\nVanguard offers ETFs for all 11 stock market sectors. Its Consumer Discretionary ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.1%, a minimum investment of $1, and a yield of 0.8%. Consumer discretionary was one of the worst-performing sectors in 2024 until recent months. Now, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF is on the cusp of surpassing its all-time high from late 2021.\n\nThe sector covers a wide variety of industries, including online and brick-and-mortar retail, home improvement, homebuilders, car companies, hotels, resorts, cruise lines, restaurants, and more. The sector is quite different than consumer staples, which focuses on basic essentials. Discretionary companies are generally more growth-oriented, while consumer staples companies are more value- and income-oriented.\n\nFrom cyclical headwinds to potential cyclical tailwinds\n\nThe top 10 holdings of the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF indicate what to expect from the fund. However, you may be surprised to learn that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are the two highest-weighted holdings.\n\nAlthough those two are sometimes seen as technology companies, a key part of Amazon's business is selling goods online, while Tesla makes money selling cars -- which are textbook consumer discretionary industries. However, Amazon Web Services and Tesla's potential in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence could be the more valuable aspects of each business longer-term.\n\nCompany Weight in Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF Amazon 22.1% Tesla 11.1% Home Depot(NYSE: HD) 6.6% McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) 3.8% Lowe's Companies(NYSE: LOW) 2.6% Booking Holdings(NASDAQ: BKNG) 2.4% TJX Companies(NYSE: TJX) 2.4% Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) 2% Nike (NYSE: NKE) 1.9% MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) 1.7%\n\nData source: Vanguard.\n\nStory continues\n\nEach of top 10 holdings in the fund would likely benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nLower borrowing costs could lead to more online and in-store shopping, benefiting Amazon, MercadoLibre, Nike, and TJX Companies.\n\nThe auto industry is highly cyclical and can ebb and flow with the broader economy. Lower interest rates reduce financing costs and make it easier for consumers to pay for a big-ticket item like a Tesla vehicle.\n\nNew-home sales volumes can rise in lockstep with home improvement spending. Thirty-year mortgage rates have already fallen from 7.8% last Halloween to 6.1% in less than a year. Lower mortgage rates reduce the cost of borrowing and can have several ripple effects that benefit Home Depot and Lowe's.\n\nLower interest rates can jolt spending on restaurants and travel. Booking Holdings, which owns Priceline, OpenTable, Kayak, and more, thrives when consumers spend money on travel and leisure.\n\nMcDonald's and Starbucks have global footprints, especially in North America and Asia. Both companies depend on high-margin food and drink offerings, which consumers may pay up for if they are more confident about their spending power.\n\nIn sum, lower interest rates positively impact the sector because they incentivize spending on goods and services.\n\nA useful tool to achieve diversification\n\nThe best consumer discretionary companies can use favorable economic conditions to accelerate growth and have what it takes to endure a downturn.\n\nPricing power and brand awareness are essential elements to why Nike can sell a pair of sneakers at a high margin or why consumers gravitate toward Home Depot and Lowe's for their home improvement needs. However, brands can lose favor due to competition or a lack of innovation.\n\nInvesting in an ETF smooths out risk across a variety of companies, which can be especially useful in the consumer discretionary sector. Many investors may prefer the diversification and simplicity that the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF offers.\n\nAnother approach is to use the ETF as a baseline foundational holding and then build positions in the individual names you are most confident in that may only have a small weighting in the ETF.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Sold 72% of Coatue's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap Dual-Industry Leader",
        "content": "On Wall Street, important data releases are a common occurrence. Monthly inflation and jobs reports, coupled with Wall Street's leading businesses reporting their quarterly operating results over a six-week stretch every quarter, can make it easy for a key data release to slip under the radar.\n\nAug. 14 marked what can arguably be described as the most important data dump of the third quarter. This was the last day to for institutional investors and wealthy asset managers to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details which stocks Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (i.e., the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt was a particularly busy quarter of additions and subtractions for billionaire Philippe Laffont at Coatue Management. Laffont's hedge fund, which is primarily focused on higher-growth tech stocks, oversees more than $25 billion in assets spread across 74 holdings.\n\nWhat's most noteworthy about Laffont's trading activity has been his continued selling of former top holdingNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), as well as his purchasing of shares of a company that's a leader in two industries.\n\nLaffont's fund has shed nearly three-quarters of its Nvidia stake in 15 months\n\nWhen March 2023 came to a close, Coatue Management held a split-adjusted 49,802,020 shares of Nvidia stock. I say \"split-adjusted,\" because the king of artificial intelligence (AI) completed a historic 10-for-1 forward stock split in June 2024.\n\nBut when the curtain closed on the second quarter, Laffont's fund was holding \"just\" 13,754,447 shares of Nvidia. This equates to a 72% decline over 15 months and dropped Nvidia from Coatue's top holding by market value to No. 4.\n\nProfit-taking may explain some of Laffont's persistent selling. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's shares have increased by nearly 750%, with the company tacking on around $2.7 trillion in market value. We've never witnessed the valuation of a market-leading businesses expand so quickly, which may be encouraging Laffont and his team to ring the register.\n\nBut there may be more to this selling than meets the eye.\n\nFor example, every game-changing innovation, technology, and trend since the advent of the internet has endured an early innings bubble. These bubbles consistently occur because investors overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will be adopted by consumers and/or businesses. Invariably, every one of these new technologies, innovations, and trends needs time to mature, which is seemingly never baked into investor expectations. More than likely, AI is the next in a long line of overhyped innovations that will need time to mature.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia's management team and board aren't giving billionaires or everyday investors reasons to be excited. Not one Nvidia insider has purchased shares of their company on the open market since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress in December 2020. Almost four years without insider buying sends a crystal-clear message to Wall Street that shares aren't attractive.\n\nLaffont and his advisors may also be anticipating competitive pressures picking up for Nvidia in the coming quarters. A number of chipmakers have debuted or are in the process of developing AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) that will compete directly with Nvidia's popular H100 and coming Blackwell GPU architecture.\n\nFurthermore, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing GPU platforms of their own. Even if these customers choose to simply complement the Nvidia hardware they've purchased, this looks to be a clear signal that future order opportunities will be limited.\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont has been dumping shares of Nvidia, he's been piling into a historically cheap company that sits at the top of the pecking order in two industries. Image source: Amazon.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont can't get enough of this historically inexpensive dual-industry leader\n\nAlthough Laffont and his team added to 21 existing positions and opened stakes in six others during the June-ended quarter, the purchase that really stands out is the 702,235 shares added to Coatue's existing position in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The roughly 10.77 million shares of Amazon held by Coatue equates to more than 7% of invested assets (as of June 30), and is the fund's second-largest holding by market value, behind only Meta Platforms.\n\nMost investors are familiar with Amazon because it's the undisputed e-commerce leader. In 2023, it accounted for nearly 38% of domestic online retail market share, which is more than 31 percentage points ahead of Walmart, which occupied the No. 2 spot.\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce presence is the face of the company and helps to draw more than 3 billion visits each month, online retail sales generate menial margins and minimal operating cash flow. The bulk of what makes Amazon special can be traced to its three ancillary operating segments, none of which is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAccording to data from tech analysis firm Canalys, AWS accounted for a 33% share of global spend for cloud infrastructure service platforms in the June-ended quarter. This is well ahead of the 20% market share for Microsoft's Azure, which is the No. 2 cloud infrastructure service provider.\n\nEnterprise cloud-service spending is still in its relatively early stages of expansion. To boot, the AI revolution is sparking plenty of interest in generative AI solutions and large language models, which are being incorporated into AWS for clients. AWS consistently accounts for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income on a quarterly basis and is responsible for a sizable percentage of the company's rapid growth in cash flow.\n\nThe other two ancillary segments of importance include advertising services and subscription services. With over 3 billion visitors each month and an expanding content library, Amazon is having no trouble commanding strong ad-pricing power.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon recently landed an 11-year streaming rights deal with the NBA and WNBA, and is the exclusive streaming partner of the NFL's Thursday Night Football. Securing popular sports packages will only increase the value of Prime subscriptions.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle that looks to have Laffont favoring Amazon over Nvidia is its historically cheap valuation. Throughout the 2010s, investors paid a median of 30 times cash flow to own shares of Amazon. As of this writing on Sept. 26, shares are valued at less than 13 times cash flow for 2025.\n\nWith a valuation that's more compelling than, arguably, any point in its publicly traded existence, Amazon has the tools and intangibles needed to outpace Nvidia in the return department.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\n\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\n\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Anthropic is on track to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year and has plans to raise funding at a valuation of over $40 billion.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.\n\n“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”\n\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.\n\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\n“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.\n\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings.

Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Trending AI Stock to Watch for the Rest of 2024?\n\n25 best things to buy on Amazon under $20 (Photo credit: Pixabay)\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nAnthropic, the AI startup supported by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), is projected to hit $1 billion in revenue this year, according to CNBC. This marks a staggering growth of around 1,000% year-over-year, as reported by Deidre Bosa, who cited an internal document. Notably, third-party API access is expected to contribute 60% to 75% of this total revenue.\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested a total of $4 billion in Anthropic, including a $2.75 billion investment made in March. Other backers of the startup include Google and Salesforce.\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,” Cantor said.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a first-of-its-kind state bill that would potentially enact the most impactful artificial intelligence regulation in the country.\n\nThe measure, known as the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act, would require safety measures from companies that spend more than $100 million to train AI models. It aims to prevent potential harms by AI such as mass casualty events, and includes implementing a \"kill switch\" to completely shut down a rogue model.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of AI's biggest players including: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (GOOG), and Meta (META). However, in his veto message on Sunday afternoon Newsom said SB 1047 is \"well-intentioned,\" but it \"does not take into account whether an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical decision-making or the use of sensitive data. Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real threats posed by the technology.”\n\nAlong with the veto, Newsom announced he's working with leading experts — including \"the godmother of AI\" Fei-Fei Li — to set guardrails around the deployment of GenAI. He also ordered state agencies to expand their assessment of the risks associated with the technology.\n\nRegulating the technology has been a flashpoint in Silicon Valley and beyond. OpenAI, Google and Meta publicly opposed the bill. Anthropic, backed by Amazon (AMZN), cautiously supported it after suggesting amendments to its original version.\n\nDespite the pushback from big tech, more than 100 current and former employees from Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic called on Newsom to sign the legislation earlier this month, expressing concerns that “the most powerful AI models may soon pose severe risks.”\n\nMore than 125 Hollywood actors, directors and entertainment leaders had also urged Newsom to sign the bill, writing in a letter: \"we fully believe in the dazzling potential of AI to be used for good. But we must also be realistic about the risks.\"\n\nSB 1047 had to thread the needle between encouraging innovation in the rapidly changing industry while ensuring the tech is used responsibly.\n\nNewsom discussed his concerns over SB 1047 with Salesforce (CRM) CEO, Marc Benioff, at the annual Dreamforce conference earlier this month. “The impact of signing wrong bills over the course of a few years could have a profound impact,\" Newsom said referring to the state's competitiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This is a space where we dominate and I want to maintain our dominance. I want to maintain our innovation. I want to maintain our ecosystem. I want to continue to lead. At the same time, you feel a deep sense of responsibility to address some of those more extreme concerns that I think many of us have, even the biggest and strongest promoters of this technology have.\"\n\nSupporters of the legislation include billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, who owns large AI model company xAI, along with the so-called \"Godfathers of AI\": Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton. California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nThe main author of the bill, California state Senator Scott Wiener, has said it's a reasonable framework for an under-regulated technology. Wiener has been vocal about the need for a strong federal law that would set nationwide guardrails for all developers.\n\nHowever, Wiener isn't hopeful that a national AI safety bill will be a reality anytime soon, calling congress \"completely paralyzed when it comes to technology policy\" at a press conference last month.\n\n\"Let me be clear - I agree with the author - we cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public,\" Newsom wrote, adding \"I do not agree, however, that to keep the public safe, we must settle for a solution that is not informed by an empirical trajectory analysis of Al systems and capabilities. Ultimately, any framework for effectively regulating Al needs to keep pace with the technology itself.\"\n\nThe bill was set to reshape the future of AI and numerous tech executives have spoken out.\n\n\"There are risks associated with AI, less to do with the models themselves and more to do with what the models are allowed to do in the real world if left completely unsupervised,\" Affirm (AFRM) CEO, Max Levchin, told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference.\n\n\"So I'm not diminishing or dismissing the need for controls, and model governance and oversight and thoughtful rule making. I would just not want to 'shut it all down' to quote another AI doomerist.\"\n\nAlthough the bill flew past the state assembly 48-16 (7 democrats voted no) and Senate 30-9 (one democrat voted no) in August, it's faced some political opposition from California Democrats.\n\nCritics of SB 1047 include eight California house members — Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna G. Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan, Lou Correa — and longtime Newsom ally former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIn the last month, Newsom has signed 17 AI-related bills aimed at combating deepfake election content, protecting actors and entertainers over their digital likeness, regulating sexually explicit content created by AI among other measures.\n\nThe new set of laws will require developers and social media companies to prevent irresponsible use of its platform using deceptive content.\n\nWhile those legislation address the immediate dangers of AI, SB 1047 looks ahead at some of the most extreme risks posed by advanced models.\n\nWhile speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Joe Biden called on world leaders to establish AI standards that protect human life.\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we need to do to manage this new technology,\" President Biden said. \"In the years ahead, there may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with AI.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are up 12% in the last three years, recently surpassing their all-time high, set in 2021. But did you know that the stock has materially underperformed the S&P 500 index over that time span? That's right: The broad market index is up 34% in the last three years, handily beating the returns of the e-commerce and cloud computing company.\n\nThis is one of the longest stretches of underperformance in Amazon's history. Yet, if we look at the underlying financials, the company is doing phenomenally well. Revenue is growing by double digits, with profit margins inflecting higher. If this continues, where does that put Amazon's stock three years from now?\n\nLet's analyze further and find out.\n\nBig drivers of revenue growth\n\nLast quarter, Amazon's revenue grew by 10% year over year to $148 billion. It is one of the largest sales generators in the world due to its dominance in e-commerce in the United States and a few other markets worldwide.\n\nAnd let's not forget the cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It generates around $100 billion in revenue every year and grew sales by 19% year over year last quarter.\n\nInvestors should expect continued growth from both of these divisions due to the tailwinds for each one. E-commerce is still just roughly 16% of overall retail sales in the United States. While every transaction is not going online, the trend has been up and to the right for multiple decades now and shows no signs of slowing down. Amazon will benefit as overall retail spending grows in the United States and e-commerce eats up more of this pie.\n\nFor cloud computing, the situation is similar. It remains a small percentage of overall IT spending, with analysts projecting annual total sector growth of 19.4% from 2024 to 2028. This is another tailwind for the company.\n\nAdd everything together, and I believe it's possible for Amazon to grow its overall revenue by 10% per year for the next three years, if not longer.\n\nContinued margin expansion\n\nCombined with revenue growth, Amazon is seeing nice margin expansion as both its e-commerce and cloud computing divisions scale up. Operating margin over the last 12 months has hit 9%, which is an all-time high.\n\nThree key segments are driving this margin expansion with their high profitability. We already talked about one: AWS. It has operating margins of 30%-plus, and they are growing faster than overall sales. The other two segments are third-party seller services (growing 13% year over year) and advertising (up 20%).\n\nAll three of these segments come with better profit margins than the traditional e-commerce business. If these three segments keep growing faster than overall sales, Amazon's operating margin will keep expanding in the next three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides fast growth at its high-margin segments, Amazon has trimmed its workforce. Various divisions have had layoffs in 2023 and 2024, which should lead to even more profit growth. AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nA three-year profit inflection\n\nIn Amazon, we have a double driver of earnings growth: sales and operating margin expansion. Over the next three years, I would expect consolidated revenue to grow by at least 10% annually. Profit margins should expand to at least 15% from 9% today.\n\nOver the last 12 months, revenue was $604 billion. With compound annual revenue growth of 10% for three years, the company will generate $804 billion in sales in 2027. Apply a 15% profit margin to that figure and you have $120 billion in annual operating income. Over the last 12 months, Amazon generated around $50 billion in operating income. So, earnings will more than double in three years.\n\nWe can't precisely predict what the stock price will do over the next three years. But if the company more than doubles its operating earnings -- which I think is very possible given the above estimates -- shareholders will likely be happy buying and holding Amazon for an extended time period.\n\nAs this profit inflection occurs, watch its share price climb higher and higher for the rest of this decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI feel like I have gotten dumber each day of September.\n\nAnd honestly, I have no one to blame but the person looking back in the mirror.\n\nI have mostly spent the month on the West Coast ingesting the latest advances in artificial intelligence. First at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference, then Salesforce's (CRM) annual Dreamforce extravaganza, and currently with AI chats on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (now stationed at the Nasdaq). I'll toss in a Netflix event I went to Thursday night where Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates talked for an hour, mostly on AI and the future of the world.\n\nTechnically, I guess all of these AI discussions are making me a more informed journalist, leader, and human being.\n\nBut sometimes listening to what people deep in the weeds are doing in AI sound like a completely different language. Think Martians speaking on Pluto. And the lingo and development of AI tools and products are moving at a speed multiples faster compared to my last West Coast venture in September 2023.\n\nHard to keep up and not think you have an IQ of 75!\n\nIt already feels like I am way behind the curve on understanding the next wave of AI — and that's alarming because 1) there's potential for at least five more waves to hit civilization; 2) the average person on the street unlikely realizes how their very way of life is about to be affected by an AI-powered agent or some other piece of technology. Bill Gates dives into the future of the world at a Netflix event on Thursday alongside journalist Kara Swisher. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nWe saw that firsthand with the new AI functionality Meta (META) and OpenAI showed off this week for their various products. This was a series of wow moments.\n\nBill Gates proceeded to tell a packed theater that AI will soon become \"superior\" at \"very profound\" tasks. Reassuring!\n\nI also experienced it up close and personal with a real nice German fella named Richard Socher on Opening Bid (video above).\n\nNever heard of the 41-year-old Socher? You should be following his work at search engine You.com, a company he founded. He was the first chief scientist at Salesforce (CEO Marc Benioff was an early backer of You.gov), and he eats, sleeps, and breathes AI.\n\nThe company is now valued at close to $1 billion after an investment led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHere are a couple of quotes from Socher that left an impression:\n\n\"I think over the next few years and maybe decades, almost every company will be hit with some kind of innovator's dilemma in that the way they used to make revenue is going to change because a lot of their processes are going to get automated with AI. And that just changes the nature of the work that you're doing. You need to stop thinking about almost any repetitive process. Every time you feel like, oh, I've done this before, I'm just going through these steps, you should be giving those as a prompt to an agent and then get an accurate AI agent.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think actually in the next few years, we're probably going to see more and more AI agents surfing the web for you than we have people surfing the web, which will change the web as we know it too, and how it often monetizes. But it basically means that a lot of people will get access to their own personal assistant in the way only really wealthy people have right now.\"\n\nYou may be wondering what this all means to you, the investor.\n\nHere are a few notes from me on that front before you go:\n\n2025 is going to be one hell of a year for Nvidia and AMD (AMD). The demand for AI chips only seems to be strengthening. What that means for struggling Intel (INTC), well... This coming earnings season, listen for executives at companies you invest in outline cost-cutting moves by using AI. If you hear crickets, it could be a signal the company doesn't have a great AI strategy in place and risks getting left behind. Today is the day to buy three books on AI to understand the lingo and possibilities — and then think critically on how the technology could be applied to investments you are eying.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $400 Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the current bull market. Big tech companies like Nvidia have pushed the S&P 500 to new all-time highs in 2024. However, the AI boom might still be in the early stages.\n\nThe market for AI hardware and software could grow 40% to 55% per year over the next three years, according to analysts at Bain. That could put total spending on AI close to $1 trillion in 2027.\n\nMany AI stocks already have those high expectations baked into their price, but there are still plenty of opportunities for investors. With just $400, you could buy a share of each of these three businesses, which include hardware, software, and the all-important infrastructure needed to tie it all together.\n\nHere are three no-brainer AI stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest public cloud platform. It operates data centers around the world, renting out computing and storage capacity while providing all the tools needed to build and develop new applications.\n\nThe data-center needs for AI development are set to expand exponentially. While a large data center might cost $1 billion to $4 billion today, it could cost $10 billion to $25 billion five years from now, according to the analysts at Bain. That means more and more businesses and developers will become increasingly reliant on deep-pocketed hyperscale cloud companies like Amazon over the next few years. And the company is investing heavily to meet that demand.\n\nIts capital spending is expected to top $60 billion this year to support the growth in AI workloads. Only a handful of companies can afford that kind of cash outlay. That puts Amazon at a huge advantage to keep growing.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing platform, grew sales 19% in the second quarter. That's slower than its biggest competitors, but it's coming off a bigger base. It also represents an acceleration after growth fell to just 12% in the middle of last year.\n\nThe company is a dominant force in e-commerce, led by its Prime membership program. Strong profits are being driven by its retail media advertising and seller services. And its work to make its logistics network more efficient has translated into strong operating margin expansion over the past year for the $500 billion business.\n\nThe stock currently trades for 42 times free cash flow and an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio of 3.3. The former is near the low end of Amazon's historic range, while the latter is about average. When you consider the accelerating growth in sales and positive trend in free cash flow, the stock looks like a great buy around $195 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), known as TSMC, is the largest chipmaker in the world. Its ability to print transistors on silicon is unparalleled. If any company needs a cutting-edge chip that's high powered and energy efficient, it contracts with TSMC. As such, it accounts for 60% of all spending for chip manufacturing.\n\nTSMC's position as the leading chipmaker creates a virtuous cycle. It generates so much more revenue than its competitors that it can heavily invest in the next generation of manufacturing technology. And that technology lead in turn gives it an edge in attracting the biggest, highest-spending customers.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company uses TSMC because it's the best in the industry \"by an incredible margin.\" While it could use another company if it had to, it would result in lower performance and higher costs for Nvidia.\n\nTSMC stands to benefit as more and more customers look to use its services. The biggest tech companies in the world are ramping up the development and production of their own custom AI chips, and TSMC is in charge of manufacturing them.\n\nAs demand increases on TSMC's limited resources (setting up a new manufacturing facility takes a long time), it should see strong margins on its sales. Management targets a 53% gross margin, but the potential in the near term could be much higher.\n\nThe potential growth might not be fully priced into its stock. Shares trade for just 22 times analysts' consensus earnings expectations for 2025. Meanwhile, AI-driven demand should produce average annual earnings growth above 20% for the next five years, according to analysts. That makes the stock an incredible value at today's price of around $180 per share.\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath(NYSE: PATH) is the market leader in robotic process automation (RPA), which replaces repetitive tasks with software. As businesses look to improve efficiency, its capabilities improve, and developing automation software becomes easier, the company has seen strong growth.\n\nThe company's Business Automation Platform helps enterprises discover new opportunities for efficiencies in their workflows using AI. Once UiPath lands a new customer, it can often expand its business with that customer as it uncovers new ways to streamline the customer's operations.\n\nIts dollar-based net retention rate was 115% in the second quarter, meaning the average UiPath customer spent 15% more than last year.\n\nThat said, the company has disappointed investors lately as competition has curbed its overall growth. Total revenue increased just 10% year over year last quarter, and management expects just 9% growth for the full year. Meanwhile, higher stock-based compensation has weighed on its earnings as measured by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBut there are reasons to be optimistic. UiPath's 115% dollar-based net retention rate and 19% increase in remaining performance obligations suggest it can grow faster in the future. And the market for robotic process automation is set to grow 40% per year through 2030 driven by the cloud service model, an area where UiPath is seeing great success.\n\nThe stock currently trades for around 30 times forward adjusted earnings estimates. With strong operating leverage left in the company and double-digit revenue growth ahead of it, you should expect earnings growth that can more than justify that valuation. At about $12.60 per share, it's worth adding to your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Angry Amazon employees are ‘rage applying’ for new jobs after Andy Jassy’s RTO mandate: ‘I will not go back’",
        "content": "Laura was working from home when her husband forwarded her a link to the news: Amazon tells employees to return to office five days a week. It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute.\n\n“At first, I didn't quite believe it,” she tells Fortune. “After all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.”\n\n“Which, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that's going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn't happen for a couple of days.”\n\nLaura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon’s offices.\n\nThat was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to “go back to being in the office together the majority of the time”—at least, three days per week.\n\n“The original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,” she says.\n\nAfter the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clairty washed over: “My months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.”\n\nEven if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon’s remote work bait and switch.\n\n“Honestly, I've lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,” she adds. “I've been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.”\n\nLaura’s not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they’re so frustrated with the tech giant’s war on working from home that they’re officially on the job hunt.\n\nTwo say the learned the news—and its implications—via the media, rather than a manger.\n\nOne says they’ve already handed their notice in. Another says they’ve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement.\n\nAmazon did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nIs the 5-day mandate a “negotiation game”?\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it’s “not going to work out” for them at the company.\n\nDespite this, it’s clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now.\n\nExperts previously told Fortune that Amazon’s 5-day mandate is a “negotiation game” to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for.\n\n“I was not complying,” Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe briefly considered moving before thinking again: “I decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.”\n\nSome managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect.\n\nOne employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023—a month after the company announced its initial RTO policy.\n\n“I left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,” Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. “For me, it's not that I don't want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.”\n\nHe says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work.\n\n“He told me he would not be able to help, they’ve made him go into an office too,” Luca says, adding that he couldn’t get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room.\n\n“I like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.”\n\nWhether Jassy’s latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he’s given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff—or quit.\n\nMost of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway.\n\nA thinly veiled headcount reduction\n\nWhile Jassy positioned Amazon's changes—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it's a thinly veiled headcount reduction.\n\n“It's a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,” Gen X program manager Jared says.\n\nAlthough he’s only been working at Amazon for six months, he’s already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2.\n\n“The new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,” Jared scoffs. “I will not go back.”\n\nWhile he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon’s competitors are still offering some working from home—and he thinks many others will do the same.\n\n“As a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,” Jared adds.\n\n“One of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.”\n\nHe’s not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit—he took “voluntary termination” two months ago and has now started his own firm.\n\nLikewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy’s announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters.\n\n“This new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,” she says, adding that she has been a “top-rated employee year on year” thanks to working from home.\n\n“I’ve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,” Lisa adds. “I don’t want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.”\n\nEvery job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she’s confident she’ll find a more flexible employer before the New Year.\n\nWithin 48 hours of Amazon’s new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews.\n\n“I will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.”\n\nInterviewee names have been changed for anonymity.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Finding new growth stocks to add to your portfolio usually isn't too difficult. Finding growth stocks to buy and hold forever, however, can be a different story. The underlying company must be capable of evolving over time as its marketplace changes. Just ask Xerox, Kodak, and Blockbuster.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three growth stocks you can comfortably buy and hold for a lifetime. These organizations not only manage businesses that are perpetually in demand, but each has proven willing and able to change as needed to continue growing.\n\nIn no particular order...\n\n1. Amazon\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested stock pick that it's almost become a cliché. Nevertheless, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an investor favorite for all the right reasons. Not only is it the leading e-commerce company in the U.S. (with roughly 40% market share, according to eMarketer), but its sales growth streak remains almost perfectly unfettered. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nGranted, its cloud computing arm -- Amazon Web Services -- has a great deal to do with this uninterrupted growth. AWS accounts for roughly two-thirds of the company's operating income, even though it only contributes about 18% of revenue. The e-commerce side of the business obviously isn't wildly profitable.\n\nIt just doesn't matter.\n\nSee, profitability (or lack thereof) isn't a terribly important part of the argument for or against owning Amazon stock. The reason this company is such a great forever growth holding is its digital ecosystem that makes it so easy to become and remain a customer. There's a reason Amazon Prime customers are eligible for free shipping on their online purchases, and it's not because Amazon is interested in public service. It's because these subscribers ultimately spend more than non-Prime shoppers do.\n\nThere's also a reason Amazon is able to collectively charge its third-party sellers roughly $13 billion per quarter now to prominently feature their goods at Amazon.com. That's the fact that roughly 300 million people shop at one of its websites on a (very) regular basis. Web-traffic measurement outfit Semrush reports Amazon.com alone was visited 3.23 billion times in August.\n\nGiven that well-established habits are hard to break -- especially when they're intended to be sticky -- Amazon is apt to hold on to its commanding lead of North America's e-commerce market as it continues to grow. There's just no rival in a position to threaten the company.\n\nAnd its primary market is nearly certain to keep growing. Despite the business's maturity, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that e-commerce still only makes up around 16% of the nation's total retail sales. That leaves tons of room for more growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nWhile Amazon may be the dominant e-commerce name in North America, know that this dominance only applies here. Outside of the U.S., it doesn't. Indeed, a company called MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is frequently referred to as the \"Amazon of Latin America,\" acknowledging its Amazon-like control of this particular geographic market.\n\nJust as the unofficial comparison suggests, MercadoLibre manages an online-shopping platform serving Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Panama, along with several other Central and South American nations that might otherwise remain untapped.\n\nCalling it the Amazon of Latin America, however, doesn't quite do it justice. In many ways MercadoLibre is also comparable to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal, by virtue of offering merchants a means of doing business with the region's online shoppers. For perspective, the company's e-commerce platforms facilitated $12.6 billion worth of product and service sales during the second quarter of this year, while its payment platform was the middleman for $46.3 billion worth of remittances and transfer. The growth pushed the company's top line up to the tune of 42% year over year, and higher by 113% when excluding the impact of currency-exchange fluctuations. This improvement extends growth streaks that have been in place for some time now.\n\nThis growth is also expected to persist for at least a few more years, as Latin America's e-commerce markets explode in the wake of the proliferation of broadband-capable smartphones. eMarketer predicts Latin America's e-commerce sales will swell from $180 billion this year to more than $260 billion in 2028. MercadoLibre is positioned to at least capture its fair share of this growth, if not more than its fair share.\n\nAs for why this company is doing what Amazon and other outsider players can't, it's not complicated. MercadoLibre was founded by people living in this market, and built from the ground up to serve consumers who may think and act differently than U.S. consumers do. This awareness of local norms and preferences can matter in a big way.\n\n3. PepsiCo\n\nLast but not least, add beverage giant PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) to your list of growth stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\nIt admittedly stretches the definition of what qualifies as a growth stock. It's more often than not categorized as a value name, with its sizable forward-looking dividend yield of 3.2% only bolstering the value argument. Never even mind the fact that bigger rival Coca-Cola is the more frequently suggested pick between the two beverage companies.\n\nGiven the likely net growth you could actually achieve by reinvesting PepsiCo's dividends in more shares of the stock, however, it might be worth a look from a different angle.\n\nPepsiCo is, of course, parent to its namesake cola, as well as popular beverages like Mountain Dew, 7UP, Bubly water, and Gatorade, just to name a few. This is also parent to snack chip company Frito-Lay, the name behind Lay's potato chips, Doritos, Cheetos, and others. Although PepsiCo's chips business is the smaller of the two arms, it's a great product mix aimed at the same basic consumer.\n\nIt's also distinctly different than its top rival in another way. Whereas Coca-Cola punts most of its production and other frontline work to third-party bottling partners, PepsiCo owns the bulk of its bottling operations, maintaining close control of its packaging process. This ultimately translates into thinner profit margins (bottling operations are expensive to run these days), but it allows the company to fine-tune every facet of the production process. It even allows the company to perform revenue-bearing bottling duties for beverage brands other than its own.\n\nAnd this flexibility is making a fiscal difference. PepsiCo's dividend growth has quietly outpaced Coca-Cola's for some time now. Some of the credit is given to PepsiCo's more aggressive stock-repurchase efforts. Much of the credit, however, simply stems from the fact that PepsiCo prioritizes the growth of its dividend payments funded by predictable control of its business. PEP Dividend Chart\n\nMore important to investors, PepsiCo's 52-year streak of annual dividend growth has proven very fruitful to investors who reinvested those payments. A $10,000 investment in PepsiCo stock back in 1984 would be worth nearly $1.7 million today, had you used its cash dividends to purchase more shares. Although it takes some time and patience to achieve it, the resulting average annualized net return of around 12% is certainly characteristic of a growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Brilliant AI Stocks Billionaires Are Buying for the 3 Stages of the Artificial Intelligence Boom",
        "content": "A recent report from UBS Global Wealth Management estimates that artificial intelligence revenue will reach $1.2 trillion by 2027. The analysts believe \"AI will be the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history.\"\n\nThe report breaks the investment opportunity into three layers: (1) the enabling layer, (2) the intelligence layer, and (3) the application layer. Listed below are three brilliant AI stocks (one for each layer) that billionaires were buying in the second quarter.\n\nAndreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors bought 1.3 million shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors bought 1.1 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). David Shaw at D.E. Shaw & Co. bought 689,000 shares of Datadog(NASDAQ: DDOG).\n\nHere's what investors should about those stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia: The enabling layer\n\nUBS analysts define the first stage of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom as the enabling layer. It comprises semiconductor companies and public clouds that provide infrastructure and platform services required to develop AI applications. UBS estimates revenue from the enabling layer will total $516 billion by 2027.\n\nNvidia fits neatly into this category. The most obvious reason for its inclusion is dominance in data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and it holds 90% market share in AI chips according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Without Nvidia's GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia also provides software libraries and developer tools through its CUDA platform that streamline the building of GPU-accelerated applications. Additionally, the company has also launched a complete AI-as-a-service product called DGX Cloud. It brings together supercomputing infrastructure, pretrained machine learning models, and software that support AI application development across use cases ranging from autonomous robots to recommender systems.\n\nLooking ahead, Nvidia is well positioned to hold its leadership position in AI chips despite increasingly tough competition from semiconductor companies like AMD and Broadcom. To quote Forrester Research, \"The company's innovation, roadmap, and vision are clear and have kept it moving at lightspeed compared to other semiconductor manufacturers for AI chips.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to compound at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 57 times earnings look like a reasonable entry point. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is a material discount to the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon: The intelligence layer\n\nUBS analysts define the second stage of the artificial intelligence boom as the intelligence layer. It comprises companies that use data assets to build the large language models (LLMs) and machine learning models that power artificial intelligence applications. UBS estimates revenue from the intelligence layer will total $255 billion in 2027.\n\nAmazon fits neatly into the first and second categories. Amazon Web Services, the largest public cloud in terms of revenue, provides access to infrastructure and platform services that support the development of AI models and applications. Amazon Bedrock is one example. It's a generative AI development platform that lets businesses fine-tune pretrained models, including the Titan family of models developed by Amazon.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon shoppers spend $443,000 per minute on the marketplace, according to Goldman Sachs. That affords the company a deep understanding of consumer tastes and preference, and its generative AI shopping assistant (Rufus) uses that information to answer questions and make product recommendations. As of Sept. 18, Rufus is officially available to all U.S. customers.\n\nAccording to a recent survey of IT executives from Goldman Sachs, approximately 30% of applications run in public clouds today, but that number is projected to approach 50% in three years. As the largest public cloud, Amazon Web Services is uniquely positioned to benefit as demand for AI services increases, simply because it already has the largest customer base and partner ecosystem.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 22% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 45 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 2.1, a discount to the three-year average of 2.9.\n\n3. Datadog: The application layer\n\nUBS analysts define the third stage of the artificial intelligence boom as the application layer. It comprises companies that use data assets and models from the intelligence layer to develop AI software. UBS estimates revenue from the application layer will total $395 billion in 2027.\n\nDatadog fits into this category. The company specializes in observability software. Its platform comprises a broad range of products that help businesses monitor, troubleshoot, and evaluate the performance of critical IT infrastructure and applications. Several products depend on AI. For instance, Watchdog is an AI engine that accelerates incident resolution by automating anomaly detection and root cause analysis\n\nSimilarly, Bits AI is a conversational interface that lets development and operations teams query observability data using natural language. It simplifies investigations, streamlines incident management, and speeds up the remediation of performance problems. Likewise, LLM Observability is a monitoring tool purpose-built for the large language models that power generative AI applications.\n\nResearch company Gartner recently ranked Datadog as a leading observability platform vendor for the fourth consecutive year. The company also has a strong presence in several individual observability verticals, such as log analysis, sever monitoring, and application performance monitoring. Additionally, Forrester Research has recognized its leadership in AI for IT operations.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh views Datadog as one of the software companies best positioned to monetize generative AI. Wall Street expects the company's revenue to grow at 23% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 17.9 times sales look like a reasonable entry point for patient investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NVDA) Is Still a Long-Term Winner, No Matter the Noise",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) prodigy Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s third-highest-valued stock, experienced a material decline in market capitalization following its Q2 earnings in late August. However, NVDA stock has shown some vigor again, rising 5% in the last week. After temporarily surpassing the $3 trillion milestone earlier this year, investors are wondering what the future will hold.  My thesis remains unchanged — I’m bullish on NVDA shares as an investment due to its clear AI supremacy and exponential growth potential.\n\nNVDA’s Long-Term AI-Driven Growth Trajectory Remains Intact\n\nIt is well known that NVDA is positioned for a long runway of growth with top-notch clients like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) bulking up on their AI efforts. However, beyond these leading customers, Nvidia’s AI penetration is still rising across all industries, increasing my optimism for NVDA stock. Enterprises across industries and geographies are eager to incorporate AI benefits into their operations. Likewise, NVDA continues to enter into collaborations with top businesses.\n\nThere’s a reason enterprises are flocking to NVDA for their AI ambitions. Beyond being the leader in AI GPU processors, NVDA provides a complete end-to-end AI infrastructure that supercharges productivity. That’s something that few, if any, of its global AI peers can deliver.\n\nNVDA Remains a One-Stop AI Powerhouse with Margin Growth\n\nAnother reason for my optimism about NVDA is CEO Jensen Huang‘s relentless focus. He is committed to transforming NVDA into a fully AI-driven data center powerhouse that covers all aspects of hardware and software under the NVDA brand.\n\nThis strategy is a key reason why NVDA can maintain premium pricing for its products, contributing to steady growth in its profit margins. However, critics argue that NVDA’s exceptional revenue and margin growth may not be sustainable. Some members of the investment community are worried about a slowdown in revenue growth over the coming years.\n\nFor context, NVDA reported an extraordinary 217% increase in its data center revenues for fiscal 2024. While that growth is expected to moderate to around 130% in 2025, this remains an impressive triple-digit figure, especially considering the strong FY2024 baseline for comparison. Although lower than today’s pace, these are still remarkable growth projections for the future. I view bullish analyst estimates as a reason to remain confident in this AI leader, particularly as the disruptive potential of generative AI is only beginning to unfold.\n\nDemand for NVDA’s chips is robust and will boost future revenues in the coming quarters. Therefore, despite some investor concerns, I expect NVDA will continue to maintain its clear AI dominance with an unbeatable competitive moat and best-in-class AI products and services.\n\nA Discussion of Nvidia’s Impressive Quarterly Earnings\n\nNvidia posted yet another stellar Q2 result on August 28, 2024, driven by accelerated computing and the continued momentum of generative AI. Adjusted earnings of $0.68 per share handily beat the consensus analyst estimate of $0.65 per share. The figure came in much higher (+152%) than the Fiscal Q2-2023 figure of $0.27 per share.\n\nThe company posted a 122% year-over-year revenue growth, delivering $30.04 billion for the three months ending July 31 and surpassing analysts’ projections. Importantly, Data Center revenues, the company’s crown-jewel division, grew 154% year-over-year to $26.3 billion. Additionally NVDA’s adjusted gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 75.1% from 70.1% a year ago. Many investors were apparently hoping for even bigger numbers, and therefore the stock dropped slightly following the Q2 report. Shares then continued a downtrend until they bottomed out on September 6, just above the $100 level.\n\nNvidia’s guidance for the 3rd quarter appeared less promising to investors, with revenues expected to reach about $32.5 billion. Guidance came in below expectations. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to level off at about 75%, versus 75.15% delivered in Q2.\n\nNVDA’s Insider Selling Concerns are Over\n\nInsider selling at Nvidia added downward pressure on NVDA shares in recent months. CEO Jensen Huang sold NVDA shares across multiple transactions from June to September, but it’s important to know that those sales were part of a predetermined trading plan adopted in March. This plan allowed Huang to sell up to six million NVDA shares by the end of Q1 2025.\n\nNotably, Huang has completed sales of more than $700 million worth of NVDA stock. Despite the significance of these sales, he remains the largest individual shareholder of the company. At last report, Huang held 786 million shares through various trusts and partnerships, and 75.3 million shares directly, according to company filings. Combined, Huang controls a ~3.5% stake in the company, with an approximate total of 859 million shares.\n\nNVDA Valuation Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Growth Prowess\n\nInvestors may have been hesitant to buy NVDA stock at current levels, pointing to the stock’s extraordinary run as well as due to concerns about the company’s and slowing growth.\n\nOn the contrary, however, my contention is that NVDA stock is not as expensive as it may seem. Currently, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio of about 43x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is actually cheaper than some valuation multiples of its peers. For instance, NVDA’s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, Advanced Micro Devices, carries a 46.8x forward P/E. Interestingly, NVDA’s current valuation still reflects a 10% discount to its five-year average forward P/E of 47.3x.\n\nGiven NVDA’s consistent outperformance and strong growth potential, the current valuation appears reasonable and justified. Any future dip in the stock price could represent a solid buying opportunity, in my opinion, especially considering Nvidia’s immense potential in the rapidly expanding AI market.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nWith 39 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus TipRanks rating is a Strong Buy. The average Nvidia stock target price of $152.44 implies potential upside of about 26% for the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nDespite recent weakness, NVDA shares have nearly tripled over the past year compared to a rise of about 37% for the Nasdaq 100. The post-earnings sell-off for NVDA stock, in my view, was largely driven by profit-taking. After bottoming near $100, the stock appears to be in recovery mode now.\n\nIn the near term, I believe ongoing economic and political uncertainties may keep the stock range-bound. However, I view any dips as buying opportunities. I see NVDA as a strong long-term investment given the significant continued potential of AI.\n\nRead full Disclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Best Performing Dow Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks on our list of the best-performing Dow stocks in 2024.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the most closely watched stock indices globally, often considered a barometer of the overall health and trajectory of the American economy. As a price-weighted index, it is composed of 30 blue-chip companies from various sectors, excluding transportation and utilities. The Dow’s inclusion of companies from diverse industries such as technology, healthcare, finance, and consumer goods makes it a valuable indicator of market trends. Created in 1896 by Charles Dow, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stood the test of time and, alongside the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500, remains one of the most recognized and influential stock market indices in the world.\n\nThe Dow’s journey over the past century has been marked by numerous highs and lows, often reflecting the broader economic conditions. For instance, the index experienced some of its worst single-day losses during the 2008 financial crisis. On September 29, 2008, the Dow plunged by 777.68 points, which was its largest single-day point drop at the time. The financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a series of banking failures, led to panic selling across global markets. That year, the Dow lost nearly 34% of its value, marking one of its worst annual performances. On the flip side, some of the best years in the Dow’s history include 1915, when it rose by a staggering 81.66%, and 1933, when it registered an annual gain of 63.74% amid a recovery from the Great Depression.\n\nFast forward to 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has continued its volatile yet upward trajectory. As of September 20, 2024, the Dow closed at a new record high of 42,063.36 points, inching up by 38.17 points or 0.09% for the day. This milestone was reached after a period of substantial gains following the Federal Reserve’s decision to ease interest rates—the first such move in four years. The easing of monetary policy has provided a boost to the market, with investor sentiment improving and confidence in the resilience of the American economy strengthening.\n\nDespite some mid-week volatility in the broader market, the Dow is expected to end September on a positive note. This rally was notable, considering the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which has led many investors to take a cautious stance and refrain from making significant commitments until the political landscape becomes clearer. Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, highlighted this hesitancy during an appearance on CNBC’s “Closing Bell,” noting that “a lot of investors don’t want to commit capital until after Election Day. I don’t think it matters who wins; they just want to get that event behind them.”\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the Dow has shown remarkable resilience, tracking to end the month of September higher. The 30-stock index has hit several fresh all-time highs throughout the year, demonstrating robust performance across key sectors. In fact, as of September 25, 2024, the Dow had reached a 52-week high of 42,299.64 points, representing a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 11.21% and a one-year change of 23.25%. These figures underscore the strength of the index and the performance of its constituent companies.\n\nThe success of the Dow in 2024 can be attributed to a range of factors. For one, leading technology and consumer goods companies, which form a significant part of the index, have continued to post strong earnings amid solid consumer demand and operational efficiencies. Moreover, the financial sector has also benefitted from the recent shifts in monetary policy, with lower interest rates driving increased borrowing and investment activities. Additionally, healthcare companies have maintained growth trajectories, as innovation and demand for services remain high in the post-pandemic era.\n\nThe top-performing stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024 have played a pivotal role in driving the index to record highs. These companies, known for their strong fundamentals, market leadership, and robust financial health, have outpaced broader market expectations. Investors seeking exposure to blue-chip companies with a track record of stability and consistent returns have found the Dow to be an attractive option.\n\nIn this article, we will delve into the 10 best-performing Dow stocks in 2024. From established technology giants to consumer staples that continue to dominate their respective industries, these stocks have led the charge in pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new heights.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we utilized a stock screener to identify DJIA index stocks that have shown significant gains year-to-date as of September 25, 2024. We arranged these stocks in ascending order based on their performance. Additionally, we examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, noting the number of hedge fund holders for each as of the end of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nYear to date Share Price Gain: 26.71%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) demonstrated exceptional financial performance in Q2 2024, significantly exceeding market expectations with an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 compared to forecasts of $1.03. The company reported revenues of $148 billion, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, and a remarkable operating income of $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year. These robust results reflect Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ability to navigate economic challenges and leverage growth opportunities effectively.\n\nOne of the standout highlights from the earnings release was the dramatic increase in free cash flow, which surged 664% to $51.4 billion over the trailing twelve months. This metric underscores Amazon’s operational efficiency and cash-generating capabilities, allowing for strategic reinvestment in core areas such as AWS and AI-driven services. The AWS segment showcased continued strength, with revenue growth accelerating from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by trends in cloud migration and increasing demand for AI capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising business is on an upward trajectory, generating over $50 billion in revenue in the last year. The ongoing improvements in ad technology and the integration of AI in ad services present significant growth prospects, indicating that Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on this market.\n\nThe company’s strategic investments in generative AI and machine learning are also promising. The introduction of products like Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock positions Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a leader in the cloud computing landscape, catering to a growing number of developers and businesses eager to leverage AI technologies.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains strong, evidenced by a year-to-date share price gain of 26.71% and an increase in hedge fund holders, which rose to 308 as of Q2 2024, up from 302 in the previous quarter. These factors collectively create a compelling investment narrative for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it a standout performer in the Dow, particularly as it continues to innovate and expand its market presence across diverse sectors.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best-performing Dow stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of  AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Still a Good Investment Prospect",
        "content": "Nvidia has been an AI juggernaut for the past couple of years as it challenges for the title of the world’s most valuable corporation. Nvidia’s 156% year-to-date gain and 2,700% gain over the past five years may lead many to suspect there’s limited upside from here, but artificial intelligence is still in its early innings. Understanding the AI opportunity and Nvidia’s unique position in the industry leads me to be bullish on the stock.\n\nDiving into the AI Boom\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence has already captivated investors for multiple years, the boom is still going strong, and that leads to my optimism for NVDA stock. Corporations are making significant investments in artificial intelligence, and that demand has resulted in a projected 19.3% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2034.\n\nArtificial intelligence helps businesses enhance their products and services. For example, CrowdStrike (CRWD) has been investing in Charlotte AI and other AI features to fortify its cybersecurity software. Adobe (ADBE) has also invested in artificial intelligence to help individuals and businesses create better images and videos.\n\nNvidia supplies the AI chips that power these tools. While other semiconductor firms also offer AI chips, Nvidia continues to innovate its chip offerings to stay ahead of the competition. The company is working on its new Blackwell chip, which is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nThe High Cost of AI Infrastructure\n\nRight now, artificial intelligence looks similar to the early days of the internet, in my view. The groundbreaking technology has substantial barriers to entry. Nvidia wins much of the new business, contributing to my bullish outlook for NVDA stock.\n\nBig tech companies within the Magnificent Seven have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology. Oracle (ORCL) founder Larry Ellison recently said that the company is behind on its AI infrastructure goals. Oracle will likely turn to Nvidia to close that gap, resulting in billions of dollars of additional sales potentially heading Nvidia’s way. Elon Musk’s companies are also in the fray. Tesla and xAI are set to spend a combined $20 billion on AI projects in 2024 alone.\n\nCorporations aren’t flinching and seem resolved to making additional investments in 2025 and beyond. AI infrastructure is expensive to set up, maintain, and scale. This dynamic benefits Nvidia tremendously as it has established a near monopoly in the industry. According to the IDC, organizations are projected to nearly triple their AI investments by the end of 2028. This research suggests a 30% compounded annual growth rate during that stretch.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s Many Partnerships\n\nNvidia is knocking elbows with the ‘who’s who’ of big tech and publicly traded corporations. It’s another reason to feel bullish about the company’s prospects, and Nvidia’s partners have deep wallets. The AI chipmaker has partnerships with Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and other titans in the industry.\n\nMany of these same tech companies have been reporting record profits. Nvidia’s biggest customers are relatively well-insulated and can continue to pour money into artificial intelligence even during an economic slowdown. The technology’s mainstream appeal is relatively new, and investments are still ramping up. Nvidia’s partnerships make it more likely that the company will continue outgrowing the broader market regardless of whether the economy stalls.\n\nEven better, key partnerships are likely to expand with age. As Nvidia continues to deliver top-class AI chips to its customers, those clients are more likely to stick with Nvidia and make further large investments. Nvidia has been working with Amazon for more than a decade, while Alphabet recently expanded its partnership with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia’s Valuation Isn’t Prohibitive\n\nNvidia’s valuation is still reasonably low in considering its revenue and earnings growth rates. While a 58x trailing P/E ratio seems high, especially when compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia has been more than doubling its net income on year-over-year comparisons.\n\nOn a forward basis, Nvidia stock is priced at a 43.5x P/E ratio, making the valuation look more affordable. Furthermore, the company reported 152% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY25. High revenue growth paves the way for high net income growth. If Nvidia continues to report a few more quarters of triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth, the forward P/E ratio should continue to drop.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy?\n\nNvidia stock is currently rated as a consensus Strong Buy among 42 Wall Street analysts. The average NVDA price target of $152.44 implies about 23% potential upside. The most optimistic price target of $200 reflects 62% upside from current levels. Wall Street analysts carry 39 Buy ratings, three Hold ratings, and no Sell ratings on NVDA stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia is an undisputed leader within the artificial intelligence boom. It has established a leading position in supplying the demand for AI capabilities. Nvidia has some of the best customers on the planet, and these corporations are surely to continue investing in AI even during an economic downturn.\n\nRevenue and net income growth remain superb and, when looking at forward multiples, NVDA stock doesn’t look unreasonably valued. Many Wall Street analysts feel the same way, hence the consensus Strong Buy rating. Alongside them, I continue to be bullish NVDA.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three online sellers operating on Walmart-owned Flipkart have sued the Indian antitrust watchdog over an investigation which found they, Flipkart and rival Amazon breached competition laws, according to court filings seen by Reuters.\n\nThe filings come after antitrust investigations concluded in August found Amazon and Flipkart, some of their sellers and smartphone brands, violated local competition laws by giving undue preference to select online sellers and prioritizing certain listings, Reuters has reported.\n\nFlipkart is one of India's biggest ecommerce players and rivals Amazon.\n\nIn an effort to quash the critical proceedings, the three sellers on the platform made submissions in the High Court of Karnataka to \"set aside\" the investigation report and put the process of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on hold.\n\nLawsuits from sellers of Amazon and Flipkart can potentially delay the investigation process which first started in 2020, and was triggered after brick-and-mortar retailers of the Confederation of All India Traders complained to the watchdog. Amazon and Flipkart deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThree of Flipkart sellers - CIGFIL Retail, Wishery Online, Xonique Ventures - in their lawsuits argue that during the investigation they were called to submit data to help officials, but were later named as accused, which is against due process, court papers show.\n\n\"The alleged investigation ... is arbitrary, opaque, unfair,\" the sellers argued in three separate court filings, which will come up for hearing likely next week.\n\nFlipkart and the CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach the three sellers, whose filings are being reported for the first time.\n\nLast week, a former Amazon seller also sued the CCI and obtained an interim injunction to block the investigation from proceeding. Its court filing - which Reuters has seen - argued the CCI did not give notice before making it an accused in the case.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; editing by Clelia Oziel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "While it can be tempting to bet on flashy, smaller companies, blue chip behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might also have a place in your portfolio. The technology conglomerate is far from its days of heady top-line growth, but cost-cutting and new opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) could still unlock significant shareholder value.\n\nLet's dig deeper into what the next three years could have in store.\n\nTurning e-commerce into a cash cow\n\nOnline shopping has been a part of mainstream American life for decades, making it seem a little boring compared to other technology opportunities. That said, Amazon has exploited that market like nobody else for decades. Now, the company's e-commerce business enjoys some exciting trends that could continue to unfold over the coming years.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue increased by 10% year over year to $148 billion, driven by strong e-commerce sales. Over the last few years, Amazon has dramatically cut costs in its core business -- laying off thousands of redundant workers and streamlining its fulfillment strategy from a national network to a more efficient regionalized model.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has also backed away from more risky ventures like \"just walk out\" checkout-free shopping to focus on more tried and true strategies, including self-checkout grocery carts at its brick-and-mortar Whole Foods stores.\n\nThe reorientation is having a dramatic impact on Amazon's bottom line. The North American e-commerce segment's operating margin jumped 58% year over year to $5.1 billion, while international e-commerce swung from a loss of $895 million to a gain of $273 million. Amazon doesn't break down its profits on a per-country basis. However, some international markets are likely more profitable than others, making this segment a great opportunity for future cost-cutting.\n\nPivoting to new growth drivers\n\nAmazon's future isn't limited to just cost-cutting in its e-commerce business. The company has additional growth drivers investors can be excited about. Within the Amazon Prime ecosystem, video streaming has arguably evolved from a loss leader to an important value creator.\n\nAccording to an Evercore survey, 80% of Prime members watch Prime Video. And it isn't hard to see why. The platform is known for popular shows like The Boys and expanded live sports offerings such as select NFL and NBA games. And it represents a good value compared to popular alternatives because it combines video streaming with shopping perks and discounts for a relatively low price of $14.99 per month. It's a unique bundle, offering a distinct value to Amazon's customers. Netflix and Disney+ ad-free plans cost $15.99 and $13.99, respectively, and they don't come with Prime's shopping-related perks.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors also shouldn't forget about Amazon's foray into generative artificial intelligence (AI) -- a business that helped its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grow second-quarter sales by 13% to $9.3 billion and operating income by 38% year over year to $7.2 billion.\n\nWhile the AI industry is still hugely speculative, Amazon is protected from some of the uncertainty because of its focus on the infrastructure side of the industry with platforms like Bedrock, designed to help clients build customized AI algorithms using Amazon's foundational models.\n\nA reasonable valuation\n\nThere is a lot to like about Amazon, and the company's valuation is icing on the cake. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32, shares are slightly more expensive than the Nasdaq-10 average of 29. But this premium looks fair, considering the company's cost-cutting efforts and opportunities for future growth in video streaming and AI.\n\nOver the next three years, Amazon may enjoy significant bottom-line momentum. And its shares look set to outperform the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Cramer's Morning Thoughts: 20 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pinterest Inc. (NYSE:PINS) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer explains that if you're investing with real money, not just playing a simulation like a stock market game, it’s essential to open a real investment account. Reflecting on his own experience from 1979, he recalls that there were no online accounts back then. Since he already had some money in a Mellon Fund account through Fidelity, he decided to open his individual stock account with them as well.\n\nIn the early days of his investing journey, Cramer admits he didn’t have a clear source for stock ideas, so he turned to Forbes, a magazine he trusted. One article caught his eye about American Agronomics, a promising orange-growing company in Florida. It looked like a good opportunity, so he invested in 10 shares. Unfortunately, disaster struck when a frost destroyed the crops, slashing his investment in half. Cramer likens this experience to the storyline of the movie Trading Places. While the loss was painful, he emphasizes that it didn't crush his determination to keep learning and investing.\n\n\"At first, I didn’t know where to look for stock ideas, so I turned to a magazine I liked, Forbes. No offense to Forbes, but I read an interesting article about American Agronomics, a compelling orange grower in Florida. It seemed like a solid pick, so I bought 10 shares. Later, a frost hit, wiping out the crops and cutting my investment in half— a bit like the plot of Trading Places, if you’ve ever seen that classic Eddie Murphy movie. I was devastated but not defeated.\"\n\nJim Cramer's 1st Investment Lesson: Know What You Own\n\nJim Cramer shares a story about one of his early investing experiences. After suffering a loss on his previous investment, he sold off his remaining shares and used the leftover money to buy seven shares of Bobby Brooks, a clothing company recommended by Forbes. Unfortunately, the company reported poor financial results, and Cramer lost even more money. At the time, he had a stable job at American Lawyer magazine, earning $20,000 a year, and was living in a small, affordable studio apartment. This low cost of living allowed him to quickly rebuild his stock portfolio despite his earlier losses.\n\nDuring his work travels, Cramer once had a great breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and discovered the company was publicly traded. Intrigued, he returned to New York and went to the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, where he studied everything he could find about Bob Evans Farms and compared it with other companies in the same industry. Based on this research, he bought 20 shares of the company. His investment paid off when the stock rose after a strong financial quarter and a stock split. Through this experience, Cramer learned an important lesson: \"Know what you own.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"During my travels for work, I once had an amazing breakfast at Bob Evans Farms and learned that the company was publicly traded. When I returned to New York, I visited the Midtown Manhattan Public Library, read everything I could about Bob Evans, and compared it with other companies in the industry. Armed with that research, I bought 20 shares. The stock rose immediately following a good quarter and a stock split. That’s when I learned my first key investment lesson: know what you own.\"\n\nFrom Childhood Curiosity to Financial Empire: The Rise of Jim Cramer\n\nJim Cramer shared that his passion for stocks didn't ignite in adulthood after law school or college, or even in high school. It started much earlier, back in the fourth grade. According to him, his father would bring home the Philadelphia Bulletin, one of the largest newspapers in the country at the time. While most kids would eagerly flip to the comics or sports section, Jim was a huge Phillies fan, he found himself intrigued by something else. Curiosity got the best of him.\n\nThe business section of the paper, full of lists of names and numbers, looked like an indecipherable code compared to the baseball stats he regularly pored over. Terms like \"open,\" \"range,\" and \"close\" didn't make any sense to him, so he asked his dad, who had some experience dabbling in the stock market.\n\nHis dad encouraged him, and Jim began tracking stock names he heard on the radio, keeping a record of their daily performance in a ledger. For him, it became a fun game of prediction, much like analyzing baseball stats. He didn’t know much about the companies he was tracking, many were defense stocks that were performing well due to the Vietnam War, but it didn’t matter. The thrill of figuring out the next move kept him hooked.\n\nThe Stock Game\n\nNot long after, Jim introduced this \"stock game\" to his fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off his ledger and inviting his classmates to join in the fun. Though not everyone was interested, the lesson was clear: starting early can ignite a lifelong interest. For Cramer, this early exposure to the stock market became the foundation of his love for investing.\n\n\"Fast forward a bit, and I introduced this \"stock game\" to my fifth-grade class during show-and-tell, showing off my ledger and challenging my classmates to play. Not everyone was into it, but the lesson here is clear: get them started early. That’s how I fell in love with the stock market.\"\n\nJim Cramer's takeaway from his childhood stock obsession is simple: start young. The stock market is a long-term game, and the earlier you get involved, the higher your chances of winning will get.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article delves into Jim Cramer’s latest Morning Thoughts posts which list the top stocks Cramer's watching before the markets open. After going through his posts, we sorted the picks from his watchlist by hedge fund sentiment. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA young, stylish woman using her smartphone to find inspiration for her latest DIY project.\n\nPinterest Inc. (NYSE:PINS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 61\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) was given an \"outperform\" rating by Oppenheimer, with a $45 price target. Analysts see strong ad potential, particularly with integrations into platforms of other Investing Club names like\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMZN) and\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:GOOG). The latest Morning Thoughts post noted that this presents great growth opportunities for Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS).\n\n\"Pinterest was initiated at Oppenheimer with an outperform rating and $45 price target. The analysts see potential from ads, citing integrations with the platforms of Club names Amazon and Alphabet.\"\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) is an appealing investment option, supported by solid financial results and growing user engagement. In Q2 2024 earnings report, Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) announced revenue of $700 million, a 9% increase from the previous year, along with a net income of $80 million, indicating strong cost management and rising demand for its advertising services.\n\nThe platform also saw its monthly active users rise to 490 million, enhancing its attractiveness for advertisers looking to connect with potential customers. To further increase advertising revenue, Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) is improving its ad offerings with better targeting options and new ad formats that meet current marketing trends. Recently, Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) formed partnerships with major brands to expand shopping features, allowing users to buy products directly on the platform, which positions the company as a key player in social commerce.\n\nDespite challenges in the broader advertising market, Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)'s unique visual discovery platform gives it a competitive edge, making it a strong choice for brands aiming to engage consumers in innovative ways.\n\nAlger Mid Cap Focus Fund stated the following regarding Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) is a social media platform that enables users to search and shop products personalized to their taste, find ideas to do offline, and discover inspiring content. The platform has over 510 million global monthly active users, where over 95 million are in the U.S. We believe the company has the potential to benefit from strong product cycles due to enhanced ad stack improvements and platform optimizations.\n\nFurthermore, its recent partnership with Amazon.com allows Pinterest to tap into Amazon’s extensive merchant base. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal first quarter revenues and raised fiscal second quarter revenues higher than consensus estimates. The company noted that their ad stack improvements and lower-funnel product cycle (i.e., the later stages of a customer’s journey towards making a purchase) are helping to drive incremental spend from large advertisers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.\n\nAdditionally, management highlighted plans to introduce new AI driven tools designed to optimize content visibility and campaign efficacy, aiming to enhance conversion rates particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.”\n\nOverall PINS ranks 15th on our list of the stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PINS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PINS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "My Favorite \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Now (Hint: Nvidia's Not One)",
        "content": "\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks refers to a phrase coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the cohort leading the market. They are:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nTesla lagged behind the others this year due to a decreased demand for electric vehicles, but the other six have done quite well. However, a few of them have reached points where they are no longer attractive buys, leaving only a few that I'd buy right now.\n\nThere are four stocks I'm not interested in right now\n\nIf you don't have a generative artificial intelligence (AI) product, you don't belong in this group. Although Tesla isn't actively engaged in generative AI, its AI research is focused on full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which is another worthy endeavor, so I'll give it a pass.\n\nHowever, Apple was considerably late to the AI party and couldn't even get its Apple Intelligence product ready to go for the iPhone 16 launch. Couple that with the fact that Apple is extremely expensive (30 times forward earnings) with flattening revenue growth, and it quickly falls off the list of good buys.\n\nAs mentioned, the EV market is going through a downward demand wave, so I'm not interested in Tesla.\n\nBoth Nvidia and Microsoft are quite pricey, although they may still be good investments in their own right. However, they just don't have the value of Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is on the rise\n\nAmazon makes the list of stocks to buy because of its resurging cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although Amazon is expensive in its own right, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32 times, it has the potential to drastically decrease that price tag thanks to AWS.\n\nDespite accounting for 18% of Amazon's Q2 revenue, AWS accounted for 64% of its operating profit. This means that if AWS grows at a faster pace than the rest of Amazon's business, Amazon's profits will rise at a faster pace than revenue growth. Couple that with several profit-boosting initiatives, and Amazon's case to grow profits rapidly takes form.\n\nAs a result, I'm not concerned with Amazon's price tag, and it presents itself as a very attractive buy.\n\nAlphabet is much cheaper than the market\n\nAlphabet's investment case is fairly simple: It's cheap. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system has a healthy but growing ad business, which helps fund its other endeavors.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless its AI tools really take off, Alphabet's growth isn't going to be spectacular, but it will likely be consistently in the low double digits, which is enough to provide market-beating growth. Couple that with an improving operating margin and hefty stock buybacks, and you get a stock that can consistently grow earnings in the 20% range (it grew them by over 30% in Q2).\n\nDespite this, Alphabet's stock trades for 18.6 times forward earnings, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23 times forward earnings. Alphabet has the formula to steadily outperform the S&P 500, yet trades at a discount. This is a huge mismatch, and it makes the stock a screaming buy right now.\n\nMeta is rapidly growing profits and revenue\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms sneakily posted the second-highest year-over-year revenue growth of the group over the past year (behind Nvidia's incredible growth).\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta's business is driven by ads on its social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram. This allows Meta to fund its AI endeavors, buy back stock, and grow its dividend.\n\nBasically, Meta is doing the same thing as Alphabet -- but at a faster pace. GOOGL Normalized Basic EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAs a result, you'll pay a slightly higher premium for Meta's stock at 23.6 times forward earnings. But I think this is a worthy premium to pay, as Meta is currently executing at a high level.\n\nEven though the Magnificent Seven have had a strong 2024, there are still reasons to buy some of the group, and I suspect that their performance will continue to be strong moving forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of  AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Latest reports from The Information indicate that generative artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which is backed by Amazon, is in talks to raise new funding that would value the startup at up to $40 billion. Similar indications have recently been made about Anthropic rival OpenAI, which is also set to raise new funds in a round that would value the startup at over $100 billion. OpenAI is backed by Microsoft. In addition to Amazon, Anthropic is also backed by tech firms like Google and Salesforce.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has appointed Rohit Prasad, one of the chief minds behind the popular Alexa assistant, to spearhead an effort geared towards making the assistant more competitive in the AI space with the AI assistants of Amazon rivals in the tech world, per The Wall Street Journal. The report also claims that Amazon has placed thousands of people in a new team under Prasad to develop AI products for an Alexa upgrade and other businesses.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Costco's Latest Quarter Shows Its Business Model Continues To Work Beautifully\n\nOn Thursday, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) issued its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. While slightly coming short on revenue, the warehouse retailer’s earnings topped Wall Street estimates.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on September 1st, revenue rose just 1% YoY to $79.7 billion, slightly below Bloomberg’s estimate of $79.96 billion.\n\nMembership fee revenue ticked up slightly to $1.51 billion. Despite increasing 18.9 YoY, e-commerce sales came short of estimates as growth slowed down from the previous quarter when they exceeded 20% with growth of 20.7% to be exact. Same-store sales grew 5.3% in the U.S. and 5.5% in Canada.\n\nNet income grew 7% YoY to $2.35 billion with adjusted earnings being $5.29 per share, topping Bloomberg’ estimate of $5.07 per share. Strong customer engagement was reflected in a 6.4% rise in worldwide traffic.\n\nLike its rival, Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Costco is continuously working on enhancing the experience of its shoppers. Like Walmart, Costco is expanding its footprint. With a thriving business model. Both Walmart and Costco have been working on boosting e-commerce sales in attempt to rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), with e-commerce being a significant growth driver for all retailers. But despite efforts, Costco’s e-commerce sales growth slowed down. Yet, unlike Walmart, Costco has a special bonus, its subscriptions. It can even be said that what Costco really sells is its memberships as it makes most of its money from them.\n\nThe Impact Of The Membership Fee Hike Is Still Unknown\n\nThis was the first quarter since the warehouse retailer rose its membership fees. While the recent hike did not impact the reported period but going forward, it could drag down Costco’s results. On September 1st, Costco rose the price of its Gold Star membership by $5, and of its Executive membership by $10. This is the first time Costco raised its membership fees since 2017, impacting about 52 million memberships, with Executive memberships being a little over half of those. Therefore, Costco expects membership income growth in high single to low double digits. But as for the latest reported quarter, a small revenue miss was more than offset by strong profitability. Overall, Costco showed that while increasingly cautious, consumers are merely distributing as spend without running out of steam.\n\nUnlike Amazon that has a business empire across industries, spanning from e-commerce to the cloud, advertising, in addition to unlocking new opportunities to AI, Costco’s only business is retail. But, its business model is reliable and lucrative, and the latest quarter shows it is still working beautifully.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Microsoft: Cloud and AI Will Bring the Stock to New Highs",
        "content": "Microsoft has regularly outpaced the stock market, more than tripling over the past five years. The stock is a little less than 10% removed from its all-time high, but it won’t be like that for long. Microsoft Cloud and the company’s AI initiatives prompt me to be bullish on the stock. These two parts of Microsoft’s business can help the stock reach a new high.\n\nMicrosoft Is Gaining Ground On AWS\n\nTo begin with, Microsoft isn’t the only cloud giant in town, but it’s gaining ground on the largest cloud provider, warranting a bullish stance. Microsoft now has a 25% market share in the cloud computing industry. It’s an improvement that narrows the gap with Amazon (AMZN). AWS is currently the largest cloud platform and has 31% of the market. Alphabet (GOOGL) is in a distant third place, with 11% of the total market share.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft gained even more ground in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue grew by 21% year-over-year in Q4 FY24, while AWS revenue only increased by 19% year-over-year in Q2 2024. If Microsoft maintains an elevated growth rate compared to AWS, it can continue to gain market share.\n\nIn addition, more market share is good in any industry, but it’s even better in a growing industry. Artificial intelligence should result in more demand for cloud platforms. These platforms offer a pathway for many businesses to use generative AI. Microsoft also regularly updates its cloud platform with new AI features that help it stand out from the competition.\n\nMicrosoft Investors Get More Exposure to Cloud Computing\n\nThe unique angle with Microsoft compared to other tech giants in the cloud industry is that most of Microsoft’s revenue comes from cloud computing. That’s another reason for my bullishness since cloud computing is a promising industry.\n\nWhat’s important to note is that cloud revenue makes up less than 20% of total revenue for Amazon (as seen below in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool) and Alphabet. Investors in those stocks are getting limited exposure to cloud computing since the other components of those companies generate most of the revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft regularly pulls in more than half of its revenue from cloud computing – as seen in the TipRanks Revenue Breakdown tool below. The tech giant generated $64.7 billion in Q4 FY24, which was up by 15% year-over-year. Diving deeper into the numbers, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in the quarter, up by 21% year-over-year. That’s almost 60% of total revenue.\n\nMicrosoft Is Leading in Artificial Intelligence\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gave the company a head start in artificial intelligence, but the cloud platform isn’t the only AI catalyst. Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI and the release of Copilot are some of the reasons I’m bullish. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the Q4 FY24 results to emphasize Microsoft’s desire to ensure it is leading the AI era.\n\nAdditionally, while tech giants have been catching up, Microsoft has done a good job at incorporating AI across its offerings. For instance, you can find autogenerated suggestions underneath LinkedIn posts. Microsoft Copilot also helps boost productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks across Microsoft products. The tech giant also revealed Copilot for Security earlier this year, which makes cybersecurity more accessible to small businesses.\n\nAlthough Microsoft was always bound to cede some of its market share to rivals, the tech giant’s first-mover advantage suggests that it can maintain its current position. As the AI pie continues to grow, Microsoft should report elevated revenue and net income growth.\n\nIt’s Not Just AI and Cloud Computing\n\nWhile AI and cloud computing are the main reasons to be bullish about Microsoft, it also has other business segments that continue to perform well. For instance, LinkedIn delivered 10% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. The social network has become a top resource for business professionals who want to grow their careers and build their networks.\n\nFurthermore, Microsoft delivered 19% year-over-year revenue growth for search and news advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs. Microsoft also fortified its position in the gaming industry with its Activision Blizzard acquisition. As a result, Xbox revenue jumped by 61% year-over-year, with Activision Blizzard contributing 58 percentage points to the growth rate.\n\nOverall, Microsoft’s well-diversified business is hard to find among other publicly traded corporations. In addition, the company’s investments in artificial intelligence can help the company discover more growth opportunities with these parts of the business.\n\nIs Microsoft a Buy or Sell Right Now?\n\nMicrosoft is currently rated as a Strong Buy by 30 analysts, with 28 Buys and 2 Holds.

        "content": "Amazon’s partnership with AI firm Anthropic does not qualify for further investigation over concerns about impacting competition in the AI sector, the UK’s competition regulator has said.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its initial Phase 1 investigation into whether Amazon’s four billion dollar investment and other arrangements with Anthropic created a merger situation that could impact competition in the sector.\n\nThe watchdog has been vocal about its concerns around large tech firms investing heavily in AI start-ups and earlier this year highlighted a number of what it called an “interconnected web” of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments between a small handful of the biggest tech and AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector.\n\nIt has since launched a number of investigations into similar partnerships.\n\nIn this case, the CMA said that it tested Amazon’s arrangements with Anthropic against thresholds for turnover and share of supply, concluding that neither was met, and therefore a further investigation will not be pursued.\n\nWriting on LinkedIn, Joel Bamford, executive director of mergers at the CMA, said: “Reviews like this help us to gain more clarity around whether they could fall under UK merger rules and any subsequent impact they could have on competition, and we hope that this clarity also benefits businesses with an interest in these markets.\n\n“Our investigation into Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic found that that Amazon’s four billion dollar investment into Anthropic allowed it to enter multiple non-exclusive arrangements with Anthropic and secure certain rights in connection with its investment.\n\n“Having tested these arrangements against the UK merger control jurisdiction thresholds for turnover and share of supply, we have concluded that they are not met. We also considered whether the arrangements allowed Amazon to exercise material influence over Anthropic.\n\n“Ultimately, given neither of the required turnover or share of supply tests were met, we did not need to reach a conclusion on material influence.\n\n“As a result, we do not believe that a relevant merger situation has been created and will not refer this for further investigation.”\n\nSeparate investigations into partnerships between Google and Anthropic and Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI remain ongoing, the CMA confirmed.",

        "content": "Microsoft, Google, Meta Pave Path to AI Expansion, Nvidia and Broadcom Set to Reap Benefits\n\nThe quarterly performance of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) adequately reflects that the artificial intelligence wave is in no mood to slow down in the near term.\n\nHyperscalers, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) remain aggressively invested in their artificial intelligence ambitions. The U.S. and China’s key rate cuts also added an additional tailwind for the capital-intensive industry.\n\nMicrosoft committed 14.7 billion Reais ($2.70 billion) over three years to Brazil’s cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to a Reuters report.\n\nAlso Read: Micron’s AI-Driven HBM Demand and Data Center Growth to Fuel Stock Upside, Analysts Say\n\nThe company’s ConectAI program will train 5 million people with AI skills over the next three years. Microsoft already has two Azure regions: one in São Paulo state, which it launched in 2014, and another in Rio de Janeiro, which it launched in 2020.\n\nEarlier this week, Microsoft earmarked $1.3 billion over the next three years to drive Mexico’s AI infrastructure and initiatives, including training 5 million people. Microsoft also collaborated with BlackRock, Inc (NYSE:BLK) and other partners, forging a fresh $30 billion investment fund to tap the AI wave.\n\nGoogle is eyeing a $3.3 billion investment in South Carolina to build two new data centers. The search engine giant’s plans included two new data center campuses in Dorchester County and expanding its existing data center campus in Berkeley County, Reuters cites the South Carolina governor’s office as saying.\n\nAlphabet committed $2 billion to the Dorchester County facilities, potentially creating 200 new operational jobs. According to Reuters, the company also earmarked $1.3 billion for Berkeley County.\n\nAnother positive update for the industry is the report indicating struggling chipmaker Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) and the U.S. government are trying to finalize the $8.5 billion in direct funding for the chipmaker before the end of the year.\n\nTherefore, Intel’s exploration of stake sales to companies like Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) could also disrupt its chances of bagging the subsidy over antitrust grounds. Intel had already faced Senator scrutiny over its cost-cutting measures as the subsidy aims to create additional U.S. jobs.\n\nSemiconductor ETFs VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) gained 5%-6% in the last 5 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock is up 1.21% to $24.21 premarket at last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMeta Analysts Highlight AI, VR Advances, See Growth Pushing It Toward Apple-Like Valuation\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nAdvances in AI could trigger unwelcome outcomes for investors in the future.\n\nAs AI advances speed up markets and also create more complex trading models, a lot of stocks may become overcrowded in the search for alpha — and at risk for swift downdrafts if information changes, warns Tradeweb Markets (TW) CEO Billy Hult.\n\n\"It's something [we have] to think through,\" Hult told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nCrowded trades occur when similar investment strategies — usually fueled by complex trading models —send investors all into the same stocks. Shares of the overcrowded stocks tend to rise as the bulls rush in with reckless abandon, and little attention is paid to a company's valuation.\n\nLiquidity shortages, spikes in volatility, and short squeezes are some risks that come with crowded trades.\n\nThe other risk is that the stocks could get hammered significantly if information changes, sending everyone headed for the exit all at once.\n\nThe latest example: the swift sell-off in markets in early August.\n\nBank of America strategists said in a report at the time that “crowding risk mattered,” and it saw “the least crowded stocks outperforming the most crowded by eight percentage points.”\n\nThe Magnificent 7 tech stocks rose again in popularity this summer, as AI chips powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) enjoyed a brief stay as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nPros like Hult argue this type of crowding into top-performing stocks will only worsen as AI makes markets more sophisticated.\n\nProponents of AI envision, however, a world where traders are better informed through deeper insight gathered from a variety of sources.\n\n“I think we’re going to continue to see data driven execution in fixed income trading. And we're going to continue to see machine learning get applied to, sort of how the search for liquidity occurs in fixed income,” said Hult. “The next level of technology is going to be more sophisticated.”\n\nHult is a longtime evangelist of integrating finance, investment vehicles, and revolutionary technology. As a builder of electronic marketplaces, Tradeweb has worked with firms that seek to unite investors and machines. But it also stays true to the need for softer people skills.\n\n“[Tradeweb] has lived and breathed in the ethos of the market for a long time,” Hult said. “We really value the personal relationship side of the business.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best NASDAQ Stock to Invest In Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\n\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\n\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ’s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\n\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\n\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\n\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\n\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\n\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company that deals in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming. It is the best NASDAQ stock to invest in right now with sales soaring, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and accelerated growth in the company’s AWS division. Moreover, according to Insider Monkey, 308 hedge funds had investments in the tech giant as of Q2 2024, with the highest stake held by Fisher Asset Management, valued at $8.4 billion.\n\nDuring Q2, the company's revenue was worth $148 billion, registering an 11% increase year-over-year. Operating income surged 91% from the same period last year to a total of $14.7 billion. Revenue for AWS was recorded at $26.3 billion, up 18.8%. The segment now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $105 billion. Advertising revenue for the quarter also crossed the $2 billion mark, contributing to the more than $50 billion advertising revenue earned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the last 12 months. Store sales grew 9% in North America and 10% in the international markets, fueled by fast delivery and lower prices.\n\nThe company has also been spending heavily on capital expenditure and incurred $30.5 billion in capital investments during the first half of 2024. The management expects the figure to be higher during the second half of the year, mainly driven by the need for AWS infrastructure as demand surges for both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. Amazon’s leadership is bullish about the long-term impact of artificial intelligence on the business.\n\nInvestors also remain confident about the company’s trajectory, especially given the strong performance of AWS, where backlog increased 19% year-over-year to reach a staggering $156.6 billion at the end of Q2, indicating strong future demand. The segment’s profitability is also improving and has jumped from the mid-20% range last year to over 30% this year due to strategic decisions made over the past year to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nFounded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2023, Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence management would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\n\nThe only bearish concern at this point is around the fluctuating operating margins of AWS. However, one reason behind that is the investments Amazon is making to improve efficiency and in building new products. The overall outlook for the company is positive. There is consensus among Street analysts on the stock’s Strong Buy rating with forecasts of a 16% upside in its share price.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Dow Tops 42,000: 3 Magnificent Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is having a record year. The widely followed index broke the 40,000 mark in May for the first time. This week, the Dow topped 42,000 -- again setting an all-time high.\n\nShould investors check out some of the top components of the Dow Jones index? I think so. Here are three magnificent Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is handily beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant have soared 27%, compared to an 11% gain for the Dow. I think Amazon still has plenty of room to run.\n\nThe company has proven it can successfully adapt to changing environments. For example, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andy Jassy noted in Amazon's second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 1, 2024, that customers \"continue to trade down on price when they can.\" Weeks later, Amazon launched its new Amazon Saver private label that offers low-cost grocery items, with most priced below $5.\n\nI expect Amazon will continue to lower the costs of its e-commerce business and boost profitability with technological innovations, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The company's technological prowess should also help it improve customer service and speed delivery.\n\nHowever, Amazon's biggest growth opportunity could be in helping other organizations implement AI. Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the leader in the cloud services market. It offers a wide range of tools to make deploying AI models easier and faster. AI adoption should accelerate the migration to the cloud -- and AWS is poised to be a key beneficiary.\n\n2. The Home Depot\n\nThe Home Depot's (NYSE: HD) year-to-date gain of 14% looks quite good, considering its lackluster financial results. The home improvement retailer reported a meager year-over-year revenue gain in Q2 that would have been a decline if not for the acquisition of SRS Distribution. Home Depot's earnings also slipped from the prior-year period.\n\nWhat's weighing on The Home Depot? CEO Ted Decker diagnosed the problem in his Q2 earnings call remarks: \"[H]igher interest rates and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured consumer demand more broadly.\" As a result, consumers spent less on home improvement projects.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve is now riding to the rescue. The Fed announced a 0.5% reduction in interest rates, with more cuts likely on the way over the next few months. This should provide a spark for the homebuilding and home improvement markets.\n\nMore importantly, the long-term prospects for The Home Depot are strong. The median age of homes in the U.S. is over 40 years old. You can bet that the demand in the home improvement market will be healthy for a long time to come. With a 17% market share, The Home Depot should reward investors for a long time to come, too.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Verizon Communications\n\nVerizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) is another major contributor to the Dow's record-setting performance in 2024. Shares of the telecommunications leader have jumped nearly 19%.\n\nSure, Verizon's revenue growth isn't anything to write home about. In Q2, total revenue increased by only 0.6% year over year. However, the company appears to be on the right track, with new services giving more choices to businesses and consumers.\n\nThe main draw for Verizon is its dividend program. Verizon's forward dividend yield tops 6%. The company has increased its dividend for 18 consecutive years, and I expect that impressive streak to continue.\n\nI also think Verizon's future could be brighter than its recent past. The company is already reaping the rewards from its investment in AI to improve operations. To that end, 6G networks, which will support lots of new capabilities for wireless users, could also provide a significant tailwind for Verizon by the end of the decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Why Are Billionaires Bullish on This Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\n\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don’t waste time with underperformers—they target the market's elite.\n\nThe Stock Market Rally\n\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%–5.00% from 5.25%–5.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024—the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\n“Right now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we’re on our way back to 2%. So I don’t think you’re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.”\n\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed’s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\n\nWhat the Top Dogs of Wall Street are Saying About the Market\n\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\n\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world’s leading hedge funds and companies.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 33\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a tech giant specializing in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and cloud services. The company is also advancing in the AI space, partnering with startups like Anthropic and securing deals with the U.S. government to test new AI models.\n\nEvercore ISI recently raised its price target for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares from $225 to $240, maintaining an Outperform rating. This new target is based on a 35x multiple of projected 2026 earnings per share of around $7.00 and a 25x multiple of expected 2026 free cash flow of approximately $100 billion. The tech giant is focusing on monetizing its content through advertising, with CEO Andy Jassy highlighting the ad business, now at a $50 billion revenue run rate, during the Q2 earnings call—second only to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Evercore ISI also estimates Amazon Prime Video (APV) could contribute $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion in operating income by 2025, potentially boosting total 2024 operating income by 3% to 5%.\n\nAs of the second quarter of 2024, 33 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes in Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe that there are under-the-radar AI stocks trading at highly discounted valuations that hold greater promise for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "China’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t",
        "content": "Wall Street mega investors have recently made Chinese stocks their home for billions, especially as the government takes new stimulus measures. Cutting rates places stocks like Alibaba and Baidu in a much better position than their peers, Amazon and Google. Wall Street analysts agree with this setup, placing double-digit upside potential in these stocks for the coming quarters.\n\nEven though the Chinese stock market has been scrutinized extensively in the past couple of years, some investors have begun to realize that there is much more upside than apparent risk for Asia’s powerhouse. China’s technology sector has the lowest valuation in history compared to its American counterpart.\n\nMeasured through the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (NYSE:KWEB), names in this space now trade at steep discounts against peers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and even Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). While discounted stocks might not look attractive to some investors based on their price action, others recognize the value to be had in them.\n\nThis is why stocks like Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and the overall iShares MSCI China ETF have delivered shareholders a significant rally this week, one of the best performances since the few months after the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail investors can also feel a bit safer because some of Wall Street’s favorite investors have also given these companies a chance to make billions.\n\nChinese Government Interventions Improve the Risk-Reward Balance for Investors\n\nRecently, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) in the United States decided to lower interest rates by half a percent, or 50 basis points. The Chinese economy has been criticized long enough for its slowdown and contractions, so the government has also decided to cut rates by the same amount.\n\nThe difference is that the Chinese ETF trades at only 47% of the high prices it made in early 2021, while the technology-focused NASDAQ 100 index trades at 96% of its 52-week high now. This means that the potential reward is much bigger in China than the pullback the U.S. technology space could make after these runs.\n\nStanley Druckenmiller decided to sell out of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after realizing the potential upside was no longer that attractive; it is no surprise to see his former mentor and boss George Soros initiate a $73.4 million position in Alibaba.\n\nAs lower rates start to spread through the Chinese economy, the consumer discretionary sector and rate-dependent technology companies will probably see the benefits first, so they have become the top choice for other mega investors as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWho’s Buying Chinese Stocks Now and What They’re Adding to Their Portfolios\n\nSome investors would recognize him for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, but Michael Burry has now made Alibaba his top holding. After buying it for the better part of 2024, Burry’s portfolio is now reported to hold up to 155,000 shares valued at roughly $14.8 million today.\n\nThe trend doesn’t end there for Burry, as he also chose Baidu as his fourth-largest position, with 75,000 shares valued at approximately $9 million. Coming right after Baidu, Burry chose JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to be his fifth-largest position, with 250,000 shares carrying a value of $8.3 million today.\n\nThose names are the common choice among investors today. David Tepper has recently deviated from his typical picks in the financial and technology sector to pick on Chinese stocks. For Tepper, his fund bought up to 10,500,000 shares for an approximate value of just over $1 billion in the portfolio.\n\nConsidering that Alibaba trades at less than a third of the $316 a share high it made after COVID-19, it makes sense for these investors to look at the potential risk-to-reward ratios and decide if it is worth taking a risk on Chinese stocks.\n\nWall Street’s Latest Take on Alibaba and Baidu: Key Insights for Investors\n\nStarting with Alibaba, analysts now justify a consensus price target of $107.6 a share on the stock, calling for 12.7% upside from where it trades today. However, those at Susquehanna decided to go above and beyond the consensus and place a $130 valuation on Alibaba, implying it could run by a much bigger 35.4% from today’s price.\n\nWhen it comes to Baidu, the stock trades at only 68% of its 52-week high to offer enough potential upside to consider it. This is why analysts at Citigroup see a potential case for the stock to trade as high as $155 a share, daring the stock to stage a massive 64.8% rally from where it has traded down to today.\n\nHere are other insights for investors to consider: Alibaba’s main competitor could be assumed to be Amazon, which is why the Chinese giant’s 25.1x P/E ratio means a significant discount to Amazon’s 46.0x valuation today. For Baidu, competition can only arguably be found in shares of Google.\n\nBaidu’s 12.4x P/E valuation would also offer investors a steep discount compared to Google’s valuation of 23.3x P/E today, despite a recent selloff in that stock. When it comes to upside and diminished risk, investors all over are finding Chinese stocks to be the winners; maybe retail investors should, too.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina’s Tech Stocks Surge: What Top Investors Know That You Don’t\n\nWhy Small-Cap Stocks Could Be Ready to Outperform After Rate Cuts\n\nHealthcare Stocks Poised to Shine?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Arm Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) approached Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). to explore the possibility of acquiring its struggling product division, but Intel responded that the unit was not up for sale, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe source, who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the discussions, said that Arm was not interested in Intel’s manufacturing operations.\n\nIntel is split into two key divisions: a product group that develops chips for PCs, servers, and networking equipment, and a second division that manages its factories.\n\nOnce the world’s leading chipmaker, Intel has faced takeover speculation following a sharp decline in its business performance this year.\n\nThe company recently reported disappointing earnings, resulting in the steepest decline in its share price in decades.\n\nAlong with cutting 15,000 jobs to reduce costs, scaling back factory expansion, and suspending its long-standing dividend.\n\nAs part of its restructuring efforts, Intel is separating its chip product division from its manufacturing operations.\n\nThis move is designed to attract external customers and investors, but it also paves the way for a potential company split, according to a Bloomberg report from last month.\n\nArm, majority-owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984), generates most of its revenue from licensing chip designs for smartphones.\n\nHowever, CEO Rene Haas has been working to expand Arm's presence beyond that market, particularly in the PC and server sectors, where it competes directly with Intel.\n\nAlthough Intel has lost some of its technological advantage, it still dominates these markets.\n\nA potential partnership with Intel would expand Arm’s market reach and boost its move toward selling more complete products.\n\nCurrently, Arm licenses its designs to other companies, which then build the final components. Arm's clients include major technology companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Samsung (KS:005930).\n\nUnder Haas's leadership, Arm has been shifting toward offering more fully developed products, which could bring it into competition with its current licensees.\n\nDespite its smaller size, Arm's market value has surged following its IPO last year, reaching over $156 billion.\n\nInvestors view the company as a key player in the growing AI market, especially as it increases its focus on data center chips. With an 88% stake owned by SoftBank, Arm also has considerable financial backing, the report said.\n\nIn contrast, Intel has seen its market capitalization fall by more than half this year, now standing at $102.3 billion. Still, Intel has other options.\n\nStory continues\n\nApollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc. recently offered to invest up to $5 billion in the company, signaling support for CEO Pat Gelsinger, the report said.\n\nAdditionally, Intel is planning to sell part of its stake in Altera Corp., a semiconductor firm it bought in 2015, to private equity investors.\n\nIntel separated Altera from its operations last year with plans to take it public. Recent speculation about a Qualcomm acquisition has also provided a boost to Intel’s stock price, the report added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel rejected Arm's approach to buy product unit- report\n\nBBVA, KKR form climate-focused strategic partnership\n\nTaiwan stocks higher at close of trade; Taiwan Weighted up 0.43%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\n\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\n\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Deidre Bosa, a reporter for news platform CNBC, recently claimed that Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic is on track to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, up 1,000% year-on-year. The increase in revenue represents the explosive growth opportunity in AI, a tech trend that started gaining widespread traction in 2023. Bosa claims that despite the revenue jump, the gross margin of the firm is thinner than a high-quality firm, coming in at only 38%, but that likely has to do with higher upfront costs in developing AI models.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Amazon has exceeded its goal of attracting $1.8 billion in ad-spending commitments on its video-streaming services for next year, The Information reported on Thursday citing a person with direct knowledge of the company's ad sales efforts.\n\nAdvertisers negotiate large TV and streaming ad commitments for the coming 12 months in the upfront ad market, which recently concluded for 2024.\n\nThe spending commitments include ads on Prime Video and Amazon's live sports telecasts, such as the National Football League's Thursday Night Football games, the report said.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is betting it can keep its ad revenue growth going by investing in streaming TV and capturing a meaningful share of ad budgets, especially as they increasingly shift toward streaming-video services.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.\n\nThe company began placing ads on its Prime Video offering for the first time earlier this year.\n\nIn July, Amazon, along with Walt Disney's ESPN and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal clinched the rights to carry National Basketball Association games in an 11-year deal valued at $77 billion.\n\nThe NBA adds to Prime Video's growing roster of live sports offerings, which include NFL and NASCAR in 2025.\n\nAmazon missed estimates for advertising sales, a closely watched metric, in the second quarter, as it ramps up its rivalry with Meta Platform and Alphabet's Google. Sales of $12.8 billion were below average estimates of $13 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)",

        "content": "News of China's economic stimulus has given Chinese equities a spike this week with Alibaba BABA starting to turn heads again.\n\nAlibaba’s stock has catapulted +14% this month with BABA now sitting on +30% gains for the year to top American e-commerce giant Amazon's AMZN+25%.\n\nSeeing as Alibaba and Amazon shares have had nice momentum in September, it's certainly a worthy topic of which e-commerce stock may be the better buy. To that point, its notable that their Zacks Internet-Commerce Industry is currently in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks industries. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Investors Favor Amazon\n\nDiving into the outlook for these retail leaders, Amazon’s growth trajectory is more compelling with annual earnings now expected to climb 63% in fiscal 2024 to $4.74 per share versus EPS of $2.90 in FY23. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to pop another 23%.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has largely attributed to the tech behemoths' expansion as Amazon's total sales are forecasted to increase more than 10% in FY24 and FY25 with projections edging toward $700 billion. As the world’s largest cloud provider, Amazon’s AWS segment sales increased 18% during Q2 to $26.28 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlibaba has diverse operations outside of its e-commerce business as well which also includes cloud computing but the company’s earnings growth has slowed in recent years.\n\nAlready in its FY25, Alibaba’s EPS is expected to be up roughly 1% in its current fiscal year and is slated to be virtually flat in FY26 with projections at $8.74 per share. However, Alibaba’s top line is projected to expand 7% in FY25 and FY26 with forecasts edging toward $150 billion in annual sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValue Investors Favor Alibaba\n\nDespite Amazon's more attractive growth trajectory, value investors may be more drawn to Alibaba’s stock. Amid the recent rally BABA still trades at just 10.9X forward earnings and at a significant discount to the industry average of 28.7X.\n\nIn contrast, AMZN is at a 40.5X forward earnings multiple which is also a noticeable premium to the S&P 500’s 24.2X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFurthermore, BABA trades at less than 2X sales with AMZN at 3.1X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBalance Sheet Comparison\n\nRegarding the balance sheet, Amazon had $89 billion in cash & equivalents at the end of Q2 2024 compared to Alibaba’s $68 billion.\n\nAmazon’s total assets stood at $554.81 billion with $318.37 billion in total liabilities.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEqually as impressive, Alibaba has $245.63 billion in total assets compared to $102.18 billion in total liabilities. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Alibaba and Amazon’s stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It’s easy to see how growth investors may favor Amazon while value investors may be more inclined to choose Alibaba’s stock. Still, there could be better buying opportunities ahead after the recent surge in these e-com stocks although they remain viable long-term investments.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra and Arpan Chaturvedi\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A former top Amazon seller in India has asked a judge to quash an antitrust investigation that found the U.S. e-commerce company and some of its sellers breached local competition laws, court records showed on Thursday.\n\nAntitrust investigations conducted by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) have found Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, some of their sellers and smartphone brands, violated local competition laws by giving preference to select online sellers and prioritizing certain listings, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe findings follow a Reuters investigation in 2021 which was based on Amazon's internal documents and showed the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers on its platform, and used them to bypass Indian laws. Amazon denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOne of those sellers, Appario, which has since ceased to be a seller on Amazon, on Thursday challenged the CCI in the High Court in Karnataka state, saying the investigation report that names it must be \"set aside\", court records showed.\n\nNo further information on the grounds for the suit was immediately available.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the first legal challenge to the CCI investigation that started in 2020, and poses a major challenge to Amazon in India, a key market.\n\nAppario also said in the suit that a CCI order that asked it to submit its financial statements after the investigation was completed should be quashed, according to the court's records.\n\nAppario, Amazon and the competition regulator did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon maintained it does not give preferential treatment to any seller and complies with all laws, but said in October 2022 that Appario will within a year cease to list products on its website.\n\nThe Reuters investigation had found that Appario was internally referred to as a \"special\" merchant and received discounted fees and access to Amazon global retail tools used for things like inventory management.\n\nIn 2022, the CCI raided Appario and some other sellers as part of its investigations.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

        "title": "Target CEO hopes the company will eventually remove locked cases as it combats retail theft",
        "content": "Target (TGT) is trying to thread the needle as it combat retail's long-running problem: store theft.\n\n\"I feel so much better today than I did a year ago,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with Yahoo Finance for its Lead This Way series. \"It comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level, and at the local level.\"\n\nThe federal INFORM Consumers Act, which took effect in June of 2023, helps deter theft by making it more difficult to resell stolen goods online. Under the legislation, companies with \"high-volume third-party marketplaces\" like Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) must \"collect, verify, and disclose certain information about those sellers.\" Any violations will result in a penalty of $50,120 per infraction.\n\nThe legislation is \"starting to crack down on some of the marketplace abuses that were out there,\" said Cornell. He also noted he's \"seeing some actions\" in state legislation, particularly in California.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed 10 bills to crack down on theft, including stricter penalties for retail theft and anyone involved in organized retail crime. There are also new penalties for \"smash-and-grabs,\" or \"flash robs\" like the one seen at a Nordstorm (JWN) last year that resulted in the loss of roughly $300,000 in merchandise.\n\nAn ultimate fix won't happen overnight; \"It's going to take several years. We're trying to make sure we can control what we can control,\" Cornell said.\n\nIn its second quarter report, Target's gross margin rate reflected roughly 90 basis points \"of benefit from lower inventory shrink.\" That's compared to a 20-basis-point lift in Q1. Its guidance assumes that benefit will increase year over year.\n\n\"We're expecting shrink costs will be approximately flat to last year. While it's encouraging to see this progress, we'll continue our work to move shrink rates down to more sustainable levels in the years ahead, given the steep increase in shrink that our business has absorbed over the last five years,\" CFO Michael Fiddelke said on a call with investors. Target CEO Brian Cornell on locked cases.\n\nPart of the strategy to combat the issue included closing nine underperforming stores at the end of last October. At some hard-hit stores, Target introduced locked cases for \"prone-to-theft\" items, including soap, shampoo, razors, and even socks and underwear.\n\n\"To be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open. We want to make sure they're safe,\" said Cornell.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile waiting for store associates to unlock merchandise may be inconvenient, it's a necessary nuisance, David Johnston of the National Retail Federation told Yahoo Finance last year.\n\n\"Think of the opposite when the mother of a newborn tries to go get formula and the merchandise isn't there because it was just shelf-swept,\" he said.\n\nCornell said he \"certainly [hopes]\" that Target will remove the cases one day, reiterating the company is waiting for the results of federal, state, and local government's involvement. Target puts socks, underwear behind locked cases to prevent theft. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nInstituting the right self-checkout process will also help the matter; Cornell said it has been a matter of trial and error.\n\nThe company expanded its self-checkout during the pandemic to allow big baskets, but has since cut back to 10 items only.\n\n\"We're getting back to the way self-checkout should have been used. More team members running service-belted lanes, self-checkouts there for smaller baskets, 10 items or less. It's the right balance and we get better interaction\" with guests, said Cornell.\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nWhole Foods CEO Jason Buechel wants to put an end to the grocer's \"whole paycheck\" moniker.\n\nJust hearing those two words is aggravating, Buechel said.\n\n“We’ve been doing so much work on trying to bring down our prices,” he explained to Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi during a conversation for Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above).\n\nWhole Foods has doubled its number of promotions compared to last year and reduced prices on 25% of its items, including 880 products under its private label 365.\n\n“Customers are noticing those changes,” he said. “We’re starting to see folks build up bigger baskets in those areas.”\n\nThe move is timely.\n\nSupermarket rivals such as Target (TGT) have recently slashed prices to lure in inflation-weary shoppers. Cutting prices should keep Whole Foods competitive in traffic-driving categories like milk, bread, and canned goods.\n\nSecondarily, lower prices could set Whole Foods apart in what is still an inflationary backdrop for food items.\n\nConsumer Price Index data revealed that in August, food and grocery prices rose nearly 0.1% compared to July. Gains were seen in meat, poultry, fish, and eggs.\n\nConsumers spent roughly 0.5% more on dairy-related items in August too.\n\n“We want to make sure that we can meet customers where they’re at right now,” Buechel said, adding that consumers “have felt that pinch on inflation across the board, not just in food prices, but in their bills and everything else.”\n\nWhole Foods is also aiming to keep the integrity of its products as it reduces prices.\n\nThe chain's longtime policies, such as not carrying goods with banned ingredients and enacting standards around animal welfare, seafood sustainability, and cage-free eggs, have remained.\n\n“At the same time, we’re helping protect our food systems; we’re also providing healthier food,” Buechel said. “We want to be in a place where we can offer the highest quality natural and organic foods at great prices.”\n\nTo be sure, the Amazon-owned chain has come a long way from its beginnings as a natural foods grocer serving health nuts bopping about Austin, Texas, in 1980.\n\nIts portfolio now boasts 517 physical stores in the US, 14 in Canada, and five in the United Kingdom.\n\nBuechel says the chain is ramping up new store openings over the next 12 months, especially in the New York area.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 9.7% over the last month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Amazon.com's  ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n19% = US$44b ÷ US$236b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nAmazon.com's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\n\nAt first glance, Amazon.com seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 21%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nNext, on comparing Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 15% over the last few years. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Amazon's AI strategy is set to deliver a chip advantage: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAt the start of the new year, Amazon (AMZN) employees will be required to work from their offices five days a week, tightening a rule that allowed some work from home in a bid to revitalize company culture — and realize CEO Andy Jassy’s broader shift toward restructuring and belt-tightening.\n\nThe successor to Amazon’s long-reigning CEO, Jeff Bezos, sees it as a top priority to strengthen internal culture.\n\n“We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” he wrote in a memo to employees earlier this month. For years he has worked to improve on the Everything Store’s cost structure and operating margins. And on top of operations, the company faces other challenges, from upstart discount retailers to the nagging perception that it’s behind in the AI arms race.\n\nBut that last hurdle may have already been cleared.\n\nAnalysts say that Amazon’s cloud business, AWS, has invested heavily enough in catching up to the industry’s first mover, Microsoft (MSFT), that its position may even be advantageous. Amazon’s ability to deploy its own chips within its data centers — at a fraction of the cost of relying on Nvidia’s — is the key.\n\nAmazon, some analysts contend, has a leg up on its competitors on two fronts: first, over Microsoft, which was hit with a rare downgrade earlier this week for leaning too heavily on Nvidia's (NVDA) AI infrastructure. Or as Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance, “Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.” Andy Jassy on stage at the 2022 New York Times DealBook on Nov. 30, 2022, in New York City. (Thos Robinson/Getty Images for The New York Times) (Thos Robinson via Getty Images)\n\nJassy also seems to have an answer to recent grumblings over returns on investment as tech giants dedicate tens of billions of dollars to AI capital expenditures. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\n\nOf course, it’s still too early to say if something like “AI chip sovereignty,” the fancy word for vertical integration, will be a key factor in monetizing AI tools or if unseating Nvidia in the battle over chips will be all that useful. Amazon is taking a more “all are welcome” marketplace approach to large language models, offering customers an array of advanced models to choose from instead of peddling a single proprietary offering.\n\nSome on Wall Street see another short-term advantage over a different rival: Google. Pinched by the potential threat of ChatGPT disrupting a search-based business model, as well as ramped-up antitrust enforcement over search practices, Google carries near-term risks that make Amazon look more attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's stock is up close to 30% this year. Among its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" only Nvidia's staggering rise and Meta's (META) turnaround have outperformed.\n\nThe company is reportedly unveiling a new Alexa with AI as early as next month. Another positive jolt to Amazon's AI story might be the most powerful cultural shift there is.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "To unpack the 40-year-plus leadership journey of Target (TGT) chairman and CEO Brian Cornell, you have to head to the fenced-off basketball courts in the Whitestone neighborhood of Queens, N.Y.\n\nThe area wasn't always a magnet for upper-middle-income families, and Cornell wasn't always decked out in a fitted white button-down, dark slim-cut jeans, and black leather loafers.\n\n\"I grew up largely without a dad,\" Cornell, 65, told me in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Lead This Way. \"I had the support of my mom and tremendous support from my grandparents, who actually lived in this neighborhood. It certainly wasn't a classic lifestyle where we say, 'All right, here's a kid who's going to grow up to be successful.' Certainly not run a company like Target. But I learned early on in life the importance of school and performing well in the classroom.\"\n\nBack then, he was just a sports-loving kid who shoveled snow, mowed lawns, and washed trucks to buy sporting equipment — a world away from high-profile jobs at PepsiCo (PEP), Walmart (WMT) owned Sam's Club, Michael's, and Safeway.\n\n\"I think if you grow up the way I did, you always feel like the underdog. You always worry about taking that step back,\" added Cornell. \"So I think it has always given me a bit of a competitive edge, and you kind of lean in and make sure that nobody's going to ever outwork you and you're going to give it your all and try to perform every day.\" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell (left) returns to his hometown basketball courts in Queens, N.Y., for the first time in decades to share with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (right) how he rose the leadership ranks. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nCornell has taken that mentality and transformed Target into a modern-day big box chain, which features stationery and groceries alongside limited-edition Stanley tumblers and hand lotion from Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\n\nIt hasn't been an easy decade for Cornell, who likes to quote teachings by famed UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. But the chief executive is used to breaking through roadblocks, whether it be scrimping each week in Queens or leading an iconic retailer from a home base in Minneapolis.\n\nCornell's major CEO moments\n\nA CEO's tenure is often defined by a few key moments. The right decisions tend to lead to impressive sales, profit gains, and, if the company is public, a higher stock price. The wrong moves will likely ensure a brief stay in the corner office.\n\nCornell has stood at many crossroads at Target — including on his first official day on Aug. 12, 2014.\n\nAs the first outsider to lead Target as CEO, Cornell came into a retailer often missing the mark. The company had been taking on heat from a data breach that impacted an estimated 70 million debit and credit cards. And prior management's dreadful foray into Canada was hemorrhaging money.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween Jan. 1, 2014 and July 30, Target's stock fell 3.4% compared to a 6.6% gain on the S&P 500 (^GSPC), per Yahoo Finance data.\n\nTarget went on to post a meager 1.3% same-store sales gain for 2014 and a 2.7% drop in adjusted earnings per share, its second straight year of declines.\n\nIt was time to act fast.\n\nIn early January 2015, Cornell announced the closure of 133 stores in Canada, less than two years after it opened its first location in the country. The company incurred a $5.4 billion quarterly loss and laid off 17,000 workers.\n\n\"I was new to the company, new to the board, and I never expected that I'd be talking about closing down that operation. I thought it'll be just something that I focus in on for a couple years. We turn that around, we'd get Target back on track in Canada,\" Cornell recalled.\n\nBut he doesn't regret making the tough call.\n\nBy December 2015, Cornell was back with a $1.9 billion deal to sell Target's 1,600-store-plus pharmacy business to CVS Health (CVS). Cornell reasoned CVS could operate the pharmacies better and that the chain would also benefit from CVS's brand recognition.\n\nToday, all pharmacies in Target stores are run by CVS.\n\nOver the next two years, Cornell and his team worked to reestablish Target's private-label goods, improve online operations, and expand its grocery offerings.\n\nBut Cornell knew he had to swing bigger to redefine Target, even if it meant unsettling Wall Street and putting his job on the line.\n\nThe date was Feb. 28, 2017. Target had rented out a sleek banquet hall in New York City and invited the Wall Street community to attend. Cornell was set to finally reveal his vision for the Target of the future.\n\nTo say the tension in the room was palpable (I was in attendance) would be an understatement. Target, like many others in retail, was closing the books on a tough holiday shopping season. Its fourth quarter same-store sales fell 1.5%, store traffic rose a slim 0.2%, and earnings came in at the low end of guidance.\n\nThose numbers hit the newswires early on the morning of the 28th. The stock had already dropped 29% during the previous 12 months.\n\nCornell had been CEO for three years, and the heat was on to deliver a sustainable turnaround. Every analyst in the room knew it.\n\nIn his trademark black suit, Cornell delivered his startling long play: Target would spend $7 billion over the next three years to master digital shopping and woo picky millennials with growing families.\n\nThe plan was ambitious: It included more than 1,000 store remodels by the end of 2020; the opening of 30 small stores a year in urban areas dominated by CVS and Walgreens (WBA); the retraining of employees; a new staffing model for shipping online orders from the stores; an overhauled website, mobile app, and rewards program; and lower prices on groceries and consumables.\n\n\"That's the day I will remember forever. And I remember that day like it was just yesterday,\" Cornell said. Brian Cornell quote\n\nThe $7 billion price tag was a tough sell. I was there, canvassing the room, when Cornell revealed the number. Analysts looked at each other with stunned faces. Shock swept the room.\n\nThat enormous investment meant depressed profits and cash flow in the near future. Sales would suffer as construction crews renovated stores. There was little belief that Target would earn a solid return by investing in drastic changes, especially with a rejuvenated Walmart and a growing nation of dollar stores.\n\nTarget’s stock closed the Feb. 28, 2017, session down about 12%. Wall Street’s verdict on Cornell’s plan was two thumbs down.\n\nIn one final sign he wasn’t playing around, Cornell purchased same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million on Dec. 13, 2017. Many in retail had never heard of Shipt at the time. The price seemed astronomical. So ended a year of question marks for Target and the kid from Queens.\n\nThe Target of today\n\nThe Target of 2024 is now the byproduct of those tough decisions.\n\nThe company is on pace to notch close to $106 billion in sales this year, compared to $73 billion in 2014. Earnings per share will likely more than double compared to a decade ago. Target has added close to 200 new stories under Cornell's watch.\n\nWalk its aisles and you'll see new private-label brands, such as children's apparel brand Cat & Jack, part of a multibillion-dollar portfolio that has set Target apart in retail. The stores are selling more groceries than ever and also featuring Ulta (ULTA) and Disney (DIS) shops.\n\nShipt is now integral to Target’s same-day delivery and pick-up options. The company just launched its first membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon (AMZN) Prime and Walmart+.\n\nRead more: Target Circle 360 vs. Walmart+ and Amazon Prime: Which membership program is right for you?\n\nThis isn't to say Cornell hasn't faced additional roadblocks as he enters his final chapter at the helm.\n\nSome shoppers haven't forgotten about the company's controversial approach to marketing Pride merchandise in 2023. Target has subsequently been forced to take a more measured approach to merchandise and marketing that may get swept into the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nThe retailer has only recently begun to slash prices on key household items like milk to wrestle back lost market share from Walmart, which has produced a stretch of superior sales and profit growth.\n\nTarget's second quarter same-store sales rose 2%, while Walmart's increased 4.2%.\n\nAnd retail theft remains a financial headache, causing Target to lock up items such as underwear, socks, and detergent.\n\nIts stock is up 9% year to date, lagging the S&P 500's 20% gain. Walmart's stock shot up 52% this year, and Costco's (COST) has increased 39%.\n\n\"Brian Cornell did a great of reorienting Target. He got them out of Canada and refocused them on the real business,\" said retail expert Jan Kniffen. But Walmart has pulled ahead of Target in terms of operations and financial performance, a lead that may be in place for a while.\n\n\"Brian won a 10-year battle making Target a better retailer, but I fear he lost the war to Walmart and Amazon at the same time,\" Kniffen added.\n\nIn September 2022, Target scrapped its CEO retirement age of 65. Cornell signed on for three more years, making 2025 the year when a successor could be announced.\n\nThe top internal candidate looks to be Michael Fiddelke, who joined Target as an intern in 2003 and has risen the ranks to CFO and, most recently, COO. Brian Cornell quote\n\nOf course, Cornell could stay on for the job that clearly runs through his veins. He tells me he still \"loves\" what he does.\n\n\"One of the things that I spend a lot of time on and have for years is investing in talent development. I think as a CEO of a company like ours, it's one of my most important responsibilities is to make sure we're constantly developing talent to lead the company going forward,\" Cornell said about succession planning.\n\nHis legacy will be measured by the people he worked with, he said.\n\n\"Hopefully it goes back to the people that I've been able to mentor and coach and work with over the years that have moved onto bigger positions and had an impact. And hopefully, they'll remember the time and attention I paid to their development, that I was there when they needed somebody to talk to or the phone call that needed to be answered.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the robot revolution to end hard work",
        "content": "Inside many Amazon warehouses are workers known as “water spiders,” who pick up and move the numerous plastic storage bins used to shuttle goods around the facility, and who restock worker stations with merchandise, boxes, and other material. At a warehouse in Sumner, Wash., recently, a special crew of workers stepped in to help the people moving the plastic bins—­humanoid robots.\n\nThe droids, made by Agility Robotics, are about the size of a person and can walk around the warehouse floor as well as squeeze into tight spaces thanks to their backward knees. Amazon, which has invested in the startup through its Industrial Innovation Fund, is testing a handful of Digits (as the Agility robots are called), observing how well the droids communicate with its other warehouse systems, as well as how the company’s human workers feel about their robotic colleagues.\n\nFor most of modern history, robots that looked like us and walked like us have largely been relegated to movie and TV screens, while the robots in factories and other real-world settings have taken the less-sexy form of mechanical arms or oversize Roombas. That’s starting to change as a new crop of startups make humanoid robots a reality and promise corporate managers increased productivity and a solution to labor shortages. At a time when generative AI is already raising worries about job loss, however, the rise of the humanoids is likely to bring further urgency to public concerns about automation and employment.\n\nThe new machines look like something straight out of science fiction. Figure, a Sunnyvale, Calif., startup backed by­ OpenAI, recently unveiled its 02 model, a sleek matte-gray-and-black robot with six cameras for eyes and onboard AI to help it see and interact with humans. Carmaker BMW has tested a Figure robot at a South Carolina facility. Tesla CEO Musk, meanwhile, predicts his company’s Optimus robots will be in production for internal use by the end of 2025, and the following year for other companies.\n\nEven if Musk’s timeline proves fanciful (as his often do), the billionaire’s impact on the robotics sector is undeniable, says Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute professor Chris Atkeson. “When Elon Musk says he is going to create a new industry, people pay attention,” Atkeson tells Fortune.\n\nEqually important have been advances in robotic hardware and artificial intelligence. Nvidia, for example, recently announced a large AI model called Project GR00T, aimed at training humanoids, while OpenAI has launched an initiative to develop models for robotics.\n\nIn September, investment management firm ARK published a bullish report about humanoid robots that put the potential market at trillions of dollars. Although the report did not provide any specific timeline, it posited that if the cost of a humanoid robot were to be $16,000, the droid would need to deliver only 5% more efficiency than a human worker to be economically efficient.\n\nHow close we are to that day depends on who you talk to. Humanoids can cost around $150,000 each to produce according to a January report from Goldman Sachs (the companies declined to provide pricing to Fortune). Proponents of the humanoid form factor say that costs will only come down, and they talk of the technology’s game-­changing potential in ways that can sound utopian. “We’re basically going to live in a world where any physical labor is a choice,” says Brett Adcock, the founder and CEO of Figure.\n\n\"If a robot drops something or glitches in an elevator with someone—those things can't happen.\"\n\nBrad Porter, cofounder, Cobot\n\nAdcock’s company has raised more than $700 million since its 2022 founding and counts Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel Capital, and Jeff Bezos, via his investment firm, among its backers. Agility, led by former Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson, has raised $180 million and is seeking more. Johnson expects to produce hundreds of humanoids in 2025 at a facility in Salem, Ore., ramping up to thousands and eventually a maximum of 10,000 annually. Currently, Digit robots are doing real work moving containers inside a Spanx facility, as part of a multiyear deal between Agility and the warehouse operator GXO Logistics.\n\nFor all their promise, humanoids still have their limits. Many of the current robots can operate for only about four to five hours before needing a battery recharge. And not everyone is convinced that the human physique is the ideal form for a robot. Amazon spokesperson Xavier Van Chau told Fortune that while the e-commerce giant sees promise in the humanoid form factor, it hasn’t yet determined if it will use them long-term and also wants to test other types of robots, perhaps those that move with wheels instead of legs.\n\nOne humanoid skeptic is Brad Porter, the former vice president of robotics at Amazon. According to Porter, there’s a fundamental problem with creating a robot capable of operating autonomously in different settings: There’s not enough data to train AI models to safely control the robots.\n\n“We don’t have the equivalent of the internet where everyone just pumped all text onto the internet over the last 20 years,” he says, referring to the data that generative AI products like ChatGPT have been trained on. And humanoid robots present a whole new set of risks.\n\n“If ChatGPT throws an off-color joke every once in a while, it’s not really a problem, right?” he says rhetorically. “But if a robot throws an off-color middle finger or drops something, or glitches while it’s in an elevator with someone—those things can’t happen.”\n\nPorter isn't exactly a neutral observer. His startup Cobot is developing robots that use wheels instead of legs—a design he says is less costly and more practical for many tasks. A “swerve drive” allows the robot to move in any direction, while “multifunctional” arms can lift and grasp everything from boxes to trays. The company hasn’t announced any customers, but says its robots should be able to eventually work in settings ranging from manufacturing and fulfillment facilities to hospitals and stadiums. Among its investors is Amazon founder Bezos.\n\nWhatever shape these robots ultimately take, the question remains of what happens to human jobs as robot use increases. Agility’s Johnson says Digit is taking on tasks humans don’t want or that an aging workforce can’t or shouldn’t be doing. Figure’s Adcock is more fatalistic. Technological advancements, whether it’s the creation of a dishwasher or a human-mimicking robot, are inevitable: “It’s basically what’s been happening for two centuries.”\n\nThis article appears in the October/November 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline \"Meet your new coworker, the humanoid.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Palantir Stock vs. Amazon Stock: Wall Street Says Buy One and Sell the Other",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms let businesses develop and deploy machine learning models across use cases like content generation, predictive insights, and decision-making, and demand is increasing rapidly. \"AI platforms will be the fastest growing technology in the years to come,\" according to Andrea Minonne, research manager at the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nIDC estimates AI-platform spending will compound at 51% annually through 2028. That bodes well for Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), but Wall Street analysts expect the stocks to move in opposite directions over the next year.\n\nPalantir has a median price target of $27 per share, based on the estimates of 24 analysts. That implies a 27% downside from the current share price of $37. Amazon has a median price target of $220 per share, based on the estimates of 64 analysts. That implies a 15% upside from its current share price of $191.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these AI stocks.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir specializes in data analytics software. Its primary platforms, Foundry and Gotham, let businesses integrate data, develop machine learning models, and interact with those digital assets through prebuilt and custom applications that improve decision-making. AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) enhances Foundry and Gotham by adding support for large language models and generative artificial intelligence.\n\nPalantir's introduction of AIP last year captured the attention of analysts, and the company has been praised for its technological prowess. In August, Forrest Research recognized the company's leadership in AI and machine learning platforms. And in September, Dresner Advisory Services awarded Palantir the No. 1 spot in its AI, data science, and machine learning market study.\n\nPalantir reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 27% to $678 million, and non-GAAP earnings jumped 80% to $0.09 per diluted share. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Alex Karp attributed the strong performance to an \"unrelenting wave of demand from customers for artificial intelligence systems that go beyond merely performative and academic.\" In other words, businesses want products that make AI useful in real-world situations, and Palantir provides that with AIP.\n\nThe problem with Palantir is its valuation. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 115 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive.\n\nShares charged higher after the second-quarter report, and the stock continued climbing when Palantir was added the S&P 500 this month. But at the stock's current price, investors should avoid the stock and consider trimming their positions.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is gaining share across all three markets. According to eMarketer, the company will account for 40.4% of online retail sales in the U.S. this year, up from 39.6% last year. Amazon will also capture 13.9% of domestic digital ad spending this year, up from 12.5% last year, due to its dominance in the quickly growing retail media market.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the second quarter, up from 31% in the previous quarter, according to Synergy Research Group. And chief information officers (CIOs) recently surveyed by Morgan Stanley selected Microsoft Azure and AWS as the public clouds most likely to gain share in generative AI over the next three years. For AWS, that hints at strong demand for its AI platforms SageMaker and Bedrock.\n\nAmazon reported mixed results in the second quarter. Total revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, falling short of the $148.6 billion analysts forecasted. The reason for the shortfall was light advertising revenue. But GAAP earnings still jumped 94% to $1.26 per diluted share, crushing the consensus estimate of $1.03 per diluted share. However, the stock declined sharply when management provided underwhelming guidance, but patient investors have good reason to be optimistic.\n\nThree tailwinds should make Amazon more profitable in the next few years. First, the company is regionalizing its fulfillment network to streamline logistics and lower costs. Second, revenue is growing more quickly in the high-margin cloud and advertising segments, as compared to the low-margin retail segment. Third, cooling inflation should encourage consumer and business spending.\n\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings to grow at 25% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings seem reasonable, which lends credit to the median price target of $220 per share. More importantly, I think investors who buy a position in Amazon today will be very happy with their decision in five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bullish on Alphabet, as Cloud Computing Is the New Growth Engine for the Stock",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) stock has recovered quite nicely from the deep selloff it endured near the end of 2022, as its advertising channels continue to consistently deliver big numbers. While Alphabet still heavily depends on ad sales, the company’s new growth engine is Google Cloud. I’m bullish on both parts of the business, but Google Cloud offers more upside potential as the tech giant continues to gain ground on its peers.\n\nAdvertising Is Still the Main Engine\n\nAd revenue carries the bulk of the revenue load at Google, having generated $64.6 billion for the second quarter of 2024. That’s an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. Google Search and YouTube ads revenue jumped by 13.8% and 13.0% year-over-year, respectively. A bullish investor can take comfort in these numbers.\n\nGrowth in this segment is good for Alphabet’s profit margins, as the advertising segment is known for having high margins. Alphabet wrapped up the second quarter with a 27.9% net profit margin. Those margins will likely increase as the company delivers operational efficiencies including from cost cutting. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the company record a 30% net profit margin in at least one quarter in 2025 as profitability grows.\n\nAlphabet put itself in the spotlight when it announced its first dividend earlier this year. The yield is roughly 0.50%, and Alphabet will likely strive to make a further impression with a double-digit dividend hike in 2025.\n\nCloud Computing Will Fuel Future Growth\n\nThe results of Alphabet’s advertising division alone could make GOOGL stock attractive, but Google Cloud offers another reason to be bullish. This part of Alphabet’s business is growing much faster than its advertising segment, and it’s no longer a small offshoot like in previous years. Google Cloud revenue reached $10.4 billion in Q2, representing more than 12% of total revenue for the quarter.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s impact on future earnings reports will grow, and that’s good news for investors. Cloud revenue jumped by 28.8% year-over-year. That growth rate has been normal for Google Cloud, and its profitability is also improving. Google Cloud’s operating income almost tripled year-over-year, going from $395 million to $1.17 billion. Cloud profit margins have the potential to soar quickly, and the accelerated growth from this part of Alphabet’s business suggests higher profit margins are awaiting patient investors.\n\nAI Tailwinds Should Continue to Last\n\nAlphabet has a dominant position in artificial intelligence, a critical technology that can accelerate advertising and cloud revenue. The tech giant’s AI capabilities make me bullish. Alphabet is using AI to run better ads that maximize results for its customers. This will incentivize more ad spend as companies continue to invest in the marketing channels that drive the most results. Artificial intelligence has also strengthened Google Cloud’s core offering. Additionally, the intense bandwidth necessary for AI has also prompted more businesses to use Google Cloud.\n\nArtificial intelligence is still in its early innings. The industry is projected to achieve annualized growth of 19.3% from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. Alphabet is one of the leaders in software for companies looking to capitalize on artificial intelligence, and that should drive accelerating revenue growth from Google Cloud.\n\nGOOGL Valuation Is Better Than Other Cloud Giants\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), three of the largest companies in town, are all heavily focused on cloud computing. Together, these companies have helped pace the stock market in recent years.\n\nIn terms of relative valuation, Alphabet trades at a 23.4 P/E ratio, which is a lower valuation than for MSFT stock or AMZN stock. Microsoft carries a 36.5x P/E ratio, while Amazon’s multiple stands at 46.4x. Google’s relative valuation appeal makes it easier to be bullish on the stock. Alphabet has higher profit margins than Amazon and a higher net income growth rate than Microsoft.\n\nGoogle Cloud also grew faster than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Cloud in the second quarter. While Google Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% year-over-year, Amazon Web Services only registered 19% year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft Cloud fared slightly better with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, but both of those growth rates trail what Alphabet delivered. If Alphabet continues to gain market share in cloud computing, I predict the stock will perform well.\n\nIs Alphabet Stock a Buy?\n\nWall Street analysts currently hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on shares of GOOGL. From the 37 analysts covering the Alphabet stock, 28 offer Buy ratings while 9 have Hold ratings. No Wall Street analysts rate GOOGL stock a Sell. The average price target for GOOGL is $201.44, implying nearly 25% potential upside.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Alphabet Stock\n\nAlphabet has been a leading stock in recent years and has outperformed the S&P 500. While advertising revenue has historically been the driver of GOOGL, Google Cloud is the next captivating growth opportunity. Alphabet’s cloud platform growth is outpacing ad revenue growth and gaining ground on AWS and Microsoft Cloud. I’m bullish on GOOGL stock, especially with an undemanding 23.4 P/E ratio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Steven Cohen Just Sold Amazon Stock and Scooped Up This Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Member",
        "content": "Investment firms managing over $100 million in stocks are required to file a form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) once quarterly. These filings can be helpful as they provide a glimpse into what the companies' sophisticated investors, such as hedge fund managers, are buying and selling.\n\nOne investor I enjoy following is Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management. Last quarter, Point72 sold about 600,000 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock -- reducing its stake by 16%. At the same time, the hedge fund initiated a position in another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), buying almost 1.6 million shares.\n\nLet's dig into what may have driven these moves and assess whether Apple deserves a spot in your portfolio as well.\n\nWhy sell Amazon stock right now?\n\nAlthough Amazon is known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing enterprise, its ecosystem also spans advertising, streaming and entertainment, subscription services, and so much more. Considering generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to upend so many different end markets, it's not surprising to see that Amazon is emerging at the forefront of the AI conversation.\n\nSimply put, the technology has a chance to ignite all sorts of new growth opportunities for one of the world's largest and most diversified businesses -- and Amazon is making a lot of moves. For example, it invested $4 billion in a start-up called Anthropic. A cornerstone of this relationship is that Anthropic will train future versions of its large language models (LLM) on Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia semiconductor chips.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon recently announced an $11 billion infrastructure investment to build its own data centers in Indiana. This investment comes on the heels of Amazon's acquisition of a nuclear-powered data center back in March.\n\nAll told, Amazon is spending a lot of money on various AI initiatives. While I can't say for certain what drove Cohen and his team's calculus to trim the position in Amazon, it could be that the company's aggressive spending across the AI realm has inspired some questions regarding the return on these investments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy buy Apple stock right now?\n\nFor more than a year, Apple has struggled to demonstrate consistent revenue growth across both its line-up of products and in different geographic markets. While this dynamic has caused some to doubt Apple's growth prospects, I'd say the company's financial trends make some sense from a macro standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh levels of inflation and a rising interest rate environment have caused consumers in the U.S. to scale back on spending over the last couple of years. Moreover, a sluggish economy in China -- one of Apple's largest markets -- has been a theme from a global perspective that's impacted the company. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, all hope is not lost for Apple. In fact, the company could be looking at a couple of different catalysts right now.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone 16 launch is currently underway. Recent cuts to interest rates from the Federal Reserve could spark some newfound spending from rejuvenated consumers. In turn, Apple users may choose to upgrade their old iPhones -- leading to a so-called \"supercycle\" event for the company.\n\nMoreover, as Apple continues integrating more features leveraging OpenAI and AI technology into its products, demand for the company's newer hardware could witness a surge.\n\nShould you follow Cohen's moves?\n\nHere's the most important thing to note from Cohen's recent moves: Point72 still owns a lot of Amazon stock. In fact, even after trimming its position, Amazon remains Point72's largest position, comprising about 2% of the total portfolio.\n\nI think Cohen's purchase of Apple stock is a savvy move for a couple of reasons. First, adding Apple to the Point72 portfolio provides additional exposure and diversification among mega cap AI players.\n\nWhile companies such as Amazon have been making moves in the AI realm for some time now, Apple's initiatives have followed a slower pace. For this reason, there's an argument to be made that the AI narrative is less baked into Apple's stock price compared to Amazon's valuation.\n\nMoreover, the iPhone 16 launch and new AI integrations throughout the iOS ecosystem could spark some near-term sales growth, leading to longer-term tailwinds for Apple over time. This could make the timing of Cohen's Apple purchase a particularly smart move.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Cohen is merely hedging his various positions and diversifying his exposure to AI more broadly. Personally, I see both Amazon and Apple as rock-solid choices in a crowded AI landscape. I think Cohen's diversification strategy is a good one to replicate, especially for investors with a long-run time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman focus on value, and others like Ken Fisher focus on growth, Asness’ fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\n\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock’s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock’s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock’s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\n\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital’s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\n\nThese returns ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\n\nLooking at the returns for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are plotted over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\n\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund’s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return’s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022 according to Bloomberg,\n\nAQR’s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey’s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund’s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as Citadel Wellington, Point72, and Millennium 5.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\n\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness’ top stock picks, it’s also important to see how his firms’ funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed’s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% – 3.50% by 2025 end.\n\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR’s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index’s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark’s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks “considered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe” has been the way to go so far in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital’s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey’s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 308\n\nAQR Funds’ Latest Investment Stake: $1 billion\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American eCommerce and cloud computing company. The firm has one of the widest and most stable moats on Wall Street due to its dual business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s eCommerce operations provide it access to a sizeable market where it leads in the market by attracting billions of users (3.25 billion in June) to its website. Its scale also allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to enjoy competitive advantages such as a click to door speed of 1.9 days. Additionally, the cloud computing business enables the firm to beef up its margins, which are notoriously low for the eCommerce sector. It also provides Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) exposure to the AI industry, where it is one of the leaders due to its presence in all layers of the AI stack. This ranges from designing its own chips to having access to a foundational AI model via Claude, and AI end products through AWS.\n\nAlbyn Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“In his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon’s commitment to “primitive services” over the last 20 years – creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus). Amazon’s dominance comes not just from its scale but also from a relentless “customer obsession,” exemplified by its focus on building services that empower customers. This positions Amazon to capture significant shares of the growing retail and cloud markets. With a 45% share of online retail, which only makes up 25% of total retail sales, Amazon is well-placed for growth. The company’s expansion into the grocery sector, backed by investments in same-day delivery, shows promise. Currently, Amazon holds a 20% share of the grocery market, a segment that constitutes 34% of US retail sales but is only 12% penetrated. As online retail trends towards 40-50% penetration, Amazon’s growth potential is meaningful. Similarly, in the cloud sector, only 10% of IT spending has shifted to the cloud, with AWS holding a 35% market share.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list. While we acknowledge AMZN's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Breaking down Intel’s wild week",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is in the midst of one of the most tumultuous periods in its 56-year history. Declining sales, missed opportunities to compete in the AI space, and a massive turnaround effort by CEO Pat Gelsinger looking to return the company to its former glory are putting significant pressure on the chip giant’s bottom line and share price.\n\nAnd things for the company are only getting more interesting.\n\nLast Monday, Intel announced that it signed a deal with Amazon (AMZN) to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services, a positive sign for the company’s nascent third-party foundry business.\n\nThen, on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm (QCOM) reached out to Intel about a blockbuster takeover deal that would give Qualcomm a larger foothold in the PC and AI spaces. That’s not all. On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel to keep Gelsinger’s turnaround moving forward. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\nIt’s a lot to follow and even more to make any sense of. Luckily, I’m here to help break it all down for you.\n\nIntel’s slowing sales and AI troubles\n\nIntel is dealing with sliding sales and the unenviable position of having to take on market leader Nvidia in the AI space. For 2023, Intel reported full-year revenue of $54.2 billion, a 14% year-over-year decline from the $63.1 billion the company saw in 2022.\n\nThat included an 8% decline in Intel’s Client Computing Group, which sells chips for PCs; a 20% drop in Data Center and AI revenue; and a 31% decrease in Network and Edge sales. Intel did, however, report a 103% increase in its Intel Foundry Services, but that amounted to just $952 million. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger delivers a speech at the COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nPart of Intel’s woes have stemmed from the fact that the explosion in PC sales at the onset of the pandemic pulled Client Computing Group revenue forward several quarters, creating a boom and bust. Consumers bought new computers in droves for work and play, sending chip revenue soaring. But millions of consumers don’t usually buy new PCs at the same time. With so many people holding new computers, there were fewer consumers looking for upgrades, and sales entered an extended slump that sent shipments plummeting for eight consecutive quarters.\n\nSales are picking up again, though. In July, IDC said the PC market grew 3% in the second quarter, notching a second consecutive quarter of growth. But the industry still has a way to go.\n\nAt the same time, Intel is facing a new threat from Qualcomm, which began offering its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips in Windows PCs earlier this year as an alternative to Intel’s processors. Those chips provide improved performance and power versus Intel’s older offerings and are meant to compete with Apple’s (AAPL) exceptional M family of chips that power its MacBooks.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel is fighting back, though. Earlier this month, the company showed off its Core Ultra 200V line of processors that it says can outpace Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nFlagging PC sales also impacted graphics giant Nvidia (NVDA), which saw sales of its video game graphics chips deteriorate after the pandemic boom. But the company, unlike Intel, has managed to exploit its early investments in AI to take advantage of the surge in interest caused by the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nThat helped catapult Nvidia to the forefront of the semiconductor industry and sent its stock to extraordinary new heights, rising more than 860% over the last two years and 191% in the last 12 months.\n\nIntel is working to try to catch Nvidia with its own Gaudi line of AI accelerators. On Tuesday, the company debuted its latest Gaudi 3 AI accelerator and announced that IBM will use it as part of its IBM Cloud offering.\n\nBut with Gartner estimating that Nvidia controls more than 70% of AI chip sales, it’s an uphill battle.\n\nIntel’s foundry services\n\nIntel is also battling for position as a chip manufacturer for third-party clients. The plan is for the company’s foundry business to operate as a subsidiary of Intel that builds processors for customers looking for an alternative to TSMC, which is among the world’s largest chipmakers\n\nBut the buildout is costly and Wall Street isn’t completely sold on the idea. Analysts at Citi Research have said Intel should exit the foundry business altogether so that it can improve margins and earnings per share.\n\nIn September, however, Intel announced a multibillion-dollar deal to \"produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced process node.\" The company is also set to build a custom version of its Xeon 6 chip for Amazon.\n\nThe news comes after Intel announced that Microsoft signed on as a manufacturing customer in February. Two big-name companies are certainly a start for Intel, but it’s going to need to sign a slew of customers if it hopes to grow its manufacturing segment to match competing chip fabricators.\n\nQualcomm and Apollo\n\nIntel’s PC and AI woes have left it as a potential takeover target, which is where Qualcomm and Apollo enter the mix. Qualcomm, according to the Wall Street Journal, wants to buy up Intel, though it’s unclear if the company would hold on to all of Intel or sell portions of its business segments. The deal is also sure to generate plenty of antitrust concerns, as the companies are two of the most important chip firms in the US.\n\nApollo, meanwhile, looks to favor Gelsinger’s plans and could invest up to $5 billion in Intel to follow through with the effort, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNow investors will have to wait and see whether Intel moves forward with either company or continues to try to go it alone.

With the Federal Reserve implementing a substantial 50 basis-point rate cut, the benefits of which are expected to trickle down to them, consumers are forecasted to splurge on purchases this holiday season, according to early forecasts provided by Adobe on Wednesday.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing. Interest rate cuts could supercharge the real estate industry. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nVibrant Spending: Consumer E-commerce spending will likely reach a record $240.8 billion from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, Adobe said. This included spending online, discounting, ‘Buy Now, Pay Later,’ mobile shopping and more, it said. The forecast would mean an 8.4% year-over-year increase from the $221.8 billion spent in 2023, which saw a more modest 4.9% growth.\n\nElectronics, apparel and furniture/home goods will account for the bulk of the spending. The firm’s analytics show spending on Black Friday – the Friday that follows the Thanksgiving Thursday, and Thanksgiving day will grow 9.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Cyber Monday online spending is expected to be up a more modest 6.1%.\n\nAdobe expects discounts to peak at 30% this season, and drive over $2 billion in incremental online spending for retailers. The firm also said consumers will likely trade up to more expensive goods this season as opposed to the trend seen in recent months. Expensive goods will likely make up 19% of the share of the total online spending. In electronics, the share will likely be a steeper 58%.\n\nMobile shopping could make up 53.2% of total online spending and spending through BNPL could see another record this time. BNPL sales are expected to rise 11.4% to $18.5 billion, over 75% of this driven by mobile purchases.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest Time To Buy: This time around, discounts would be more spread out, with deals starting in October itself, Adobe said, adding that goods could trade up to 16% off the listed price in October. The discount could go up to 18% in November before the Cyber Week.\n\nHot Sellers: Among the most sought-after items are:\n\nBluey Ultimate Lights Sounds Playhouse​ Slime Kits Sony Group Corp.’s (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 5 Madden NFL 25 Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 ice cream maker Ninja Creami\n\nStock Implications: With most spending likely happening online, those retailers having a strong online presence could be the ones to benefit the most. Pureplay electronics retailers such as Best Buy, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBY), Apple and Sony, e-commerce giant Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and retailers such as Walmart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NYSE:COST) could also be preferred destination for buying consumer electronics goods.\n\nMadden NFL 25 is an American football video game developed by Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) Orlando and published by EA Sports. It could be bought on EA’s website, Amazon, or any other video game retailer.\n\nBNPL stocks such as Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and PayPal, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could reap the benefit of rising interest in purchases via the BNPL route.\n\nThe Commerce Department’s retail sales report for August released earlier this month showed an unexpected increase as weak auto & auto parts sales were more than offset by strength in online sales, underlining the underlying strength.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) ended Tuesday’s session up 0.80% at $77.13 but it has lost about 0.8% for the year even as the broader market hovers at a record high. The Fed rate cuts – the one announced and the two more anticipated before the year-end, and the seasonally strong holiday season could bring these stocks back to favor in the near term.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "content": "Google Challenges Microsoft's Cloud Dominance, Files Antitrust Complaint in Europe: Report\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) with the European Union’s top antitrust regulator Tuesday for allegedly abusing its influence to lock customers into Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure.\n\nGoogle Cloud Vice President Amit Zavery said that Microsoft customers had to pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators.\n\nFor nearly twenty years, Google became a target of EU antitrust action, partly stemming from complaints supported by Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nGoogle has long trailed Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services in the cloud business.\n\nGoogle’s complaint comes after Microsoft’s settlement of a complaint from a trade group representing European cloud services providers.\n\nGoogle argues that Windows Server customers are unfairly penalized if they want to use competing cloud services.\n\nGoogle has also made similar arguments to those of the U.K.’s competition regulator.\n\nEarlier this week, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria noted Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud are gaining traction in cloud and code generation businesses at the cost of Microsoft Azure.\n\nBig Tech companies have been drawing global regulatory scrutiny for their alleged anticompetitive practices, which have boosted their toplines and bottomlines. The companies allegedly created “walled gardens” under their products and services, preventing users from resorting to rival services.\n\nGoogle drew flak for paying companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to keep its search engine as the default for its devices. Apple also drew scrutiny for preventing users from using rival operating systems for its devices.\n\nReports claimed Amazon’s alleged antitrust practices of preferential treatment to its products on its platforms could lead to the company’s breakup. Google also faced similar concerns. However, Wedbush’s Dan Ives snubbed worries over the breakup of Big Techs for alleged violation of antitrust norms.\n\nPrice Actions: MSFT stock is up 0.55% at $431.54 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) workers upset about the end of remote work are trying to get the company to reconsider.\n\nHundreds of workers at the e-commerce giant said in a survey that the policy announced last week mandating five days a week in the office will negatively affect their work and life, according to Fortune.\n\nThe survey commissioned by employees showed that the 5-day-in-office policy got an average rating of 1.4 on a one to five scale, with one being strongly dissatisfied and five being strongly satisfied.\n\n“I work with people across many time zones,” one survey response reviewed by Fortune (TIME) read. “With RTO, they no longer have the flexibility to easily shift hours and collaborate. 3 day had an instant impact here, and 5 day will only be worse.”\n\nOthers said people actually had more time to work when they were remote because they didn’t waste time commuting.\n\nIn the wake of the policy change, some employees said they were looking for new jobs.\n\n“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” CJ Felli, a system development engineer for Amazon Web Services, wrote on Linkedin. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”\n\nThe dissatisfaction comes as Amazon ended another remote work policy that allowed employees to work from any location within their country of employment for four weeks a year. Amazon originally had said this program would end, but didn’t give a start date. On Monday, it updated its guidance to say the program was ending immediately, Business Insider reported.\n\n“They don’t want us here,” one worker told the outlet in response to the change, saying they suspect the new policy is meant to push employees out and reduce the headcount.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said he believes the new policy, which goes into effect on Jan. 2, 2025, will better set up Amazon “to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\n\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\n\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

        "title": "‘Strongly dissatisfied’: Amazon employees plead for reversal of 5-day RTO mandate in anonymous survey",
        "content": "Some Amazon workers are refusing to \"disagree and commit,\" as one of the company's famed leadership principles requires of those who aren't on board with a decision.\n\nInstead, hundreds of the online retailing giant's employees are complaining that CEO Andy Jassy's five-days-per-week return-to-office mandate, announced last week, will negatively impact their lives—and productivity at work—and how they hope the company will reverse course.\n\nThe feedback is from an anonymous survey created by Amazon employees that was viewed by Fortune on Tuesday. Corporate employees have shared it widely via the messaging app Slack, including in one \"remote advocacy\" Slack channel with more than 30,000 members that a former employee created when Amazon first announced a three-day return-to-office mandate last year.\n\nAs a result, employees who are in favor of remote or hybrid work may have been more likely to respond to the survey and therefore skew the findings.\n\nAs of the afternoon of September 24, the average satisfaction rating related to the RTO mandate among survey respondents was 1.4 out of scale up to 5 (with 1 meaning \"strongly dissatisfied\" and 5 representing \"strongly satisfied\"). The survey's creators said in an introduction to their questionnaire that they plan to aggregate and share the results by email with Jassy and other company executives \"to provide them with clear insight into the impact of this policy on employees, including the challenges identified and proposed solutions.\"\n\n\"We are seeking honest, constructive feedback on the recent decision to require a 5-day return to the office schedule,\" the survey introduction reads.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nAmazon has used a hybrid work structure for the past 15 months before Jassy's recent bombshell announcement that most corporate employees would be required to work a full five-day work week from their local Amazon office starting in January.\n\n\"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” Jassy wrote last week. “I’ve previously explained these benefits, but in summary, we’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.”\n\nJassy explanation about the new mandate, and a second one announcing a planned thinning of middle management, came across as tacit acknowledgements of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently detailed.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortune has talked to and messaged with several dozen Amazon corporate employees since last week's announcement, with most opposing Jassy's decision for reasons including reduced productivity during in-office work days and leadership's lack of trust in rank-and-file employees and managers, based on the change in RTO policy. They also complained about the impact the policy will have on single parents and a lack of data explaining the decision from a company whose leaders often talk up data-backed decision-making.\n\nSome, however, applauded the move in communications with Fortune and argued that using the length or cost of commutes as excuses to avoid five days in the office weekly would have seemed absurd just a few years ago pre-pandemic.\n\nStill, most respondents opposed the change or cited complications that the new policy will create.\n\n\"I work with people across many time zones,\" one response read. \"With RTO, they no longer have the flexibility to easily shift hours and collaborate. 3 day had an instant impact here, and 5 day will only be worse.\"\n\nAs for a solution, the employee suggested \"more realistic work expectations if we're eliminating WFH.\"\n\n\"Amazon got used to people having an extra 5-10 hours a week to work because we weren't commuting,\" the employee said. \"RTO means that we no longer have the extra time to commit to Amazon and expectations of employees needs to adjust to reflect that. On a similar note, we need to accept that RTO places hard limits on meeting times. I can't hop onto an 8am meeting with the folks in HQ2 or the East Coast anymore. When I was at home, I could jump on early or late meetings pretty easily, but I'm physically unable to do that now.\"\n\nSeveral respondents focused on the trust, or distrust factor, and the fear, echoed by many employees, that the move will drive out top talent who can easily find work elsewhere, while other groups with fewer options remain.\n\n\"The people that leave first are the strong engineers you want to work with,\" one wrote. \"Others that can't find new jobs or can't leave due to visa are miserable and quiet quit. Anyone left that actually wants to work has to pick up the slack.\"\n\nYet another, echoing others, said they believe that the mandate \"ignores the challenge of requiring people to come into an office, but all of their work and every meeting is executed over chime or video conference.\"\n\nMost of those who chose \"satisfied\" or \"strongly satisfied\" did not leave remarks beyond their rating, or left a negative remark that signaled they may have accidentally selected a positive rating.\n\nThe bad news for those dissatisfied with the new return-to-the-office rule is that when a group of Amazon employees sent a six-page memo to leadership last year making the case to reverse the original three-day in-office mandate, it was dismissed. With Jassy and team digging in their RTO heels further, it's hard to imagine these results producing any significant change.\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $193.96, moving +0.04% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.25% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.56%.\n\nShares of the online retailer witnessed a gain of 10.47% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 5.28% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.65%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.14 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 34.12%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $157.05 billion, indicating a 9.76% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.49 billion, indicating changes of +63.45% and +10.39%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Amazon is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 40.87. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.89.\n\nMeanwhile, AMZN's PEG ratio is currently 1.49. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.05 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 55, placing it within the top 22% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Salesforce's Free Cash Flow Could Double by 2029 Amid AI Push, Analyst Says While Upgrading Stock\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin upgraded Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) from Neutral to Overweight and raised the price target from $268 to $325.\n\nThe re-rating reflects a favorable risk-reward given the potential for free cash flow per share to double to $20+ by fiscal 2029 (calendar 2028) from $9.65 in fiscal 2024 (calendar 2023), even if top-line growth remains at subdued levels of 8%-9%.\n\nBracelin flagged that Salesforce also has the lowest valuation multiple relative to large-cap software peers on an Enterprise Value-to-Sales, Enterprise Value-to-Free Cash Flow, and Price-to-Earnings basis.\n\nAlso Read: NVIDIA, Salesforce Announce Strategic AI Collaboration: What To Know\n\nDiscussions last week with the leadership team, partners, and customers gave the analyst confidence that new pricing and packaging could broaden multi-cloud adoption.\n\nThe promise of Agentforce powered by the Atlas Reasoning Engine paired with Data Cloud could help stabilize demand and drive a recovery entering calendar 2026 (fiscal 2027).\n\nBracelin raised estimates using a target EV/FCF of 23x (versus 22x prior) and a 14% discount rate (16% prior).\n\nBracelin noted that the combination of free multi-cloud options via the new Foundations suite for existing Sales or Service cloud customers and the 52% ARPU uplift to Einstein 1 versus Unlimited could be crucial in sparking a growth recovery from calendar 2025 (fiscal 2026) to calendar 2026 (fiscal 2027).\n\nThe analyst flagged that Salesforce has historically provided new platform updates three times per year. However, the pace of AI has changed this cadence, most notably within Data Cloud, where new platform updates are released monthly.\n\nSalesforce chief Marc Benioff and team are operating in “founder mode” with the accelerated pace of internal product execution, supported by veteran boomerangs and new management add that bring strong backgrounds from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and more Bracelin highlighted.\n\nYears of manual Trailblazer developer work building Flows and Apex Actions have turned into a strategic advantage, according to the analyst. He added that these can be repurposed to provide critical guard rails to power agents via the Atlas Reasoning Engine paired with Data Cloud.\n\nFurther margin leverage and buybacks could sustain low double-digit free cash flow growth per share for the next 3-5 years. CRM shares could benefit from earnings and multiple expansions, as per Bracelin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBracelin projects third-quarter revenue of $9.34 billion and EPS of $2.43.\n\nPrice Action: CRM stock is up 1.35% at $267.67 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSalesforce Unveils New Agentforce Partner Network, Partners With Google Cloud\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Wedbush Maintains Outperform Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Raymond James Maintains Strong Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Intel launches new AI chips as takeover rumors swirl",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) revealed a pair of AI chips on Tuesday as it seeks to improve its data center business and steal market share from rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). The new chips, the Xeon 6 CPU and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, promise improved performance and power efficiency and come at a time when Intel is trying to prove it has what it takes to be a major player in the AI space.\n\nThe announcement follows a Wall Street Journal report that Qualcomm is looking into a potential takeover of Intel to bolster its own chip business. Bloomberg, meanwhile, reported that Apollo Global Management is interested in making a multibillion-dollar investment in the chipmaker that would back Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s massive turnaround plan. Apollo is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.\n\nIntel says the new Xeon 6 chip offers P-cores, or performance cores, and says it features twice the performance of its predecessor. The chip, according to the company, is built for AI and high-performance compute scenarios including edge and cloud systems.\n\nThe Gaudi 3 processor, on the other hand, is purpose-built for generative AI applications and will compete directly with Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s MI300X line of chips. Intel says IBM (IBM) is using its Gaudi 3 accelerators as part of its IBM Cloud with the goal of offering a lower overall total cost of ownership. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Demand for AI is leading to a massive transformation in the data center, and the industry is asking for choice in hardware, software, and developer tools,” Intel's executive vice president and general manager of its Data Center Artificial Intelligence Group Justin Hotard said in a statement.\n\n“With our launch of Xeon 6 with P-cores and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, Intel is enabling an open ecosystem that allows our customers to implement all of their workloads with greater performance, efficiency, and security.”\n\nIntel was also quick to point out that 73% of GPU-accelerated servers, servers designed to power AI applications, use Xeon chips as the host CPUs they need to function properly. But Intel’s chips aren’t the hot tickets they once were. Companies instead are trying to get their hands on Nvidia’s line of AI chips, sending that company’s stock price soaring.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up a staggering 142% year to date, while Intel shares have fallen a whopping 52%. AMD shares are up 12% in the same time period.\n\nDuring its latest quarterly earnings report in August, Intel reported worse-than-anticipated revenue and earnings per share and provided a disappointing outlook for its current quarter. The company also said it would cut 15% of its workforce and suspended its dividend payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nGelsinger is attempting to return Intel to its former glory by pushing its teams to build more advanced chips for the data center and consumer PCs while simultaneously building out its manufacturing capabilities.\n\nIntel hopes to dramatically expand its chip fabs, the facilities where it produces chips, both in the US and abroad. But the company announced last week that it will put construction of planned plants in Europe on hold and that it won’t start up its advanced packaging plant in Malaysia until demand for chips picks up.\n\nIntel offered some good news last week, as well, saying that it will build custom chips for Amazon (AMZN), joining Microsoft (MSFT) as another marquee client for the company’s nascent third-party chip manufacturing business.\n\nThe firm also said it is separating its foundry segment from its design business to provide a clearer separation between the two entities, giving potential customers greater peace of mind that Intel’s design team wouldn’t have access to their own chip designs.\n\nBut Intel’s struggles amidst the turnaround have made it a takeover target for the likes of Qualcomm, which could use the company to significantly expand its chip business into the data center and PC businesses.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) relies heavily on its smartphone segment. But smartphone sales have slowed over the years as customers have begun holding on to their handsets longer, leading Qualcomm to look for new growth opportunities.\n\nOne such opportunity includes building laptop chips meant to rival Intel’s own line of processors. It will, however, take a good deal of time for Qualcomm to chip away at Intel’s PC market share if it manages to do so at all. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "TikTok to shutter music streaming business in win for Spotify, Apple",
        "content": "TikTok will shut down its music streaming service beginning Nov. 28, just two years after parent company ByteDance aimed to compete with the likes of Spotify (SPOT) and Apple Music (AAPL).\n\nThe company is encouraging its users to utilize the “Add To Music App” feature, which lets users save the songs they discover on TikTok to the music streaming services of their choice. Users were told to transfer playlists to other services no later than Oct. 28.\n\n\"We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok’s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters and the industry,\" Ole Obermann, global head of music business development at TikTok, said in a statement.\n\nThe move represents a shift in strategy for the company, which now no longer wants to compete with third party streaming services. Rather, it wants to continue to partner with them.\n\nSpotify shares ticked higher in early trading following the news, up more than 1%.\n\nByteDance first initiated talks with music labels to expand the music streaming service, originally dubbed Resso, in 2022. At the time, the goal was to utilize TikTok's ability to discover new music and make songs go viral.\n\nThe new platform, which signed licensing deals with major record labels including Sony Music Entertainment (SONY), Warner Music Group (WMG) and Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), launched in July 2023 with a new name: TikTok Music. It was initially rolled out in Indonesia and Brazil before quickly entering markets including Australia, Mexico and Singapore.\n\nBut the company has recently found itself in hot water with those labels over a variety of issues, from appropriate compensation for artists and songwriters to protections from artificial intelligence.\n\nEarlier this year, TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) faced a months-long dispute that eliminated the songs of top artists, including Taylor Swift, Drake, Justin Bieber, and Adele, among others, from the platform.\n\nThe dispute was eventually resolved in May with the two sides signing an updated agreement that addressed some of the concerns.\n\nTikTok is currently at the center of a bipartisan political battle after President Biden signed new legislation that will ban the app in the US unless ByteDance divests its ownership stake.\n\nAfter filing a lawsuit to block the new legislation, TikTok argued its case in front of a federal appeals court last week. But if that fails, a ban could come as early as January 2025.\n\nStory continues ARCHIVE - TikTok will shut down its music streaming service beginning Nov. 28 (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, Archive) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlexandra is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Still a Promising AI Stock?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nFollowing the aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the market roared to new highs but quickly lost enthusiasm as investors look for clues on what might be ailing the economy that pushed the Fed to go more dovish than expected. However, others think the bull market is going to continue.\n\nBMO Capital’s Brian Belsk has raised the S&P 500 target for 2024 to 6,100 from 5,600. Talking to CNBC in a latest program, Belsk said the “resiliency” of this bull market is “undoubted.”\n\nThe analyst said that the stock market is going higher through the end of this year.\n\n“We do believe that the Fed is doing a great job. We believe the Fed that we are not hitting into a recession. We believe the Fed that we are heading into more of a soft landing,” the analyst said.\n\nBelsk thinks we are in the “1995-1996 environment” where we can “handle” the 24x earnings multiple.\n\nThe analyst added that the Mag. 7 stocks underperformed the market in the third quarter and yet the broader market grew, which shows the market rally is broad.\n\nFor this article we chose 10 AI stocks trending on the back of latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Buzzing AI Stock Now?\n\nFrank Gaertner / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nAnkur Crawford, Alger executive VP, while talking to CNBC in a latest program said that in about 3 to 5 years AI is going to provide us with superhuman intelligence.\n\n“All of the CapEx being spent today is whole-heartedly justifiable because the opportunity to monetize that AI by that time is beyond what anyone has contemplated in the market so far.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top AI picks of Ankur Crawford.\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\n“Despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,” Cantor said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nHayden Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we’ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today\n\nSome of our biggest winners in the last two years, have been “re-acceleration” stories. These are cases where once rapidly growing companies suddenly put the brakes on during a weak economy. There could be several reasons for this – customers pulling back during a recession, the company proactively curtailing growth spend as a precaution, needing to cut costs & right-size the business to become profitable quickly, or many other reasons.\n\nBut the commonality seems to be that as soon as growth stops, the market narrative turns suddenly from positive, to “this company is finished”. They go from being valued for many years of rapid growth, to being priced like a mature company that will never realize significant growth again. But often neither scenario is true, with the ultimate future path somewhere in between.\n\nI find the fact this type of opportunity even exists, fascinating. Especially since it seems to happen every bear-market – perhaps indicating it’s embedded in human nature (and thus persistent & likely minable throughout one’s investing career). For example, I gave the examples of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock performance in our Q1 2022 letter (please re-read this piece for more context; LINK)…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Amazon (AMZN) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.06, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.06 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 44 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 93.6% and 6.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.74.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Jake Spring\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon and other companies have agreed to buy carbon offset credits that will support the conservation of its namesake rainforest in the Brazilian state of Para, in a deal valued at around $180 million.\n\nAmazon and at least five other firms will make the purchase through the LEAF Coalition forest conservation initiative, which it helped to found in 2021 with a group of companies and governments including the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nThe agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.\n\nThe Para state government and the LEAF Coalition first shared details of the deal exclusively with Reuters. Para Governor Helder Barbalho is set to announce the agreement on Tuesday evening during New York Climate Week, when about 900 events will be held alongside the UN General Assembly.\n\n\"Clearly it sends an important message: A company with a name referencing the Amazon making its first purchase with a state in the Amazon,\" Barbalho told Reuters.\n\nAmazon confirmed the purchase in a statement, emphasizing the importance of tropical forest preservation in addressing climate change.\n\nWhile demand for carbon credits globally has stalled, tech giants Microsoft, Meta and Google have all made purchases of offsets in Brazil this year.\n\nAmazon, drug and chemical maker Bayer, consultancies BCG and Capgemini, clothing retailer H&M and Walmart will collectively buy 5 million credits at $15 per credit. That is far above the average last week of $4.49 for carbon credits linked to nature, according to data provider Allied Offsets.\n\nEach credit represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions from reducing deforestation in Pará state in the years 2023 to 2026.\n\nAnother 7 million credits will be made available for other companies to purchase. The U.S., U.K. and Norwegian governments have guaranteed a portion of those credits and will buy them if companies do not.\n\nPara will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.\n\nPara has been the top state for deforestation since 2005, although destruction has been falling there since 2021. An area larger than New York City has been deforested in Para from January to August this year, a 20% decline from a year ago, according to preliminary federal government data.\n\n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon demands a lot from its drivers. Now they're pushing back",
        "content": "Rajpal Singh sweltered on his routes, delivering hundreds of packages every day for Amazon to homes on twisty dirt roads in the hills and valleys surrounding Lancaster and Palmdale. Temperatures in his van commonly climbed above 100 degrees.\n\nThe $19.75 hourly wage Singh said he was paid by Battle-Tested Strategies, a delivery company that counted Amazon as its only client, didn't make up for the grind of the job.\n\n\"None of us felt we were being paid fairly,\" Singh said of other drivers at the company. \"That’s barely a living wage. Anyone who lives in L.A. County knows the truth, that most of us are going around figuring out which bills we are going to pay, how we are going to make sure there’s food on our table.”\n\nFed up, Singh and other drivers banded together. They demanded better working conditions and later took steps toward unionizing. Not long after Amazon officials got wind of the agitation, the retail giant canceled its contract with the company, forcing it to close and putting Singh and the others out of work.\n\nUntil getting laid off, Singh was part of an army of drivers who make up the backbone of Amazon, a juggernaut that totaled nearly $575 billion in revenue last year. A ubiquitous presence on city, suburban and country roads across the U.S., they race daily in a nonstop push to keep pace with the insatiable demand for doorstep delivery that Amazon itself helped create.\n\nLong-running frustrations over pay and working conditions underscore tensions built into the delivery system Amazon has constructed, in which it contracts with a vast network of independent companies like Battle-Tested Strategies instead of hiring drivers directly. The friction has escalated in recent months as drivers increasingly are following the lead of peers like Singh in pushing back against the arrangement, which they say has allowed Amazon to skirt responsibility for workplace issues. A handful of unionization efforts have taken root around the country, with drivers emboldened by recent findings by the National Labor Relations Board that called into question whether Amazon can keep its drivers at arm's length.\n\nRead more:Three months ago they unionized. Now a strike by Amazon contract drivers is heating up\n\nIn one of those rulings, an NLRB regional director in Los Angeles determined last month that Amazon was a \"joint employer\" of the drivers who delivered packages for the now-defunct Battle-Tested Strategies. And last week, a regional director in Atlanta determined Amazon should be held liable for allegedly making threats and other unlawful statements to drivers seeking to unionize in the city.\n\nAmid the growing unrest, last week the company announced a $660-million investment in its network of delivery companies, called the Delivery Service Partner program. With the infusion, which is intended to boost drivers' pay, Amazon said it expects the national average pay for drivers to increase by $1.50, to nearly $22 per hour, a 7% increase over last year.\n\nThe pay hike, however, appears to have only strengthened the resolve of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the powerful union leading the push to organize Amazon's drivers.\n\n“The trillion-dollar company thinks small raises for drivers will distract them from fighting for fair pay and safe jobs in a Teamster contract,\" said Randy Korgan, director of the Teamsters Amazon Division, in an emailed statement.\n\n\"If Amazon is serious, they need to put it in writing and respect what these workers are asking for, because every worker knows their word is no good,” he said.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Maya Vautier said the investment in driver pay is not a response to the recent union pressures but part of normal adjustments the company makes to driver pay this time each year. Last year’s increase raised the average hourly pay for a driver by $1, to $20.50.\n\n“We make these investments every year,” Vautier said.\n\nCaught in the middle of the simmering labor fight are owners of the delivery companies.\n\nOne of them was Johnathon Ervin, who started Battle-Tested Strategies. The seasoned Air Force veteran and reserve officer was working as a contractor for weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman when he came across an ad by Amazon in 2018 targeting veterans looking to start their own companies.\n\nAmazon was pitching a new program that offered the chance to start a delivery company for as little as $10,000 in startup costs, Ervin recalled. Ervin traveled to Seattle on his own dime in 2019 for the training Amazon required of its delivery contractors and soon after launched his company. The arrangement required Ervin to hire his drivers and rent delivery vehicles and equipment from Amazon. Johnathon Ervin owned now-defunct Battle-Tested Strategies, a delivery company whose only client was Amazon. (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)\n\nHis business earned glowing performance reviews from Amazon. In a 2020 newsletter, Amazon championed Ervin as a face of its commitment to Black business owners.\n\nErvin said his relationship with Amazon soured in the summer of 2022, when one of Battle-Tested Strategies' drivers had to be taken to the emergency room as a result of heat stress. Amazon's reaction was to ask when the driver was expected to return to the station, Ervin said.\n\nIn 2022, after Amazon managers heard about the petition for better heat safety measures circulating among his drivers, Ervin said he was required by the company to have one of his supervisors complete an anti-union training with a legal firm Amazon retains for its delivery service partners. Amazon's overall handling of drivers' concerns was a red flag, he said.\n\n“My main duty is the welfare, morale and training of troops. That’s extremely important. It’s in my DNA. And so anybody that works for me, whether it be in the military, or here at Amazon, I see them as my troops, and they need to be taken care of,” he said.\n\nIn early 2023, as the drivers were continuing to organize, Amazon began grounding his vehicles for what Ervin described as bogus reasons during daily safety checks that had never raised issues before, such as a scratch on a rear light and a slightly bent license plate. As a result, he was hit with several \"breach of contract\" notices by the company.\n\nIn April of that year, Amazon gave Ervin 60 days' notice that it was terminating his contract. When his drivers pressed ahead with plans to unionize, which Ervin publicly supported, an Amazon spokesperson lashed out at them and Ervin. Battle-Tested Strategies, she said, “had a track record of failing to perform and had been notified of its termination for poor performance well before today’s announcement.\"\n\nRead more:Delivery drivers at third-party company in Palmdale are Amazon employees, NLRB finds\n\nLosing the company was a blow to Ervin, who estimates he had invested $35,000 of his own money to start it up, and saw his dreams for building a successful, profitable company crumble.\n\n\"I've lost everything,\" Ervin said.\n\nAlthough they arrived too late to help him, Ervin said the NLRB's findings in the case brought by his former drivers was a \"monumental victory\" that resonates with \"every Amazon subcontractor and employee who has felt the heavy hand of intimidation and bullying by Amazon.\" The board concluded that as a joint employer of its drivers, Amazon cannot use its network of delivery companies to shield itself from some responsibility for working conditions.\n\nAmazon and the Teamsters are in negotiations as a result of the NLRB's findings. The NLRB did not find merit to all of the Teamsters’ allegations regarding Battle-Tested Strategies. It dismissed, for example, the claim that Amazon’s decision to end its contract with Battle-Tested Strategies was retaliatory. If the parties do not reach a settlement in the case, the labor agency would issue a formal complaint based on its findings. After that, the case would be heard by an administrative law judge, who could order the company to implement remedies. The judge’s decision could then be appealed to the labor board in Washington.\n\nOther former owners and managers of delivery companies have raised similar concerns about the power Amazon wields over the companies in the Delivery Service Partner program and the implications for driver safety. Some have filed lawsuits alleging unfair treatment, false promises about profits, and unlawful termination of their delivery contracts. Johnathon Ervin inspects delivery vehicles that were grounded in 2023. Amazon later terminated his contract. (Dania Maxwell / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn a proposed class-action suit filed in federal court in Seattle in 2022, Sacramento delivery company Fli-Lo Falcon alleged that Amazon “exercises near complete control” over subcontracted delivery companies, treating them as franchisees without any of the legal protections that designation would afford them.\n\nOver the summer, drivers in Skokie, Ill., went public with plans to join the Teamsters, demanding Amazon recognize their union. Instead, Amazon terminated its contract with the delivery company they worked for, Four Star Express Delivery.\n\nAnd earlier this month, hundreds of drivers from several delivery companies in Queens, N.Y., staged a walkout to announce they were joining the Teamsters and to demand Amazon negotiate a contract with them.\n\nAmazon, as it has in the past, disputes that subcontracted delivery drivers are employees of Amazon. The company disputes that it cut ties with Four Star Express Delivery, saying instead that Four Star voluntarily exited the program.\n\n\"These claims are false and based on either a misunderstanding or intentional misrepresentation of the facts. The truth is that there are multiple independent small businesses that deliver for us ... and none of [the drivers] are Amazon employees,\" Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said in an emailed statement, referring to the Skokie activity.\n\nThe workers in Queens also are not Amazon employees, Paradis said, adding that \"the Teamsters are well aware that the NLRB has not ruled that Amazon is a joint employer for these drivers, but they continue to lie because they want to deceive drivers.”\n\nThe recent NLRB findings probably helped to boost the burst of union campaigns, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n“History has shown that Amazon is willing to simply sever the contracts of delivery companies whose workers do agree to unionize, so the Teamsters are figuring this is their best shot at making some cracks at Amazon,” Rosenfeld said.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) the Best Growth Stock To Buy According To George Soros?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To George Soros. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\n\nThe Man Who Broke the Bank of England\n\nGeorge Soros, the owner of Soros Fund Management, is known as one of the most controversial investors in the history of investing. The now 94-year-old, “broke the Bank of England” after he reportedly made $1 billion from shorting the British pound in 1992. As of September 19, Soros has a net worth of $7.2 billion. He managed client money in New York from 1969 to 2011.\n\nSoros Fund Management was founded in 1970 and manages almost $28 billion in net assets at the moment. The fund is the principal asset manager for Soros’ philanthropic venture, the Open Society Foundations (OSF). So far he has given away more than $32 billion of his fortune to the OSF. Last year, Soros handed over the fund to his eldest son, Alexander Soros, who now aims to take his philanthropic endeavors to another level.\n\nGeorge Soros’ Investment Philosophy\n\nSoros is known for being ahead of the market. Historically, he has made financial decisions after gauging market feedback and predicting market activities, that have returned or saved him millions, if not billions. This is what he calls the “reflexivity” theory. By applying this theory to finance and investments, Soros values assets based on market feedback, predicts market bubbles, and exploits market opportunities. A recent example of this was when Soros pulled out a staggering $73 million from two major technology players right before the tech downturn in mid-July.\n\nSoros also uses another method, which he calls the Soros’ Method, to forecast events in the financial markets using current data. He then tests his theories on small investments and if the theory seems to be working out, he expands his position or size of his investment. This, however, does not mean that Soros has never failed or encountered risk during his time as an investor. He has made multiple expensive decisions from which he learned lessons and has even quoted them in his books. Here is an excerpt of what he said in his book, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\n“The prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. … I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOne can say that Soros’ degree in philosophy helped him carve his way into the financial markets. Now that we have studied Soros’ investment philosophy, let’s take a look at the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros, we examined his 13F portfolio and selected his top 10 growth stock picks, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 20 Most Reputable and Trustworthy Companies in the World\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nSoros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $56.21 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\n\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies.\n\nAmazon’s growth is undeniable which explains its position in Soros’s portfolio. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 16% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Intel Stock Sealed a Strong Week: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Intel Corporation INTC shareholders had to bear painful losses throughout this year as the company struggled to make a breakthrough in its stumbling foundry business. However, Intel’s foundry spin-off move, a deal with Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, and a probable QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM takeover boosted its share prices last week.\n\nDoes this mean the INTC stock has room to run soon, or is it just a temporary uptick? Is it time to buy the INTC stock, or is it prudent to wait for an opportune moment? Let’s see –\n\nIntel Stock Bounces Back\n\nIt’s been a tough year for Intel, with its shares down 57%, in sharp contrast to the Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of 93.3%. Intel has been dealing with costly technological advancements that have led to various cash concerns and compelled the company to suspend dividend payments and cut jobs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIntel’s failure to take advantage of the booming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has also taken a toll on the stock. However, a trifecta of events helped the Intel stock to rebound last week, with the company’s shares soaring more than 11%, its best weekly performance since November.\n\nWhat Led to the Rise in Intel Share Prices?\n\nAs per a Wall Street Journal report, Qualcomm has approached Intel for a probable takeover, which should bode well for both companies. Intel manufactures personal computers (PC) and server chips, whereas Qualcomm makes mobile products. So, a deal should help both companies to make the most of the other’s strengths and improve market share.\n\nMoreover, Intel has a manufacturing hub that makes its chips. Thus, a potential deal will allow Qualcomm to have its manufacturing facility and not pay for outsourcing, eventually boosting margins.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, has declared a new partnership with Amazon, where Amazon Web Service (AWS) will use Intel’s custom chip designs. Amazon is partnering with Intel for chip design since NVIDIA Corporation NVDA has increased its pricing for the e-commerce giant.\n\nThe Intel-Amazon deal will help the semiconductor company to regain market share from NVIDIA, which is becoming a worldwide leader in AI (read more: Post-Fed Rate Cut: Buy, Hold, or Sell NVIDIA Stock?).\n\nLastly, Intel declared it would convert its foundry business into a subsidiary. This is positive news for Intel investors since they were concerned about the company handing over chip designs to industry rivals.\n\nThe spin-off would help the struggling foundry business secure funding since this segment hasn’t performed well recently compared to Intel’s design arm. Intel’s foundry business faced stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited TSM, or TSMC, and reported operating losses in the first half of 2024 (read more: The Better Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now: TSM or INTC).\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, separating the foundry business would improve Intel’s return on capital deployed. Intel also intends to spend heavily on its foundry business to lure U.S. chipmakers to rely more on domestic manufacturers than foreign companies like TSMC.\n\nDoes Intel’s Strong Week Justify a Buy Decision Today?\n\nIntel CEO Patrick Gelsinger is banking on the tech deals and separation of the foundry business to improve the bottom line and drive share prices higher. Prominent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of INTC by 36.1% from the stock’s last closing price of $21.14. Analysts have set the highest price target at $66, an upside of 212.2%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, Arm Holdings plc ARM has disrupted Intel’s server and networking space. At the same time, Intel has lost ground over its competitor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD which has progressed in manufacturing high-performance processing machinery.\n\nIntel’s current expensive valuation also doesn’t justify its struggles. Per the price/earnings, the INTC stock presently trades at 81.3X forward earnings. However, the industry’s forward earnings multiple is 47.7X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, investors should be cautious before buying the INTC stock since it’s still a risky bet. Those invested in the INTC stock should stick to it since the company has a huge upside once it becomes the American version of TSMC, and the recent deals pay off.\n\nThe company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) received a rare Wall Street downgrade on Monday over concerns the tech giant's AI lead is diminishing while it has become too reliant on Nvidia (NVDA) for its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy, keeping their price target unchanged at $475, still implying around an 8% upside from current levels.\n\nThe firm noted that Microsoft's early investments and commercial product rollouts initially gave the company an advantage over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG), who it said were both \"caught flat-footed.\"\n\nSince then, Amazon and Google \"have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think you can start telling that they've caught up,\" Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance on Monday (video above).\n\n\"Going forward, we think AWS [Amazon Web Services] and GCP [Google Cloud Platform] actually have an advantage over [Microsoft] Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU — something Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.\"\n\nCiting their own hyperscaler semiconductor data, the analysts at D.A Davidson said Microsoft is \"beholden\" to Nvidia, its supplier of AI chips.\n\n\"Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders,\" Luria said.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley recently reported, Microsoft has embarked on broad push to infuse its vast portfolio of business software products with AI capabilities as it seeks to outpace rivals in the space and monetize its enormous investments in AI technology.\n\nThe company has been plowing cash into building out its AI data centers, with its latest quarterly capital expenditures topping out at $19 billion, up 35% from the prior quarter.\n\nMicrosoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its cloud Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.\n\nDespite Monday's downgrade, Microsoft shares were trading mostly flat. The stock, which topped in July, is up roughly 15% year-to-date.

        "content": "Microsoft's AI Lead Shrinks: Analyst Downgrades Stock As Amazon And Google Close The Gap\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded the rating on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Neutral from Buy while maintaining a price target of $475.\n\nLuria noted competition has essentially caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation.\n\nThe analyst now ranked Microsoft fourth within the Magnificient Six. The stock increased 92% since his January 2023 initiation, compared to 49% for the S&P500.\n\nLuria noted that Microsoft has accelerated growth and extended margins over the last few quarters as the first to embrace and commercialize generative AI. Through an early investment in OpenAI and the ability to quickly deploy capabilities within Azure and GitHub, it took a significant lead over Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which translated to superior results over the prior 4-6 quarters.\n\nThe analyst noted that Microsoft’s lead is now diminished in both the cloud and code generation businesses, making it difficult for Microsoft to continue to outperform.\n\nLuria said AWS is already adding nearly as much cloud business as Azure after a few quarters of Microsoft adding more business. Google Cloud Platform’s expansion has also seen its business accelerate to comparable growth rates as Azure prior quarter.\n\nThe analyst’s new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in deploying their silicon into their data centers, giving them a significant advantage over Azure in the future.\n\nWhile Microsoft has discussed its Maia chips, it is years behind Amazon and Google and seems to be using them only to run Azure OpenAI Services workloads, he flagged. Luria noted this means Microsoft has been escalating an arms race it may not be able to prevail. He said this makes Microsoft beholden to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which means it will continue to shift wealth from its shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.\n\nAfter significant margin expansion last year, Microsoft is now guiding for a decline in operating margins to pay for the data center capex, increasing from 12% to 21% of revenue, Luria emphasized. This is a higher rate of increase than Amazon and Google due to Microsoft’s greater reliance on Nvidia.\n\nThe analyst said that Microsoft overinvests at these rates yearly, diminishing margins by at least 100 bps cumulatively. To offset the margin drag, Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment.\n\nWhile Nvidia and others have pointed to a strong ROI for hyperscalers such as Azure, Luria flagged that these returns may only last for a while.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst noted Azure’s growth may be boosted by self-funded revenue, such as from OpenAI.\n\nLuria noted Microsoft has also lost much of the lead for GitHub Copilot. Not only have Amazon and Gitlab mostly caught up to GitHub Copilot’s capabilities, he said Cursor has become the new standard.\n\nLuria projected fiscal first-quarter 2025 revenue of $64.2 billion and EPS of $2.96.\n\nPrice Action: MSFT stock is down 0.50% at $433.10 at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for MSFT\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Citigroup Maintains Buy Jan 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for MSFT\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The chipmaker also missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings, citing challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to increase production of its AI chips.\n\nHowever, shares ticked higher last week, after Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced in a memo to staff that it had agreed a deal to make custom chips for Amazon's (AMZN) web services business.\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nRupert Murdoch-backed property firm REA Group (REA.AX) has made a third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove, upping its bid to £6.1bn.\n\nIn a statement on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, Rightmove said its board would \"carefully consider\" this increased offer.\n\nRightmove chair Andrew Fisher said: \"Based on the implied value and structure of REA's first and second indicative non-binding proposals, we considered these proposals to be uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected them.\"\n\nHe said the company's board would \"respond to the most recent proposal in due course.\"\n\nOwen Wilson, CEO of REA, said in a statement on the Australian Securities Exchange that the company's increased offer \"provides a combination of immediate value certainty in cash and at the same time gives Rightmove shareholders an increasing opportunity in core digital property and adjacencies where we have much expertise.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"We are genuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove's board and we strongly encourage the Rightmove board to engage,\" he added.\n\nRightmove shares were up nearly 3% on Monday morning, while REA closed its session on the Australian market nearly 3% lower.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"While this will certainly be very encouraging for some [Rightmove] investors, who had seen the value of their holdings plummet from highs reached in January 2022, there is likely to be a push among others to hold out for an even better deal.\"\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nFrench lender BNP Paribas (BNP.PA) announced on Monday that it had signed an agreement to buy HSBC's private banking arm in Germany.\n\nBNP said it expected this deal to close during the second quarter of 2025 and that it would bring the bank's assets under management to more than €40bn (£33.4m).\n\nHSBC shares were up more than 1% on Monday morning, while BNP Paribas was down nearly 3%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Sunday that HSBC's exposure to defaulted commercial property loans in Hong Kong had risen by nearly six times in the first half of this year to more than $3.2bn.\n\nRead more: Pound eases against dollar after hitting 30-month high\n\nThe report highlighted how the downturn in commercial property in Hong Kong was starting to impact banks.\n\nA spokesperson for HSBC had not replied to Yahoo Finance UK's request for a response at the time of writing.\n\nCommerzbank (CBK.DE)\n\nThe German government announced on Friday it would keep its 12% stake in the bank.

        "title": "Nvidia gets almost half its revenue from just 4 customers. Here's who they might be",
        "content": "When Nvidia (NVDA) reported $30 billion in revenue in its second-quarter earnings results, the AI chipmaker disclosed that almost half of that came from only four customers.\n\nWhile the customers are anonymous in Nvidia’s 10-Q regulatory filing, “Customer A” made up 14% of Nvidia’s revenue, while two customers made up 11%, and the fourth made up 10%. Those sales — representing about 46% of its revenue, or $13.8 billion — “were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment,” the company said.\n\n“We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,” Nvidia said in the filing.\n\nNvidia’s top buyers are likely to include Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — major players in the generative artificial intelligence boom. Even ChatGPT-maker OpenAI could be one.\n\nHere’s what each of these companies, believed to be among Nvidia’s top customers, are doing with its high-in-demand AI chips.\n\nAlphabet Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the Google I/O 2017 Conference on May 17, 2017 in Mountain View, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Google-parent Alphabet reported sales of nearly $85 billion for the second quarter — smashing Wall Street’s expectations by $840 million.\n\n“Our strong performance this quarter highlights ongoing strength in Search and momentum in Cloud,” chief executive Sundar Pichai said in a statement. Alphabet’s Cloud revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time, while its operating profit was over $1 billion.\n\n“Our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers,” Pichai said.\n\nAnd while AI Overviews, the AI search feature rolled out to Google Search in May, initially went awry, generating wrong and even dangerous information, Pichai said the company had made “great progress,” and increased engagement for users between 18 and 24.\n\nGoogle announced in July it was making its fastest, most cost-efficient model, 1.5 Flash, available in the unpaid version of its Gemini chatbot in over 40 languages and more than 230 countries and territories.\n\nWith 1.5 Flash, Gemini will have “quicker and more helpful responses,” Google said, adding that users would notice improvements to Gemini’s reasoning and image processing abilities.\n\nIn August, Google brought back Gemini’s ability to generate images of people, after having to pause the feature in February, when users pointed out that Gemini was generating historically inaccurate images of people, including racially diverse Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nAmazon Amazon fulfillment center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nMonths after Nvidia unveiled its next-generation, highly sought-after Blackwell chips, Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing provider in the world, “fully transitioned” its order of Nvidia’s Hopper chips for Blackwell because the “window between Grace Hopper and Grace Blackwell was small,” the company told The Financial Times.\n\nIn April, Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy said in an annual letter to shareholders the company is “optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” While Amazon spent about $1.5 billion on Nvidia’s H100 chips in 2023, the company has also built its own chips: Trainium for training its AI models, and Inferentia, a chip for inferencing.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot, internally called “Metis,” to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The chatbot will be accessible through a web browser, and will be powered by one of the company’s internal AI models, Olympus, Business Insider reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter as well as an internal document. Olympus is reportedly more powerful than Amazon’s publicly available AI model, Titan.\n\nWhile Amazon changed the virtual assistant game when it launched Alexa in 2014, the company’s new AI-powered Alexa is not even close to being ready, Fortune reported, citing unnamed former employees. Amazon reportedly doesn’t have enough data nor access to the chips needed to run the large language model (LLM) powering the new version of its virtual assistant. It has also reportedly deprioritized the AI-powered Alexa to focus on building generative AI for its cloud computing unit, AWS.\n\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson told Quartz its former employees are incorrect and uninformed on its current Alexa AI efforts, and that the Amazon Artificial General Intelligence team has access to both in-house Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nIn March, Amazon completed its $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic — its largest investment in an outside company ever.\n\nMeta Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nIn July, Meta released its open-source Llama 3.1 models that it says are its “most capable” to date. The largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, has 405 billion parameters, or the variables a model learns from training data that guide its behavior. Llama 3.1 405B rivals its closed-source competitors from OpenAI and Google in “state-of-the-art capabilities,” including general knowledge, math, and translating languages, Meta said. The release also included upgraded versions of its 8B and 70B models, which were introduced in April.\n\nMeta said it trained the model with over 16,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, or graphics processing units. Meanwhile, Nvidia announced an Nvidia AI Foundry service for enterprises and nation states to build “supermodels” with Llama 3.1 405B.\n\nMeta’s Llama models are used to power its AI chatbot, Meta AI, which is available on Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, told Bloomberg the company is working on Llama 4.\n\nMicrosoft Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella at CES 2024 on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. - Photo: Ethan Miller (Getty Images)\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled “the next wave” of its Copilot artificial intelligence tools in its suite of work apps.\n\nThe AI-powered features include Business Chat, which databases web data, work data, and business data into a new tool called Copilot Pages, where human and AI-generated data can be edited, added to, and shared between work teams. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the new tool was part of his “daily habit.”\n\nMicrosoft also launched Copilot in Excel with Python, making it possible to use the programming language to work with data in Excel with natural language, not coding. The new Copilot also includes AI-enabled features for Powerpoint, Outlook, Word, OneDrive, and Teams, which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has said he uses “a lot.” And the company introduced Copilot agents, or AI assistants, that can be used to automate certain business tasks.\n\nIn March, Business Insider reported that some Microsoft customers were complaining that Copilot was falling short of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. However, employees said Microsoft 365 Copilot had mostly positive feedback, but some customers using older versions of Microsoft’s suite of business tools were expecting the more advanced Copilot to work with it, leading to the unfavorable comparisons with ChatGPT.\n\nIn May, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus PCs, or its laptops equipped with AI hardware and support for AI applications, that would be available from its major laptop partners, including Dell (DELL) and HP (HPQ). The company said in May it had released 30 “responsible AI” tools with over 100 features to support AI applications developed by its customers on its Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s shares reached a record high in March after it announced its Copilot for Security tool, which it called the AI industry’s “first generative AI solution” for security and IT professionals; it’s trained on “large-scale data and threat intelligence,” including over 78 trillion security signals that the company processes daily, Microsoft said.\n\nTesla Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. - Photo: Christian Marquardt - Pool (Getty Images)\n\nTesla, which its founder and chief executive Elon Musk has touted as an AI company, has worked on its Full Self-Driving (FSD) tech for years. The electric vehicle company has been accused of exaggerating its driver-assistance system, but in July, analysts said its latest update was encouraging.\n\n“There have been 90+ updates to the FSD system in the last four years, and fully autonomous Teslas still don’t exist,” Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote. But “judging by user reviews on the X platform, version 12.5 is revolutionary.”\n\nIn September, Tesla unveiled its Actually Smart Summon feature for its S3XY electric vehicles. The feature allows Tesla owners to order their car to drive to their location or another destination via the Tesla app. Another feature, called Dumb Summon, allows owners to move their vehicle forward or backward through the app.\n\nTesla also has a humanoid robot called Optimus in development, which it put on display at China’s World Artificial Intelligence Conference in July. The second-generation robot, which is not yet at full-scale production, is “capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring,” the company says. In June, Musk claimed that robots will eventually power the company to a $30 trillion market cap.\n\nMusk, who also founded an AI startup called xAI, announced in September that its training cluster, called Colossus, is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units, or GPUs, and is expected to double in size to 200,000 chips, including 50,000 of Nvidia’s more powerful H200 chips, “in a few months.” In July, he posted a poll on his social media platform X, asking if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, “assuming the valuation is set by several credible outside investors.”\n\nOpenAI OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during OpenAI DevDay on November 6, 2023 in San Francisco, California. - Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nWhen it released ChatGPT in November 2022, AI startup OpenAI kicked off the current generative AI boom that has seen major tech companies, including its partner, Microsoft, spend billions on Nvidia’s chips. Despite its startup status, OpenAI is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the race, with its models consistently outperforming those of its competitors.\n\nIn September, OpenAI released its series of “reasoning models” that it said can “think” through problems before responding — “much like a person would.” The model series, which is available now as o1-preview through ChatGPT and the company’s API, can handle more complex tasks and problems in science, coding, and math than earlier OpenAI models. The company also announced OpenAI o1-mini, a smaller and cheaper version of the new model, which can help developers with coding tasks.\n\nIn May, the startup released a flagship model called GPT-4o, which it called a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction.” The model can accept combinations of text, audio, images, and videos, and generate combinations of text, audio, and images, OpenAI said. The company added that the new model was 50% cheaper and twice as fast as its predecessor, GPT-4 turbo.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in March that he thought its GPT-4 model “kind of sucks.” However, he said ChatGPT-4o “feels like magic to me.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design​. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets – over 20% – to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\n\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\n\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Latest reports suggest that the e-commerce giant is slowly rolling out an artificial intelligence tool designed to help third-party sellers quickly resolve issues with their accounts and fetch sales and inventory data. In an announcement made last week, the company detailed that it was launching the new product, named Amelia, for select US sellers. Amelia is the latest addition to a series of generative AI tools launched by Amazon in the past year, like an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus and a chatbot for businesses dubbed Q.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney recently raised the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $240 from $225 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. In a research note, the analyst noted that Amazon had ramped up its content on Prime Video with more NFL games, 66 regular season NBA games in 2025 and the 2024 PPA World Championships and monetizing that content via advertising had become a higher priority. Evercore estimated that APV would generate between $3 billion and $5.9 billion in total revenue for the tech giant in 2025, implying 3% to 9% incrementality to the FY24 Amazon ad revenue estimate of $56 billion.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 63% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Amazon.com's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company Insider ownership in Amazon.com is 11%\n\nEvery investor in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Amazon.com's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 8.8%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory continues\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$214b stake in this US$2.0t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amazon.com. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\n\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff offers up this reminder to investors before his big birthday",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI think I have fully processed my time spent at Salesforce's (CRM) annual extravaganza in San Francisco, known as Dreamforce.\n\nThis was my fourth Dreamforce, and it was fascinating per usual — including a dinner at the top of the 61-floor Salesforce Tower with Matthew McConaughey (a longtime friend and pitchman for the SaaS giant), Will.i.Am, Metallica lead drummer Lars Ulrich, one of Nvidia's (NVDA) founding GPU creators, and Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei (who gave some great brief remarks on artificial intelligence).\n\nThis dinner ended with an acoustic performance by Alanis Morissette, who sang four songs that reminded me that, at one point over the last 42 years, I did have a personal life (filled with the teenage heartbreak that only fed my appetite for sappy Alanis songs on Myspace).\n\nI digress.\n\nNow that I've digested this latest West Coast tech swing, I'm here to say it's good to see Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff back to being Marc Benioff.\n\nI realize that as a journalist, I'm supposed to be critical, and I am. Salesforce shocked the hell out of the market in late May with a weak outlook, and the stock got hammered. Not a lovely look.\n\nBut I can't completely turn off the analyst DNA in me that still exists deep down.\n\nAnd on that score, I liked what I saw from Benioff at Dreamforce from a few different perspectives.\n\nI saw a founder pull thousands of employees into his vision of an AI future during a keynote. The room full of \"trailblazers\" — as Salesforce employees are called — was hanging on to his every word. The group was ready to run through a wall for Benioff, essential when you are trying to deploy a billion autonomous AI agents and deliver for Wall Street each quarter.\n\nIt was also significant that Benioff mostly did the keynote himself, only yielding the mic a few times.\n\n\"The reason is I think he feels that this is a very pivotal moment for his company, for the industry, and for the technology,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan — who was also in attendance — told me.\n\n\"When these entrepreneurs like Marc and Oracle's Larry Ellison that have founded their companies and have this deep sense of connection to the companies, and they understand those pivotal moments, it is like they kick into high gear and all they can think about is getting the company to be on the right side of technology.\"\n\nStory continues Salesforce co-founder & CEO Marc Benioff gives his keynote address at Dreamforce 2024. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nI saw a founder deeply engaged in the products he was pitching to the masses — not reading off talking points supplied by team members. Benioff even turned the tables and quizzed me on the Opening Bid podcast about what I learned from a product demo at the event. You can catch that exchange in the above video.\n\nIf he thought he was going to catch this fella flat-footed, hell no! Forever prepared!\n\nI saw a founder perhaps doing what very few in corporate America could do: bring together huge names to drive meaningful discussions, which often transformed into convos about Salesforce innovations and their longtime personal ties with Benioff.\n\nBenioff has one of the most extensive networks I've seen, and trust me, that has paid dividends for Salesforce in terms of reputation, business wins, and getting things done quickly.\n\n\"Marc can turn this ship like no one else when he gets an idea in his head,\" one Benioff confidant told me at the Salesforce Tower dinner.\n\nBy all indications, Benioff is back to aggressively driving that huge Salesforce boat — shaking off the activist attacks that transpired a little while back.\n\n\"If I'm not enjoying it — I'm not doing it, and I think that I'm really enjoying Salesforce. I love it. I feel like we've done seminal work, especially in the last 18 months. We've gotten the company to the point where it is an absolute leader, where everyone is having to respond,\" Benioff remarked when asked to reflect ahead of his big 60th birthday on Sept. 25.\n\nSo all this raises the question: Why isn't there more optimism priced into Salesforce's stock?\n\nIts shares trade on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 25 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. Microsoft (MSFT) trades at 33 times, whereas Oracle (ORCL) (Ellison is a mentor of Benioff's dating back to his time at the company) is at 27 times. Salesforce quasi-rival ServiceNow (NOW) trades on a 53 times forward multiple.\n\nPros tell me the Street is generally worried about Salesforce's propensity to spend big on acquisitions, which weighed on margins and free cash flow in the past. Others still aren't sold on Salesforce monetizing its new AI initiatives.\n\nBut they all generally agree that the stock does appear cheap on a relative and historical basis.\n\n\"I would go far enough to say that not much optimism [at all] is being priced into Salesforce's stock right now,\" Rangan said. \"The stock is pricing in as if there is no growth at all, which is absolutely ridiculous. So not only AI optimism is not priced in, there's no optimism being priced in.\"\n\nSalesforce's guidance calls for sales growth of 7% this year and up to 25% operating cash flow growth, FYI.\n\n\"I'm very optimistic about this company,\" Rangan said. \"People tend to dismiss Marc — but I'm a big bull on the company.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Fed's preferred inflation gauge and second quarter GDP: What to know this week",
        "content": "The rate cut that everyone was waiting for finally arrived. Markets offered a resoundingly positive response to the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign. But the euphoria was only fleeting. Friday's trading brought fresh concerns over corporate earnings and economic growth.\n\nStocks, however, still posted overall wins for the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended the week up about 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 1.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 1.5%. While Friday brought down the S&P, the index notched an all-time high earlier in the week and the Dow closed with a record.\n\nThe biggest question for investors this upcoming week is whether a new batch of data supports Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assertion that the US economy remains strong.  A second quarter GDP reading due Thursday will help test that contention.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell was also careful not to declare a victory over inflation as pricing pressures continue to come down. Friday's scheduled release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will offer another progress report on that front.\n\nQuarterly earnings reports from Costco (COST), Micron (MU), and Accenture (ACN) are also on deck.\n\nWhat's next for the Fed?\n\nThe quiet period is over and so is the tightening. The public is set to receive fresh commentary from Fed officials in the days after the momentous shift away from a restrictive monetary policy. Perhaps the biggest question for policymakers is, where do we go from here?\n\nAt least eight central bank officials, including Powell, Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr, and New York Fed chief John Williams, are scheduled to offer speeches or participate in conferences in the days ahead, likely giving color to the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Fed members see two more 25 basis point cuts this year, followed by four more in 2025.\n\nPowell has said the central bank was not playing catch-up in opting for a larger rate cut, addressing criticism that the Fed should have eased rates at their last policy huddle in July. He's also stated that cuts of 50 basis points shouldn't be thought of as the new norm. But a greater slowdown in the labor market could challenge both of his contentions.\n\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThe new risks and the old\n\nInflation was so high and the job market so tight that curbing price increases was the Fed's sole focus over the last two years. But now that inflation is cooling and the job market showing signs of slowing, the Fed has to advance its mandate on both fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday Powell noted the upside risks to inflation have diminished while the downside risks to employment have increased. \"We know it is time to recalibrate our policy,\" he said, confirming that the balance of risks is \"now even.\"\n\nAnalysts expect Friday's PCE reading to come in at 2.3% year over year, down from the prior month's 2.5% annual increase, according to Bloomberg data. Such a favorable metric would continue a downward climb and affirm the Fed's decision making. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut even as more eyes are on the labor market, the Fed still hasn't met its inflation goal of 2%. And as central bankers have reiterated, stepping off the brakes too early could allow heightened inflation to pick back up.\n\nAs Bank of America Global Research analysts put it in a note on Friday, \"With above-potential growth, a strong consumer, and a record-breaking stock market, such a bold start to an easing cycle is hard to justify if a recession isn't imminent.\"\n\n\"Unless the Fed is seeing something that we are missing, a more aggressive easing cycle could make reaching the 2% target harder considering uncertainty ahead, including the aftermath of US elections,\" they wrote.\n\nTech stock reset\n\nTech investors have been on the hunt for their next catalyst, and the Fed may have just handed it to them. After a mixed earnings season where Wall Street largely soured on massive AI spending and flashed impatience for less-than-perfect quarters, the rate-sensitive sector could revert back to growth mode.\n\nAll but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks posted gains last week, with Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) all outpacing the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA), the sole loser, shed more than 2% last week as it grapples with volatility after a stunning spring and summer rise. Still, some analysts see a more nuanced picture. As Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert warned, the upside of even the most high-flying tech stocks is limited as the ability to match their prior growth becomes more difficult.

I can’t believe, when I come down here, the empty buildings. The people who work for you not going to the office,” he stated,\n\n“That bothers me,” he added. Dimon emphasized that he does not allow such flexibility at JPMorgan.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nWhy It Matters: Dimon is not alone in his stance. Earlier this week, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon employees would return to the office five days a week, reverting to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nJPMorgan’s policy mandates managing directors to be in the office full-time, while other employees must work in person at least three days a week. Last year, the Biden Administration also pushed federal employees to return to in-person work.\n\nDespite these efforts, many federal workers still have flexible work arrangements. For instance, some Environmental Protection Agency employees are required to be in the office only four days a month. Other agencies, like the Department of the Treasury and the Department of the Interior, require at least 50% in-office presence.\n\nOffice vacancy rates in DC remain high, with about 22% of office space empty in the second quarter of 2024, according to CBRE. The federal government and private-sector offices contribute to this trend.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today. SmartAsset’s free toolmatches you up with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Take Advantage of the Next Wave of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Investing",
        "content": "Nvidia has been the king of the first wave of artificial intelligence (AI) investing. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are being purchased by the truckload by the biggest cloud computing and AI modeling companies. Eventually, if they have all the computing power they want, Nvidia's business would decline as new computing capacity wouldn't be needed.\n\nThis will give way to the next wave of AI investments, and if you're looking to cash in on this trend, I've got three companies that are slated to do well.\n\nCloud computing is going to grow tremendously\n\nThe next wave will benefit companies currently training and developing AI models or those offering cloud computing services to companies developing AI. The major cloud computing players are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). As the industry leaders, they have been some of the largest purchasers of Nvidia's GPUs in recent quarters.\n\nAll three also have affiliations with generative AI models, with Amazon and Microsoft investing in and partnering with Anthropic and Open AI, respectively. Alphabet is developing its generative AI model, Gemini, in-house. With all three companies having strong ties to top-tier generative AI models, they have properly positioned themselves to provide users with the tools they need to create AI models.\n\nHowever, having a generative AI model for cloud computing clients is just table stakes for a much larger game. Many workloads are still processed on-site at businesses around the globe. While some of these workloads may never migrate to the cloud, a large majority will. This is why the cloud computing market opportunity is expected to increase from $676 billion in 2024 to $2.3 trillion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nBecause it is easy to scale up or down the computing power you rent in the cloud, it is ideal for training in-house AI models, as businesses don't have to buy expensive computing power from companies like Nvidia permanently. With the general trend toward the cloud being accelerated by AI demand, it's clear this will be a huge investment trend.\n\nBut does that make all three stocks buys?\n\nAll three stocks have unique price points\n\nThe wrinkle with each of these companies is that cloud computing isn't the only thing they do. While cloud computing continues to be one of the best (if not the best) performing segments in each of these businesses, other core businesses steer the stocks. Additionally, the prices you must pay for the stocks vary widely.\n\nStory continues AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAmazon is the most expensive, but that's because it has the most potential in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud computing. But because Amazon's ancillary businesses are all fairly low-margin, AWS accounts for 64% of its operating profit despite only contributing 18% of revenue. This means that if AWS sees brisk growth, Amazon's profits will quickly rise, decreasing Amazon's expensive valuation rapidly.\n\nAlthough Amazon technically is more expensive from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, I'd argue that Microsoft is the most expensive. Its business has steadily grown revenue, but its profit margins have remained relatively flat. As a result, there really isn't any big upside for Microsoft; it must maintain its status quo to retain its premium price tag. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nLast is Alphabet, which is actually cheaper than the broader market (measured by the S&P 500, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings). Alphabet doesn't have the premium valuation of its peers because it has been behind on several key product launches, but that doesn't mean it can't be a solid investment. Alphabet has much to gain from its cloud computing wing because it is just starting to turn profitable and could be a huge boost to profits as it moves toward AWS-like margins.\n\nAll three cloud computing businesses have merits, but Amazon and Alphabet stand out as better investment options than Microsoft right now, solely based on their potential to grow profits.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "Investors with huge portfolios can afford to focus on a stock's valuation without thinking about the price of one share. Warren Buffett is in that group. After all, the portfolio he manages for Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a cash position of $277 billion.\n\nHowever, many investors have limited cash to put to work. Share prices matter to them quite a bit.\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of great stocks to buy if you're on a budget. Several of them can be found in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Here are my picks for the best Buffett stocks to buy with $500 right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nUntil a couple of years ago, buying only one share of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) would have been impossible for investors with only $500. However, the company's 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022 made it much more affordable. Today, you can get a share for around $188.\n\nMost Americans probably know Amazon best for its e-commerce business. The company is the 800-pound gorilla in this market, delivering millions of products across the world every day.\n\nI expect its e-commerce business to continue growing. However, it's not the main reason to buy the stock, in my opinion. That honor belongs to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud services business.\n\nAWS is already the market leader among cloud services providers. It contributed roughly 16.5% of Amazon's total net sales in the second quarter of 2024 and nearly 70% of its operating income. With the massive tailwind generated by artificial intelligence (AI), I think the shift of spending to the cloud will accelerate over the next decade.\n\n2. Lennar\n\nHomebuilder Lennar(NYSE: LEN) is only a tiny position in Berkshire Hathaway's massive portfolio. However, Buffett has wisely (in my view) held on to the stock. Lennar won't break your budget, either, with its share price of around $187.\n\nWhy buy Lennar stock? One reason is valuation (and I'm not talking about share price here). It trades at 12.8 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is well below the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF's earnings multiple of 18.2.\n\nAnother great reason, though, is its strong growth prospects. A June 2024 report from Zillow said that the U.S. needs another 4.5 million homes. As one of the largest homebuilders in the country, Lennar should profit by helping address this housing shortage.\n\nLower interest rates should also help Lennar. The Federal Reserve's rate cut will likely provide an incentive for more Americans to buy new homes.\n\n3. Occidental Petroleum\n\nBuying one share each of Amazon and Lennar would leave you with roughly $125 remaining from your initial $500. That's enough to pick up two shares of Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) at around $52 each and still have some money left over.\n\nStory continues\n\nOccidental is without question one of Buffett's favorite stocks. How do we know this for sure? For one thing, he has been aggressively buying the oil stock since 2022. It now ranks as the sixth-largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The legendary investor also wrote to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year that it is one of a handful of stocks he plans to own \"indefinitely.\"\n\nIf you're the type of investor who likes to \"bet on the jockey,\" you'll probably find Occidental attractive. Buffett praised the company's CEO, Vicki Hollub, in the Berkshire shareholder letter, saying that she knows \"how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\"\n\nAnd that brings us to arguably the main reason to buy the stock: The demand for oil and gas isn't going away. In his latest letter to shareholders, Buffett applauded Occidental for its \"leadership in carbon-capture initiatives.\" I think that these carbon-capture and storage initiatives could be a game changer for the company in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Beating the Market This Year and Can Still Go Higher",
        "content": "It has been a fairly solid year for the markets in 2024 as the S&P 500 has risen by around 18% thus far. However, it's not hard to find stocks that have done even better. A good place to look is in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, which invests in many of the world's top stocks. You'll find many quality, safe stocks to own for the long term. And some of them have been solidly outperforming the market.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS), and American Express (NYSE: AXP) are among the brightest investments in Berkshire's portfolio this year. These are the types of investments you can hang on to for not only years but decades. Here's how they've been doing thus far and why they can still soar higher.\n\nAmazon\n\nThis e-commerce and tech giant is not a big holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, accounting for just 0.6% of the portfolio's overall weight. But it has been one of the better-performing stocks there, with its value rising by 21% since the start of the year.\n\nThe stock has benefited from the hype in artificial intelligence (AI) as the company has invested in chatbot-maker Anthropic and it plans to invest a whopping $100 billion over the next decade to focus on its data center infrastructure. Data centers are going to be growing in importance in the future as more companies go to the cloud and develop AI models.\n\nOn the e-commerce side of things, Amazon is also launching a new discount service to better compete with cheap online retailers such as Shein and Temu (which PDD Holdings owns). That can potentially boost its growth rate, which was at 10% in the company's most recent quarter as sales topped $148 billion for the period ending June 30.\n\nDespite all these positive investments and potential catalysts, Amazon's stock still trades at a fairly modest 44 times earnings, which is a bit unusual for a stock for which investors normally pay a much higher premium. It may only be a matter of time before the stock rallies even more.\n\nT-Mobile US\n\nUp 28% this year, T-Mobile is another stock which has been doing well of late. The telecom company has been posting some strong numbers this year. In its most recent quarter, T-Mobile reported its highest postpaid phone net customer additions in its history at 777,000 and it hit a milestone of 100 million postpaid customers in total.\n\nThere should be even more growth on the horizon for the company as it plans to acquire the majority of U.S. Cellular for $4.4 billion, which will expand its coverage in rural areas. T-Mobile acquired Sprint in 2020 for the much more massive price tag of $26 billion. T-Mobile's consistent pursuit of growth and success in winning over customers makes it one of the better telecom stocks to own in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nT-Mobile accounts for an even smaller stake in Berkshire's portfolio than Amazon at just 0.3%. But its strong brand and its position among the industry leaders suggests it belongs there and is the type of Buffett stock you can safely hold onto for years.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nThe top-performing stock on this list is American Express. The credit card stock has risen by around 40% since the beginning of the year. Buffett is a fan of the big credit card companies, but Amex is special as it is the second-largest holding behind Apple, accounting for 13% of Berkshire's portfolio (Apple is at 28%). Like the iPhone maker, Amex's focus on a more affluent and less price-sensitive customer base has undoubtedly helped make it a good buy this year.\n\nRevenue net of interest expense is up 10% this year for Amex, totaling $32.1 billion over six months. More impressively, the company's net income has risen by 37% to $5.5 billion. The performance has been strong enough to warrant an increase in the guidance; Amex now expects its full-year earnings per share to come in around a midpoint of $13.55 versus the $12.90 it was forecasting previously.\n\nAmex has been doing well this year, and its strong customer base could help it to continue delivering impressive results even if the economy struggles, making it an ideal option for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Have $500? 2 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Just because the stock market is near all-time highs doesn't mean all stocks are expensive. Sure, you might refer to the stock market as a thing, but it's really a collection of thousands of companies -- each with its own story. You could say that Wall Street isn't a stock market, but a market of stocks.\n\nIn other words, there is always a deal somewhere. You just have to know where to look.\n\nHere are two growth stocks trading at compelling prices. One trades near all-time highs, and the other has fallen 65% from its peak. You can own shares of both companies for less than $500 today.\n\nHere is the story behind each one.\n\n1. An e-commerce giant trading near all-time highs\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is already a historically lucrative investment. Yet, today, the stock has more to offer despite Amazon's nearly $2 trillion market cap. Amazon is the top U.S. online retailer with 38% market share, and the top global cloud platform with 31%. The great thing is that both businesses still have more growth ahead. E-commerce is still just 16% of total retail in the U.S., and Amazon still has a long road ahead in underpenetrated niches like grocery and pharmacy. Meanwhile, the global cloud market is poised to grow due to artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization, as companies shift from on-premise computer systems to the cloud.\n\nAnalysts believe Amazon can grow earnings by an average of 27% annually for the next three to five years. Today, the stock trades at 39 times Amazon's estimated 2024 earnings. That forward price-to-earnings is an attractive price point for a company growing its bottom line this fast. Additionally, suppose you value the stock by its operating cash flow, which gives investors a look at Amazon's profits before it reinvests in the business. In that case, the valuation is near a decade low.\n\nAmazon stock is trading within shouting distance of all-time highs. But fundamentally speaking, long-term investors still have an opportunity to acquire a wonderful business at an attractive price today.\n\n2. This energy drink brand has fallen from its lofty perch\n\nEnergy drink brand Monster is a famously successful stock, but Celsius(NASDAQ: CELH), an up-and-coming energy drink brand, has emerged to challenge Monster's market share and stock returns. Celsius has exploded in popularity over the past five years, resulting in more than 6,000% investment returns at the stock's peak. However, the stock has fallen 65% from those highs, and now investors must decide whether the company's fundamentals can lift Celsius stock back to its former glory.\n\nStory continues\n\nUltimately, Celsius enjoyed rampant growth during the pandemic's height. Then PepsiCo invested in the company and helped Celsius expand its distribution, further turbo-charging growth. However, this growth spurt has ended, and revenue growth slowed sharply this year, explaining the stock's struggles.\n\nIt's fair that the stock would earn a lower valuation as growth slows, but Celsius could now be approaching a point that interests investors again. The company is still taking market share -- Celsius grew sales by 23% year over year in the second quarter in an industry growing at a low-single-digit rate. Celsius is highly profitable, and analysts believe it will grow its earnings by an average of 16% annually for the next three to five years.\n\nThe company's stock trades at a forward P/E of 40 today. That valuation and growth rate produce roughly the same price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio Monster trades at today. Yet, Celsius is the company taking market share in the U.S., and it has a tremendous opportunity in international markets.\n\nThe stock's decline has made Celsius an attractive long-term idea worth considering today. Still, it's impossible to call a bottom on a declining stock, so investors who believe in Celsius' long-term potential should buy shares slowly to avoid jumping in too aggressively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): ‘Intel Corporation Entered A Deal With Cloud Computing Giant Amazon Web Services to Produce Custom AI Semiconductors’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Don’t Miss Out: Jim Cramer’s 10 Key Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other key stocks to watch.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce, to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what’s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There’s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That’s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\"\n\nUnlocking Profit Potential with Lower Rates and AI\n\nJim Cramer stated that today's market movements show it's possible to navigate unpredictable conditions. He emphasized that we don't need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to decrease, which is essential for maintaining a bull market. He advised against overthinking the situation and suggested focusing on profitable opportunities, particularly the growing importance of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don’t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that’s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I’d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that while AI is generating excitement in the stock market, its impact on the broader economy has been limited. There are some practical applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. This is why many analysts are starting to label the hype around AI as a bubble.\n\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We’ve heard so much about this technology and how it’s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn’t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings—nothing flashy. That’s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI, especially when combined with advanced computing from chipmakers, significantly speeds up processes and enables machines to act intelligently, similar to capable humans. He noted that businesses aim to create quality products for consumers, but a shortage of workers has become a major issue, particularly highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This has led to sales associates being too busy to engage effectively with customers, resulting in rushed and confusing interactions.\n\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Business wants to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes—that’s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\n\nThat became apparent during COVID. We can’t interact effectively because our sales associates are too busy to be anything but brisk or confused. They’re harried from the moment they come in to the moment they leave. It’s a late-stage capitalist directive. What can I say? What doctor has time to talk to you? What nurse practitioner can give you the time of day?\"\n\nTransforming Customer Service with Superior AI Agents\n\nCramer pointed out that companies are pushing their employees hard to boost profits, which can create a stressful environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, he recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage with customers politely, and efficiently answering common questions by using personalized data.\n\nCramer argued that AI is an ideal solution for customer service, as it can provide clear and friendly assistance without the frustrations that often come from human employees who are overwhelmed and eager to leave. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries on their own.\n\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond your data. It knows your preferences.\n\nThis is the perfect way to handle customer interactions instead of relying on humans who can be unclear, impatient, or exhausted. Humans are, well, human, harried and ready to go home. But machines infused with AI are delightful, smart, and engaging. They don’t mind going to work, and that’s where these AI agents come in. The machines can listen, reason, and either direct you to the right place or handle everything themselves.\"\n\nJim Cramer explained that AI offers a better experience than what we currently have. For instance, in retail, AI knows customer preferences, helps with returns, and suggests alternatives based on previous purchases, reducing the need to deal with human salespeople who might be stressed or impatient. If customers are still unhappy, they can opt to talk to a human, but they might prefer the friendly interaction with the AI agent.\n\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It’s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you’re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to—but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\n\nRevolutionizing Everyday Life: How AI Outperforms Humans in Healthcare, Driving, and Beyond\n\nCramer added that AI's potential extends beyond retail. He believes that in ten years, we might wonder why we relied on doctors when AI agents could provide kinder, more empathetic care. These AI systems could analyze millions of test results, quickly identifying serious health issues like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer, making it easier to spot dangerous patterns before they become serious problems. AI's ability to compile and analyze data effectively is key to this advancement.\n\n\"It’s not just retail. In ten years, I think we’ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor’s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic—like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It’s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer pointed out that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He noted that AI can also handle tasks like proofreading and correcting errors without making mistakes. This efficiency allows law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They’re much safer than human drivers. They don’t drink and drive—they don’t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\n\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents often perform better than humans in most situations. For repetitive tasks, he believes it's preferable to interact with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed or frustrated human who may not want to engage.\n\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you’d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn’t want to deal with you.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, highlighting ten key stocks he reviewed. We ranked them by hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investor: 308\n\nJim Cramer shared that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has struck a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom AI semiconductors. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a major customer of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), uses its chips to power its AWS servers.\n\n\"Intel Corporation entered a deal with cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services to produce custom AI semiconductors. Amazon is a big customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers.\"\n\nA positive outlook on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is through its strong earnings growth, expansion in cloud services, and strategic investments in logistics and AI. In its latest quarterly report, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported impressive revenues of $134.4 billion for Q2 2023, largely driven by its strong performance in e-commerce and AWS (Amazon Web Services), which alone generated $22.1 billion.\n\nAWS continues to thrive despite rising competition, reflecting solid demand for cloud solutions. Additionally,  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s investments in logistics, such as new fulfillment centers and improved delivery technologies, will enhance customer experience and operational efficiency, driving sales growth.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, indicating a change of +34.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon’s RTO mandate leaves working moms behind",
        "content": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Tupperware filed for bankruptcy, Joanna Geraghty’s JetBlue is opening its first airport lounges, and Fortune writer Jane Thier examines how return-to-office mandates like Amazon’s may put women—especially mothers—at a disadvantage.Have a restful weekend.\n\n- The end of flex. On Monday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that employees would be mandated to return to the office five days a week. “Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward,” Jassy wrote in a memo to employees titled “strengthening our culture and teams.”\n\nJassy acknowledged that “some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” but nonetheless, five days is the new expectation come the new year.\n\nIt didn’t go over well.\n\nAfter the news broke, several Amazon employees told Fortune’s Jason Del Rey that they believe the new mandate actively runs counter to the company’s purported people-first mission. It also is likely to create an instant hemorrhage of top talent fleeing the tech giant for employers more amenable to flexibility and choice, workplace experts say.\n\nSome hard-charging companies may be tempted to copy Amazon’s moves, given that it’s “one of the largest private-sector employers in the world, and the second-largest in the U.S.,” Del Rey wrote. “On the other hand, competitors could seize on the mandate to attract talented Amazon workers looking for more flexible work.”\n\nEmployees pointed out that this mandate is harsher than prior to the pandemic. “Please do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-COVID,” one Amazon employee wrote in an internal Slack channel, per a Business Insider report. “I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer wrote on LinkedIn, donning an “#opentowork” halo around his profile picture.\n\nReturn-to-office or “RTO” mandates are near-uniformly unpopular with employees. But the nitty-gritty of RTO mandates are particularly fraught for women—mothers in particular, who most often bear the brunt of caregiving and household upkeep.\n\nNearly two-thirds of C-suite leaders whose companies have mandated an office return say the policy has led a disproportionate number of women to quit, as Kelly Monahan, who directs research at freelancing platform Upwork, told Fortune over the summer. There’s not even an upside for the boss; more than half of executives told Upwork that losing female employees ended up tanking company productivity—the very thing mandates are supposedly designed to boost.\n\nStory continues\n\nNearly nine in 10 women, per a survey by International Workplace Group, believe flexible work is an equalizer; two-thirds say such an arrangement lessens the biases they face. Almost 75% of women said they’d instantly look for a new job if their employer removed their hybrid work plans.\n\nWomen’s day-to-day work experience remains largely unexamined, Annie Dean, workplace futurist and head of Team Anywhere at workplace software firm Atlassian tells Fortune. “There are ‘pinch points’ in various phases of life, especially for working mothers, when the ability to commute and spend the majority of waking hours in an office is impractical,” she added. “But this in no way impacts a woman’s ability to do her highest-level work.”\n\nTo be sure, in-person work is valuable, insofar as it fosters collaboration, idea exchange, and simply getting to know the people one works with day in, day out. But, research has proven time and again, that same value can be fostered without compulsory daily attendance. In fact, Dean points out, daily office attendance, when compared with just a handful of days per week or month in person, actually negatively impacts business performance. Dean calls choices like Amazon’s “especially egregious.”\n\n“There’s nothing that correlates higher in-office time with better performance; in fact it’s the opposite,” Monahan notes. “That doesn’t mean you have to be 100% remote—and women aren’t always asking for that—just time for life outside of work.”\n\nJane Thier\r\njane.thier@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

        "title": "Amazon Is Trying to Kill the Meeting Before the Meeting",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. employees will soon have to schlep to the office all week, but they might have fewer boring meetings when they get there.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density\n\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s memo targeting corporate bloat promised a purge of “pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings,” which he deemed “artifacts that we’d like to change.” In doing so, the technology giant that employs 1.5 million people became the latest big company to try and reduce corporate bureaucracy, a scourge of the workplace that became more pronounced during a pandemic-induced hiring binge.\n\nLarge organizations waste an estimated $100 million a year on needless gatherings. Executives have said that nearly half of those meetings could disappear without any negative impact.\n\nJassy pledged changes that would flatten the organization, saying he wanted employees “feeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.”\n\nSome workplace experts cheered Jassy’s attack on red tape, which also included a promised reduction in management layers and the creation of a “bureaucracy mailbox” where staff can identify processes and rules that “should be called out and extinguished.”\n\nOther management gurus said there can be value in the pre-meetings that Jassy wants to cull.\n\n“I think pre-meetings have upsides and downsides,” said Andy Molinsky, a professor of management and organizational behavior at the Brandeis International Business School. While they eat up time and can be exclusionary, they also help shape and vet ideas, which can increase buy-in and ultimately improve execution, Molinsky said.\n\n“Perhaps Amazon feels things have just gotten too bogged down. The question is whether what they gain outweighs what they might potentially lose,” he said.\n\nOrganizational psychologist Steven Rogelberg, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said pre-meetings can be “a critical part” of some decisions. Even if many are unnecessary, a top-down edict to eliminate them all is misguided, he said.\n\nCultural red flag\n\nStill, a calendar chock full of pre-meetings is a cultural red flag, a sign that employees fear the repercussions of not having all the answers, according to Jennifer Nahrgang, a management professor at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa.\n\nStory continues\n\nTactics for limiting meetings vary: Twice a quarter, for example, Salesforce-owned Slack cancels all internal meetings for an entire week, and eliminates them on Fridays. Shopify Inc. created a tool embedded in employees’ calendars that estimates the cost of each meeting. They can add up: A decade ago, Bain & Co. found that a single weekly meeting of mid-level managers cost one organization $15 million a year.\n\nCutting bureaucracy could add $4.8 trillion to US economic output, according to a new analysis by Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini, the authors of Humanocracy and co-founders of the Management Lab, a research and advisory firm. But initiatives to reduce bureaucracy often fail.\n\n“Every few years a company will go to war with bureaucracy. But like grass in the rain, it grows back, and all you’ve done is given it a trim,” Hamel said. “Like aging, this creeping bureau-sclerosis is inevitable.”\n\n“World’s largest startup”\n\nAmazon’s drive to get leaner follows that of Meta Platforms Inc., where CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year cut thousands of jobs and reportedly railed against “managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work.” Bayer AG chief Bill Anderson has taken a unique approach — modeled in part on Chinese appliance maker Haier — by grouping staffers into small teams that work together for 90 days on a project, then disperse, in a model called “dynamic shared ownership.”\n\nIn Amazon’s case, Jassy said he wants to foster a cultural transformation so the 30-year-old company will “operate like the world’s largest startup.”\n\nBut Hamel noted other CEOs have made similar promises, only to fall flat: Carly Fiorina, upon taking control of Hewlett-Packard in 1999, said she would recapture the spirit of the Palo Alto garage where the company was founded. Six years, a failed merger and thousands of layoffs later, Fiorina was dramatically ousted by HP’s board.\n\nWill the new guard of storied tech startups be any more successful at rescuing their entrepreneurial roots from red tape? According to Hamel, that depends on how they approach the problem.\n\n“Bureaucracy is not just excess layers, it’s a way of thinking,” Hamel said. “There’s great merit in asking if there are too many pointless meetings. But if you really want to recapture the spirit of a startup, that’s a much more radical goal. So my first question for Amazon is, ‘How much are you really willing to change?’”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success How a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison In Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon warehouse workers are finally getting free $140 Prime memberships, but corporate colleagues aren’t",
        "content": "Amazon is delivering a new perk to its warehouse workers—one that’s been a long time coming.\n\nThe e-commerce giant on Wednesday announced that, in addition to increasing front-line workers’ pay by at least $1.50 an hour, the company will also now offer its Prime membership as a perk starting next year.\n\nLaunched in 2005 for $79 a year, Amazon Prime has steadily increased its initial offering of free two-day shipping to include streaming and digital benefits, grocery savings, medical care and prescription benefits, and more. Now boasting a user base of over 180 million U.S. shoppers as of March, Amazon Prime’s price has also ballooned to $14.99 per month, or $139 per year.\n\n“Our front-line team members across our operations are a big part in bringing the magic of Prime to customers, and starting early next year, Prime will become part of their benefits package,” Amazon vice president of worldwide operations Udit Madan wrote in a blog post announcing the new benefits.\n\nThe free Prime membership, however, is exclusive to front-line workers, the company told Fortune. Corporate employees will still need to shell out the full amount to buy their own subscriptions. However, all employees, both logistics and corporate, will continue to receive 10% off Amazon merchandise, up to a maximum discount of $100 per year.\n\nEven with the new boost to an average base wage of more than $22 an hour, Amazon warehouse workers’ pay is still far lower than that of their white-collar colleagues. According to ZipRecruiter, the average Amazon corporate employee brings home $133,000 per year, or about $64 an hour.\n\nAs the No. 2 company on the Fortune 500, Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people and said the new wage increase represents a total investment of more than $2.2 billion in its workforce. When including elected benefits, the new raises bring the average total compensation to $29 an hour, or around $55,000 for a 40-hour workweek.\n\nThe wage hike and work perks come as Amazon prepares for the busy holiday season and an upcoming Prime Day-like sale on Oct. 8-9. The fall sale is the third savings bonanza of its kind this year, with previous events occurring in spring and summer. During July’s Prime Day event, customers spent a record $14.2 billion, an 11% increase from last year, according to sales tracking data from Adobe Analytics.\n\nAmazon also made waves this week after CEO Andy Jassy announced plans to order employees back to the office five days per week. Previously, office workers were required to tap into their buildings at least three days per week, depending on their team requirements. The new full-time requirement, however, will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or for employees whose managers had already approved a fully remote position.\n\nStory continues\n\n“When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff, saying he wants to operate like “the world’s largest startup.”\n\nJassy is also planning to reduce layers of management, which have become bloated in recent years due to dramatic hiring increases, according to employees who spoke withFortune’s Jason Del Rey.\n\nThe return-to-office plan was not met well by some employees, who slammed the new rules in the company’s internal Slack channel, according to Business Insider.\n\nOthers took to LinkedIn in pursuit of new gigs.\n\n“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me,” an Amazon Web Services engineer wrote. “Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@fortune/video/7416445710071008555\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to an unprecedented 42,000 points.\n\nIn the first 30 minutes of trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones rose by 1.4% and 1%, respectively. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.5%, although the Russell 2000, representing small-cap stocks, outperformed with a surge of over 2%.\n\nThe market rally was primarily driven by the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of the Magnificent Seven are recording daily gains ranging from 1.5% to 4.5%, solidly in positive territory.\n\nChart: S&P 500 Hits Record Highs\n\nImage: Benzinga Pro\n\nStrong Labor Market Eases Slowdown Fears, Analysts Boost Rate-Cut Wagers\n\nThursday’s economic data further boosted investor confidence. Weekly jobless claims came in well below expectations, suggesting a lower-than-expected trend of rising unemployment.\n\nContinuing jobless claims also dropped more than expected, hinting at a potential absorption of long-term unemployed individuals into the job market.\n\nThis data alleviated concerns about rising unemployment and provided a more optimistic outlook for the economy.\n\nWall Street analysts quickly adjusted their expectations following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. There is now growing anticipation of additional rate cuts, diverging from the cautious tone expressed in the Fed’s September “dot plot” and Chair Jerome Powell‘s remarks during the press conference.\n\nNotably, Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius revised his forecast from expecting a 25-basis-point cut at every other meeting to predicting a rate cut at every meeting. He even left the door open for a back-to-back 50-basis-point reduction in November.\n\nThursday’s 5 Top-Performing S&P 500 Stocks\n\nAmong the S&P 500, the top five performers as of 10 a.m. ET were:\n\nName 1-day Return Darden Restaurants, Inc.

The cut is expected to boost discretionary spending by the companies.\n\nThe rate cut will be a welcome move, as semiconductor companies have invested heavily in Big Tech (including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)) spending on their artificial intelligence ambitions, which entail substantial capital expenditures.\n\nAlso Read: Super Micro Poised for Expansion as Gross Margin Concerns Ease, Internal Control Risks Priced In: Analyst\n\nThe semiconductor companies are also under pressure due to the U.S. sanctions on China, a crucial market.

        "title": "Amazon adds chatbot for its sellers, boosting automation",
        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com announced on Thursday a new artificial intelligence application that it says will help its independent sellers with sales metrics, inventory maintenance and product advertising, among other things.\n\nThe move is part of a broader Big Tech effort to employ the technology for greater automation.\n\nThe software, dubbed Amelia, can provide instantaneous answers to broad questions such as how to prepare for the holidays and how a seller’s business is performing, including units sold and website traffic.\n\nLater, the company says, the software will be able to help resolve problems of sellers such as delayed shipments without additional human intervention.\n\nIn a demonstration of the software for Reuters, Amazon showed how Amelia can quickly call up metrics for a seller, such as sales data. It also made suggestions for preparing for major sales holidays, including promotions and buying advertising on Amazon.com.\n\nAmelia is meant to give sellers “their own personalized expert in selling on Amazon,” said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of worldwide selling partner services at Amazon. “It needs to be a deep expert in all these kind of core parts of running your selling business.”\n\nAmazon, which relies on third-parties to supply more than three out of every five units it sells, has had an at-times testy relationship with sellers, particularly over fees.\n\nBy automating some of the seller customer service, Amazon may be able to more inexpensively handle complaints and other difficulties that would otherwise require human intervention.\n\nThe Seattle retailer announced Amelia during its annual conference in its hometown where many of its roughly 450,000 U.S. independent sellers converge for tips and tricks, and to learn about new products and services.\n\nAmelia follows the announcement earlier this year of Rufus, a generative AI search engine Amazon added to its website to help customers find more products. Amazon has since started selling advertising within Rufus, suggesting it may let marketers pay in exchange for the software’s recommendation.\n\nIt has also rolled out a corporate chatbot and is working to improve its Alexa voice assistant by updating it with a more conversational AI.\n\nAmazon boosted capital expenditure in this year’s second quarter to about $16.5 billion from $14 billion in the first quarter, driven in large part by AI investments.\n\nSince the release in late 2022 of ChatGPT, Silicon Valley has seen an investing frenzy over generative AI which can create full sentence responses to prompts or create lifelike images or sounds.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut generative AI software can invent answers, known as hallucinations, when it lacks sufficient training data. Mehta said Amelia could hallucinate and such occasions would be addressed depending on the severity of the mistake.\n\nHe said Amazon had no plans to offer ads within Amelia. The service will not be made available in its current form to large brands such as Unilever, who also sell on Amazon, he said.\n\nAmazon said Amelia will initially be available only to a small subset of sellers and only in English before nearly all U.S. sellers gain access over the next month.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically “tread water,” gaining less than “one half of one percent.”\n\n“Most of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don’t want to be giving up on the growth,” Stovall said.\n\nStovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\n\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors’ radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Trending AI Stock to Watch in September?\n\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\n“Despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,” Cantor said.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2023 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence management would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is launching an artificially intelligent assistant designed to help online merchants manage their businesses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority The Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America’s Roads California’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough New York City’s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways To Build a Happier City, Design for Density\n\nCodenamed Project Amelia, the new tool will answer a range of questions, from how to prepare for the holiday shopping season to suggesting the wording of product listings, Amazon said Thursday during its annual Accelerate conference for merchants.\n\nAmazon has been rolling out various AI tools amid intensifying competition with Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Open AI. One is a workplace chatbot called Amazon Q that helps corporate customers search for information, write code and review business metrics. Rufus lets consumers comparison shop and research products on Amazon’s web store.\n\nFor the merchants, who account for most of the sales on Amazon retail sites, the company has introduced software designed to help them optimize product listings and create or modify images. On Thursday, Amazon said it would also give them tools to create product videos.\n\nAmelia is available in beta for a subset of merchants and will be rolled out to all US sellers “over roughly the next month,” Dharmesh Mehta, an Amazon vice president who oversees seller services, said in an interview. Later this year, Amazon will start introducing Amelia to other countries and making it available in languages besides English.\n\nThe assistant is built atop Bedrock, a software platform designed to make it easier to access other companies’ large language models, as well as Amazon’s own. Mehta said Amelia had relied on a variety of different models through its development. He didn’t specify which ones power it today.\n\nMehta conceded that sellers weren’t clamoring for an AI chatbot specifically, but that Amazon thinks the tool can help simplify selling online. “The thing we hear from sellers regularly is, ‘Hey Amazon, I’ve got to do a lot of things, figure out a lot of stuff to be successful and I want to be an expert in these because it really drives my business,’” he said.\n\nIn a video presentation at the conference, Mehta demonstrated Amelia surfacing bullet points about a seller’s product line and offering recommendations. Over time, Amelia will provide a more personalized experience and become better at anticipating merchants’ needs, he said. It will also grow more capable of taking action on a seller’s behalf.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon long ago began automating elements of the relationship with millions of third-party sellers, some of whom say they’re at the mercy of algorithms that can suspend their accounts unfairly. In the video, Amazon demonstrated a seller asking a question about a product shipment that hadn’t shown up in Amazon’s records. If the software can’t find the answer, it can connect sellers with Amazon’s support teams.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool The Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success Trump’s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection How a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison Who Loses in Trump’s Endless Trade War?

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Goldman Sachs Is Bullish On This AI Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks.\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2024, held earlier this month, brought several significant updates on the technology sector for investors, particularly focusing on innovation and financial growth across growth industries. Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\n\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. The CEO of Amazon Web Services, Matt Garman, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, noting that AI was going to completely change almost every single industry in a fundamental way. Garman detailed that the early splashes of generative AI, like that of a cool chatbot, or cloud call call centers, were great but investors were missing the actual value proposition of the new technology. He said that generative AI would force companies into thinking about the core of their business, and industry-specific solutions would be unlocked through AI that were not possible before.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been investing in data centers, servers, network and global infrastructure to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to AI tech. Garman said in response to a question about the AI growth of the Amazon cloud business that investments in custom infrastructure, especially in networking and chip domains, over the past decade had helped the tech giant reduce costs associated with AI development, putting it on a path to sustainable growth.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Among the Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\n\nShould Investors Be Overly Cautious?\n\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\n\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\n\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\n“...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.”\n\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\n\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\n\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\n\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $1961.21 billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence, and is considered one of the Big Five American technology companies. It started by selling books online but now offers a massive selection of products across various categories. Beyond e-commerce, it owns AWS, a dominant cloud computing platform, and has a significant presence in digital streaming with Prime Video.\n\nAs of Q2 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is held by 308 hedge funds. From these, the highest stake is valued at $8,460,561,806 by Fisher Asset Management.\n\nThe company remains a leader in online retail and cloud computing. AWS is its most profitable segment, boasting over 30% margins, though it faces increasing competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. AWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making its performance a crucial factor in the company's future profits. AWS increased its revenue by 18.8% year-over-year in Q2 2024.\n\nAmazon Prime has also evolved into a major success led by 200 million global members and enhancing customer loyalty. The subscription service drives higher spending among members and is approaching an annual run rate of $100 billion, alongside significant growth in Advertising Services. However, physical stores, including Whole Foods Market, remain the smallest and slowest-growing revenue stream for the company.\n\nHayden Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we’ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today.\n\nSome of our biggest winners in the last two years, have been “re-acceleration” stories. These are cases where once rapidly growing companies suddenly put the brakes on during a weak economy. There could be several reasons for this – customers pulling back during a recession, the company proactively curtailing growth spend as a precaution, needing to cut costs & right-size the business to become profitable quickly, or many other reasons.\n\nBut the commonality seems to be that as soon as growth stops, the market narrative turns suddenly from positive, to “this company is finished”. They go from being valued for many years of rapid growth, to being priced like a mature company that will never realize significant growth again. But often neither scenario is true, with the ultimate future path somewhere in between.\n\nI find the fact this type of opportunity even exists, fascinating. Especially since it seems to happen every bear-market – perhaps indicating it’s embedded in human nature (and thus persistent & likely minable throughout one’s investing career). For example, I gave the examples of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock performance in our Q1 2022 letter (please re-read this piece for more context; LINK)…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon’s new RTO mandate is ‘a triumph of traditional management over innovative management,’ says former Google exec",
        "content": "Laszlo Bock, consultant and former Google senior executive, likened Andy Jassy’s demand that Amazon employees spend five days a week in the office to ordering the usual at a restaurant.\n\nSay the hamburger is your pick of choice at the regular joint and you all of a sudden go for the grilled chicken, Bock suggested. The chicken turns out to be okay, “no better than the hamburger, it’s no worse.” Naturally, you’ll revert back to the burger, or the norm.\n\n“You default back to what you’re comfortable with,” Bock told Fortune. The Gretel AI data platform cofounder is a corporate culture expert and was senior people exec at Google from 2006 to 2016, a period during which the tech giant was named Best Company to Work For dozens of times. “Why would you ever have the chicken sandwich again?” he asked.\n\nIt’s a classic tale of executives falling back into the familiar schedule of fully in-person work after five years of attempting or waffling on flexible, remote, or hybrid schedules. Joining the ranks this week was Amazon, as Jassy increased the mandated number of in-office days from three to five, in a note sent to employees on Monday. Amazon responded to requests for comment by referring Fortune to said memo.\n\nThe memo, posted on the company site, stressed the importance of in-person attendance as nourishment for company culture and collaboration. It also outlined changing the structure to reducer staff in management positions.\n\nBock called the move “a triumph of traditional management over innovative management,” explaining that the latter style is more difficult and needs more data to support its implementation.\n\nWhy do execs detest flexible work?\n\nHybrid work can be a successful boost to productivity if managed well, said Bock, pointing to early studies, work from companies like Atlassian that host community events, and the success of employers implementing focal days. During the early days of the pandemic, productivity increased after companies put effort into their plans. In turn, employees responded positively to it, added Bock, author of the New York Times bestseller Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead.\n\nYet to actually do hybrid work well requires resources, a clear plan, and above all, buy in. Most companies aren’t looking to put in the effort without guaranteed results, therefore dampening the potential benefit of mixed-mode work. In the absence of an effective flexible schedule, hybrid work’s cons became all the more clear— including a diffuse culture, feeling of disconnect, generic culture, and managers who don’t feel in control, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“From a company perspective there is not clear, overwhelming evidence that this is good,” Bock said And because it’s such a change, executives need an evidence windfall to alter course. “Employees love it” because it values their autonomy and freedom. But they lose out when employers, especially big ones like Amazon that struggle due to their size, pull out of hybrid plans.\n\nIn a sense companies fumbled the bag on hybrid work, giving up on a new strategy once it stopped being sexy enough. Or in other words, executives “created a self fulfilling prophecy that is now dragging people back to the office kicking and screaming.”\n\nWill Amazon actually lose talent?\n\nAmazon’s announcement wasn’t exactly met with open arms. Some employees expressed dismay and disapproval over the mandate, as one posted on Slack that it's a sign of “going backwards,” according to Business Insider.\n\nCompanies run the risk of losing out on top talent when they shirk flexibility, but Bock seems to think that Amazon isn’t running a terrible gamble here. “Very few people vote with their feet,” he said, adding that the strategy likely won’t hurt the company in the long run. Even though it’s controversial and many remote or hybrid Amazonians are likely peeved, many won’t leave, he noted. And successful companies will continue to have a large talent pool to draw from even if they are rolling out polarizing ultimatums, he said.\n\nAs for the new management strategy, Bock sees it as a way to pare micromanaging. It’s a “very clear call for productivity, but it's also a call for managers focusing on actually making things work better,” he said. He referenced Google’s rule of seven, which didn't hire managers for teams with fewer than seven employees as to disperse their time and tamp down over involvement that could border on control.\n\nEven so, with all this change, he “imagine[s] it's going to be a very stressful time for managers at Amazon.” Despite getting flamed online, this isn’t all that out of the ordinary for Amazon. It “reflects their values,” as a tight organizational culture which is intense and is rooted in close management, he said.\n\nCalling the memo \"entirely expected and actually quite thoughtful,\" Bock praised their data-driven approach and added that many companies will likely follow suit. And this approach perhaps is better in the long-term as humans crave social connection and tend to lose that during poorly executed hybrid plans, he added.\n\nRather than simply issuing an edict like a banking CEO who simply sees RTO as important, Amazon is tying its mandate to internal data and culture, he explained Bock. While some companies tried to wait for the (still impending) downturn to get their in-office way and others went for the incremental “boil the frog” route, neither turned out all that effective\n\nBut Amazon will likely get its way.  “They will force it...they’ll make it happen,” said Bock. He has “no doubt they’re going to measure it and monitor it” and that  “they're going to fire people for noncompliance.”\n\nAnd more edicts might be forthcoming. Amazon is a sort of bellwether for others, and “all of tech has kind of moved in this direction,” noted Bock. In other words, “most companies just don't put in the effort, and they just keep ordering the cheeseburger.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. As the company integrates AI features into the cloud, the software side of the business paints a compelling growth story. The web services section of the firm has an operating margin of more than 34%, far higher than the 5% operating margin of the ecommerce side of the business. The company aims to boost the AWS segment in the coming months with an extensive partner ecosystem and AI capabilities. On the ecommerce side, the firm is focused on growing the international segment.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) might be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a new US government order to increase tariffs on low priced goods entering the country from abroad. In the past few years, Chinese ecommerce giants have had a competitive advantage over Amazon due to the lower taxes and tariffs on low priced goods. Deutsche Bank recently said in an investor note that US President Biden intends to take executive action while waiting for Congress to pass a bill related to the de minimis provision on trade.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Amazon (AMZN) closed at $186.43, marking a -0.24% move from the previous day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.29%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.25%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.31%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the online retailer had gained 4.47% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 4.15% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.57% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Amazon in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.15, signifying a 35.29% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $157.05 billion, showing a 9.76% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.49 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +63.45% and +10.39%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.48% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, Amazon possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Amazon is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 39.39. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.78.\n\nOne should further note that AMZN currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.44. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.07.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, finds itself in the top 23% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The appraisal equals a total investment of over $2.2 billion.\n\nLast week, Amazon raised delivery driver pay to $22 per hour and invested $2 billion following regulatory scrutiny and unionization efforts. The e-commerce retailer had drawn intense regulatory scrutiny over worker safety and pay at its warehouses.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon’s U.S. sales reached $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday, marking a 9.6% annual growth and quashing the estimate of $12 billion. The total online sales for Cyber Week reached $38 billion, surpassing the $37.2 billion estimate.\n\nReports indicated Amazon hired 150,000 full-time, seasonal, and part-time workers for the holiday season in 2022 and 2021. It employed over 110,000 seasonal workers in India ahead of the festive season, the Times of India reports.\n\nEarlier this week, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) Sam’s Club shared plans to raise the pay for almost 100,000 frontline associates to over $19 per hour with the potential to earn thousands of dollars annually in bonuses based on years of service.\n\nThe retailers’ pay boosts reflect the workers’ importance in tapping the busy holiday season demand.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The company recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. The cloud departments of these tech giants are leading these investments.\n\nWells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Intel finally gives Wall Street good news",
        "content": "After a disastrous second quarter earnings report in August that resulted in the worst trading day for the company’s stock in 40 years, Intel (INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger finally has some good news for Wall Street.\n\nOn Monday, Gelsinger announced that Intel has entered into an agreement with Amazon Web Services that will see the chipmaker produce custom chips for the cloud computing giant.\n\nThe CEO also said that Intel will transform its Foundry business into a subsidiary company with independent directors. A foundry is a manufacturing facility for semiconductors. The move is meant to create clear separation between Intel’s design and manufacturing businesses, providing Intel’s foundry customers with the peace of mind that its design teams won’t have access to their chips.\n\nThat’s not all. Intel also confirmed that it was awarded $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act. In a release, the company said the deal will “help secure the domestic chip supply chain and collaborate with the [Department of Defense] to help enhance the resilience of US technological systems by advancing secure, cutting-edge solutions.”\n\nIt’s not all positive news for Intel, though. It’s in the midst of a massive restructuring plan, which includes laying off 15% of its workforce. The company also announced on Monday that it’s putting some of its plans to build new facilities in Europe on hold. And while it will complete its advanced packaging hub in Malaysia, Intel says it won’t start up the factory until demand improves.\n\nThen there’s Wall Street. While shares of rivals like Nvidia continue to climb, Intel’s stock has fallen a staggering 57% year to date.\n\n“I wouldn't say they're out of the woods yet,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance. “But I'd say additional funding sources, additional partner announcements, a cleaner structure for outside partners to invest are all the right motions.”\n\nIntel’s foundry business gets a boost\n\nIntel is a rarity among semiconductor giants in that it both designs and assembles its own chips. Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) each work with third-party manufacturers, namely TSMC, the world’s largest advanced chipmaker.\n\nIntel is looking to grab market share for TSMC, and to do that it's making chips for both itself and third-party customers. Before the Amazon (AMZN) news, Microsoft (MSFT) was Intel’s most prominent manufacturing customer. Adding another marquee name, however, helps to further establish Intel’s credibility as a chip builder that can assemble semiconductors based on customers’ needs.\n\nStory continues Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Intel is saying that it will have operating guidelines and independent board members that will be fully transparent,” Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights, told Yahoo Finance. “And I think if they get the right agreement, the right operating rules … I think they have something here. I really do.”\n\nIntel’s foundry moves will also provide the company with the chance to find outside capital for the business.\n\n“Foundry business will now potentially be better able to access outside sources of funding; providing the struggling business line with capital-raising capabilities and, ideally, allow [Intel] to continue focusing on manufacturing capabilities without offsetting core business performance, striking a balance between [long-term] growth prospects and [short-term] profitability concerns,” Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in an investor note following Intel’s announcements.\n\nBut Intel’s foundry business has reportedly faced setbacks. According to Reuters, Broadcom, which is evaluating Intel’s manufacturing processes, was disappointed with test runs of Intel-built chips. Getting Amazon onboard, however, appears to show that Intel’s manufacturing is working for certain customers.\n\nIntel’s work with the Department of Defense, meanwhile, illustrates that the government considers it a crucial supplier for some of its most critical components. Semiconductor assembly plants, Gelsinger has said, will play as large a role in geopolitics over the next 50 years as oil refineries played in the previous 50 years. And Intel is set up to play an important part in that for the US.\n\nNew chips will test Intel’s market strength\n\nIntel’s foundry business alone won’t determine its future prospects, though. Its AI and data center segment will also need to step up after the company made earlier mistakes in the space for high-powered chips.\n\nAccording to Moorhead, Intel’s Gaudi AI processor hasn’t caught on among hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because it came out after those companies began using or working on their own AI accelerators, giving them little reason to purchase Intel’s offerings. Excavators stand in the early morning on the construction site where chip manufacturer Intel wants to build a chip factory.(Klaus-Dietmar Gabbert/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nIntel does have a new GPU coming in 2025 that could prove to be competitive with Nvidia’s and AMD’s data center chips, but it will need to regain customers’ trust if it’s going to take any market share.\n\nThen there’s Intel’s Client Computing Group, which is responsible for the processors that power desktops and laptops around the world. The segment still generates the largest chunk of the company’s revenue, but is facing stiff competition from rival AMD and Qualcomm’s upstart PC chip business.\n\nTo combat that, the company debuted its Core Ultra 200V line of chips earlier this month. Intel says it packs the kind of performance and battery life customers have been clamoring for, and puts the chips up there with the likes of Apple’s custom processors that have won fans thanks to their own powerful and power-efficient design.\n\nNow Intel just has to make sure the Core Ultra 200V series lives up to expectations when it starts hitting store shelves in new laptops this fall. If it can do that, and continue to sign up customers for its foundry segment, Intel could soon find itself back on the upswing.\n\n“This is a good start,” said Newman. “I think anyone that tells you they've turned the corner … is probably ill-informed. But I would say, if you were looking for a kind of a roadmap or signal, the … Ruben Roydirection off the bottom is palpable.” Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Oracle's Larry Ellison Briefly Became Wealthier Than Jeff Bezos. Here's How His Fortune Outpaced Amazon's Founder\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Amazon's Jeff Bezos on the list of the world's richest people after Oracle's stock hit record highs. Ellison's net worth was just behind Tesla's Elon Musk on the billionaire leaderboard. Here’s how this happened.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nThe rise of AI has been a major driver of Oracle's growth this year. Oracle has positioned itself as a key player in the AI sector, partnering with companies like Nvidia to provide the infrastructure needed to support AI development.\n\nThis has significantly boosted Oracle's stock, which has gone up 64% in 2024, making it one of the top-performing tech stocks. At the time of writing, the stock was sitting at $170.33, up from $104.06 at the beginning of the year.\n\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nEllison, who holds roughly 40% of Oracle, has profited directly from the recent spike in stock prices. At one point, his wealth increased to over $208 billion, briefly surpassing Jeff Bezos’s $204 billion net worth. For the first time, Ellison was listed as the second-richest person in the world, marking a significant milestone.\n\nHowever, Ellison's net worth later dropped to $181 billion, while Bezos climbed to $208 billion. At the time of writing, Elon Musk remains the wealthiest person, with a net worth of $248 billion.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk’s secret mansion in Austin revealed through court filings. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before prices go back up.\n\nOracle's focus on cloud services and AI has been paying off, while Bezos's fortune, mostly tied to Amazon, hasn't grown as quickly in the same period. Still, Bezos remains a major player and the gap between their wealth has been small, with the two billionaires trading places on the rich list.\n\nIronically, Oracle's success has partly come from a new partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, they announced that Oracle's database software would now be available for AWS customers.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nEllison's confidence in Oracle's future is evident. At a recent event, he predicted that Oracle's cloud databases will continue to grow as more companies choose Oracle for their cloud services, sharing optimistic revenue forecasts through 2029, which has fueled investor excitement.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring a recent Oracle financial analyst meeting, Ellison expressed his belief that AI will usher in a new era of widespread monitoring. Oracle is prepared to serve as the backbone of this transformation. “Citizens will be on their best behavior because we’re constantly recording and reporting,” Ellison said, sparking some debate.\n\nWith Oracle's strong positioning in AI and cloud computing and its partnerships with AWS, Microsoft and Google, Ellison's wealth will likely continue growing. However, as seen with billionaires like Bezos, Musk and others, fortunes can fluctuate rapidly depending on market movements.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is raising the pay of its hourly warehouse workers by at least $1.50 an hour and adding Prime memberships to their benefits.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCalifornia’s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough Pipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate To Build a Happier City, Design for Density London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nThe raises will take effect this month for the hundreds of thousands of employees working for Amazon’s sprawling US logistics operation, boosting the average base wage to more than $22 an hour, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. The pay bump comes as inflation, though well below its post-pandemic highs, continues to eat away at the value of workers’ paychecks.\n\nEmployees will start receiving Prime, Amazon’s speedy shipping and video subscription service, as part of their compensation beginning early next year, the company said. The additional investment in pay and benefits, $2.2 billion, is the company’s largest, logistics chief Udit Madan said in the blog.\n\nThe Seattle-based company tends to announce pay tweaks and seasonal hiring goals ahead of the holiday shopping rush. Last year, Amazon said it would spend $1.3 billion boosting worker wages and benefits.\n\nAmazon’s pay rates tend to fall between those of physical retailers — the source of many Amazon recruits — and higher-skilled work in the logistics industry. Walmart Inc.-owned Sam’s Club this week said starting wages would increase by $1, to $16 an hour. Costco Wholesale Corp. raised its starting wage for US workers to $19.50 in July.\n\nAmazon is the second largest private-sector employer in the US, trailing only Walmart. In a survey of Amazon warehouse workers conducted by researchers last year, about half reported struggling to afford enough food or a place to live.

These new capabilities are part of Amazon’s focus on innovating to help businesses of all sizes increase their sales on their own online stores and other channels beyond Amazon.com.\n\nTransforming how Brands Grow Across their Sales Channels\n\nTo help merchants build and scale their businesses across their own websites, other marketplace service providers, and social media channels, Amazon offers a suite of externalized ecommerce services that leverage the power of Amazon’s fulfillment network and the Prime shopping experience. Amazon MCF is the foundational supply chain service operating in more than 10 countries. This service gives merchants the option to have Amazon pick, pack, and ship their orders for channels beyond Amazon.com. Buy with Prime, currently available in the U.S., uses the trust and recognition of the Prime brand to help increase traffic and sales on merchant DTC websites, while also leveraging Amazon MCF to fulfill and deliver orders. For Prime members, Buy with Prime is a member benefit that unlocks even greater selection, value, and convenience beyond Amazon.com. By using Amazon MCF and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), merchants can quickly scale up and scale down a single, shared pool of inventory based on customer demand across their sales channels. This has helped merchants cut out-of-stock rates by an average of 13% and improve inventory turnover by an average of 24%. Amazon’s continued innovation in Amazon MCF and Buy with Prime have made them invaluable tools for merchants looking to grow and scale their businesses across all their sales channels.\n\n\"Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment continue to help sellers attract new shoppers with the convenient, fast, and predictable experience they expect from Amazon,\" said Peter Larsen, vice president of Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment. \"Both services have seen significant growth over the last year, and we’re delighted to add to the momentum and partner with PayPal, Google, TikTok Ads, and Shopify to give brands even more options to grow their businesses.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMerchant Growth with Buy with Prime\n\nBuy with Prime launched in 2022 with a dozen brands and the goal of helping DTC merchants overcome challenges with acquiring new shoppers and driving conversion by offering quick and reliable delivery, and increasing their long-term relationships with customers. By leveraging the power of Amazon’s fulfillment network and the trust and recognition of the Prime brand, Buy with Prime continues to focus on helping businesses grow by making it easy for them to offer fast, free delivery; easy returns; 24/7 shopper support; and a convenient checkout experience.\n\nBuy with Prime momentum includes:\n\nSaw an increase so far this year of more than 45% in Buy with Prime orders year-over-year through merchant websites, with merchants generating an average 16% increase in revenue per shopper from offering Buy with Prime. Helped merchants bring new traffic to their site so far this year, with over 50% more Prime members shopping Buy with Prime year-over-year. Leveraged one of Amazon’s biggest shopping moments of the year to garner a 300% increase in the number of orders for Buy with Prime merchants during the Prime Day 2024 event. Increased the number of merchants offering Buy with Prime so far this year by over 25% year-over-year with hundreds of new brands to shop including IZOD, Elizabeth Arden, Dollar Shave Club, Shokz, Brumate, Buxom Cosmetics, Thunder Works, Toroe, Backbone, babysense, Tini Lux, Feliway, Iron Flask, Nectarlife, Waterdrop Filter, and more.\n\n\"No matter the history or longevity of your store, if someone sees Buy with Prime and the option to check out using their Amazon account, it gives them an elevated sense of trust,\" said David Parrish, founder and chief executive officer for SnS Grills, a Buy with Prime merchant. \"Our experience with Buy with Prime is simple: it works, and it works well. We think it’s a powerful solution for merchants, and those who adopt it will see the rewards—quickly.\"\n\nDriving Traffic Through New Advertising Solutions\n\nTo help merchants lower their cost to acquire new customers and drive traffic to their Buy with Prime enabled items, Buy with Prime is introducing two unique advertising solutions:\n\nIntroducingAmazon DSP for Buy with Prime – Buy with Prime merchants can now launch Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP) campaigns that leverage Amazon product-level shopping signals to drive traffic to their ecommerce websites. By combining insights from their Amazon.com listings—like product views and purchases—with shopping signals from their own website, merchants can remarket to these shoppers with ads across thousands of third-party apps and websites. More than 80% of merchants who’ve used Amazon DSP for Buy with Prime have reported meeting or exceeding their return on ad spend (ROAS) goals. Integrating Delivery Estimates in TikTok Ads – Buy with Prime merchants will be able to display the Prime brand and real-time delivery estimates in their TikTok Ads next month. After clicking the Shop with Prime button within the merchant’s ad, shoppers will be directed to the merchant’s website to place their order. Featuring the familiar Prime delivery estimate will help merchants stand out, drive traffic from social channels, and increase conversion.\n\n\"Within two weeks of using Amazon DSP for Buy with Prime to remarket to engaged shoppers across the web, it’s already our second-highest performing ad channel giving us an incredibly strong return on advertising spend,\" said Tommy Kowalski, vice president of digital commerce for HEYDUDE, a Buy with Prime merchant.\n\nDelighting Buy with Prime Shoppers with New Ways to Pay and Check out\n\nContinuing the Buy with Prime journey to extend Prime shopping benefits beyond Amazon.com, the company is rolling out enhancements to the Buy with Prime shopping experience, including:\n\nExpanded Payment Options with PayPal – For participating brands integrating using the Buy with Prime API, PayPal is now available at checkout after shoppers log in to their Amazon account. And starting next year, Prime members will be able to perform a one-time link of their Amazon account to their PayPal account so that Prime free, fast shipping benefits are available automatically whenever they use PayPal while shopping with Buy with Prime on participating merchants’ websites. Purchase items with Prime and without Prime in one Checkout via Shopify Stores – Using the existing Shopify cart and checkout, shoppers can now purchase items with Prime and without Prime, together in one order. This capability extends the functionality of the Buy with Prime app for Shopify that launched in the Shopify App Store last year to help merchants increase their units per order and average order value.\n\nDriving Sales Growth with Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment\n\nWith Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment, merchants can leverage Amazon’s fulfillment network to pick, pack, ship, and deliver their orders from channels beyond Amazon.com, including their own website, other ecommerce marketplaces, and social media channels. This solution works with over 100 prebuilt integrations or merchants can build a custom integration tailored to their needs.\n\nAmazon MCF has grown to serve over 200,000 U.S. merchants and seen a 70% year-over-year increase in total orders fulfilled by the service so far this year. To further improve the delivery experience and drive traffic to merchants’ websites, Amazon MCF is introducing:\n\nSpeeding Up the Amazon MCF Standard Delivery Option by 40% – As Amazon continues to invest in speed throughout its fulfillment network, Amazon MCF is now reducing its Standard Delivery option from 5 business days to 3 business days at no extra cost to merchants. Customers can now enjoy this faster delivery speed along with deliveries made 7 days a week. MCF Fast Badges for Merchant Websites – Like with Buy with Prime, merchants can now show a dynamic, real-time delivery estimate on their website. MCF fast badges give shoppers visibility into when they'll receive the product early in their shopping journey, and helps merchants increase shopper conversion. For example, sports apparel company NXTRND saw an 8.9% increase in revenue using an Amazon MCF delivery estimate. Delivery Estimates in Google Shopping and TikTok Ads – This month, merchants will also be able to show an estimated delivery date in their Google Shopping ads and search results, and in their TikTok ads. Displaying a fast, reliable delivery speed on ads can help merchants drive more shoppers to their site while boosting their ROAS.\n\n\"With Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment, our ability to scale was essentially unlimited. We didn’t have to buy warehouses, trucks, planes, or other logistics resources like packaging or labels—we could rely on Amazon to provide that,\" said Craig Barnell, co-founder and chief operating officer, Fishers Finery, an Amazon MCF merchant. \"Amazon has helped us to exceed customers’ expectations. In fact, we regularly get emails from customers saying, ‘I can’t believe how fast and on-time our package got to us!’\"\n\nMerchants interested in learning more can visit the Buy with Prime website or Amazon MCF website.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240918507437/en/\n\nContacts\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.\r\nMedia Hotline\r\nAmazon-pr@amazon.com \r\nwww.amazon.com/pr\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 blue chip stocks. The index has returned 10% year to date, but companies making big splashes in artificial intelligence (AI) could fare much better over the next year and beyond.\n\nHere are two Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has delivered wealth-building returns for shareholders over the last few decades, and it's currently up 22% in 2024. Amazon still has plenty of growth opportunities in retail and enterprise cloud services to fuel the stock higher.\n\nAmazon's expanding same-day delivery and growing selection of items will be important advantages in capturing a growing share of the global e-commerce market. Data and intelligence platform Statista predicts that online retail spending will surpass $8 trillion by 2027.\n\nWhat makes the stock particularly attractive right now is the company's improving profit margin. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter over the year-ago quarter, and there are still several opportunities to improve retail margins further, including decreasing transportation costs by getting closer to customers with more same-day delivery facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's cloud service business, which generates two-thirds of the company's operating income, is showing even greater growth potential. Companies are migrating their data from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services to take advantage of tools like Amazon Bedrock, which helps companies build their own AI applications. Amazon also offers custom AI chips that offer better price performance than higher-priced chips from top hardware supplier Nvidia. These are a few of the reasons why AWS' revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to 19% over the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe opportunities in online commerce and cloud services are great reasons to consider buying Amazon shares in 2024. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at double-digit rates in the coming years, and that points to more new highs for the stock.\n\n2. Apple\n\nA significant driver of economic growth will be the AI market. AI software will simplify tasks and help people find what they need a lot faster, which could lead to significant increases in productivity. There's no consumer brand that is better positioned to benefit from this trend than Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe iPhone is an essential device that people check as soon as they wake up in the morning. With over 2.2 billion active devices, Apple will be the face of AI for millions, which is why the stock is up this year heading into the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Intelligence will begin rolling out to U.S. users as a free update in the next month. The opportunity for Apple is that Apple Intelligence requires devices with the more recent M1 and later-generation processors. This provides a natural incentive for users to upgrade to the new iPhone 16.\n\nCitigroup's internal research shows that customers pre-ordering the new iPhones are opting to go for the premium Pro Max model. This bodes well for Apple's margins, which have already been moving higher in recent years from growth in paid subscriptions and other offerings as part of its services segment.\n\nIDC expects smartphone shipments with generative AI features to grow 364% in 2024 to 234 million. By 2028, that figure is expected to reach 912 million. Apple Intelligence will help the company further distinguish its brand, which could lead to market share gains, growth in its installed base of devices, and more demand for high-margin services.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple's earnings to increase by 17% in fiscal 2024 (ending in September) and 11% next year. Apple should be able to sustain double-digit earnings growth for several more years and deliver superior returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Trillion-Dollar Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Investors are rarely at a loss for important data releases on Wall Street. Monthly economic reports highlighting jobs data and the prevailing rate of inflation, coupled with roughly six weeks crammed full of earnings reports from thousands of publicly traded companies, have the potential to overwhelm investors and allow key announcements to slide under the radar.\n\nIn mid-August, one of these important announcements may have gone unnoticed.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a concise, under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). In other words, 13Fs clue investors into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have been piquing the interest of Wall Street's top asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe second quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire money managers. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves on Wall Street, billionaire investors were clear sellers of AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and big-time buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nBillionaire money managers gave Nvidia the boot for a third consecutive quarter\n\nSelling shares of Nvidia is nothing new for Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. The latest quarter marked the third straight quarter that more than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors had reduced their stakes in Wall Street's leading AI stock. The seven billionaire sellers in the second quarter include (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nWith shares of Nvidia skyrocketing 715% since the start of 2023, as of he closing bell on Sept. 13, 2024, profit-taking is certainly a viable reason for billionaires to be reducing their stakes in the AI kingpin. But there may be much more to this precipitous selling activity than just simple profit-taking.\n\nFor instance, history has been brutally unkind to next-big-thing innovations and technologies over the last three decades. Although large addressable markets tend to excite investors, no game-changing innovation has escaped an early stage bubble in 30 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have a tendency to overestimate the adoption and/or utility of next-big-thing technologies and innovations, which eventually leads to real-world growth forecasts failing to meet otherworldly expectations. The simple fact that most businesses lack a genuine game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investments is a pretty clear warning that an artificial intelligence bubble is likely brewing.\n\nExternal and internal competition are going to be challenging for Nvidia, as well. In addition to rival chipmakers bringing AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) to market, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own. This should result in Nvidia's hardware losing out on valuable data center \"real estate\" in the future.\n\nLast but not least, the company's insiders have been big-time sellers. The last time a member of management or the board purchased shares of their company on the open market was December 2020.\n\nBut while billionaire investors were casting aside shares of Nvidia during the second quarter, they were busy buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first trillion-dollar company and \"Magnificent Seven\" member that billionaires fancied instead of Nvidia in the June-ended quarter is e-commerce goliath Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The five billionaire asset managers who bought shares of Amazon include (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,391,262 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,597,676 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,214,055 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,114,948 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (702,235 shares)\n\nThough Amazon's consumer-facing online marketplace is how most people become familiar with the company, online retail sales account for very little of Amazon's operating cash flow and net income. At the moment, the lion's share of its operating income can be traced to its globally leading cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nSales growth for AWS reaccelerated in the second quarter to 19% from the prior-year period, but has consistently remained in the double digits. With businesses still very early in their cloud-spending cycle, and AWS controlling an estimated 33% of the global cloud infrastructure service market, per Canalys, this operating segment should remain Amazon's cash cow moving forward.\n\nAmazon is also generating plenty of cash flow and double-digit sales growth from its two other ancillary operating segments: advertising services and subscription services. The former is benefiting from the exceptional ad-pricing power that comes with attracting north of 3 billion visits each month.\n\nMeanwhile, subscription services (e.g., Prime) should thrive on the heels of an expansive content library. Amazon has become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football and recently signed an 11-year streaming rights deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA). When coupled with the value Prime provides to its online marketplace consumers (e.g., free two-day shipping on most items), it's readily apparent that Amazon possess meaningful pricing power with Prime.\n\nBased on traditional fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Amazon is far from cheap. But relative to consensus cash flow estimates for 2025 -- cash flow is a better measure of value for Amazon since it aggressively reinvests back into its business -- Amazon is valued well below the cash flow multiples it traded at throughout the 2010s.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe other trillion-dollar stock that Form 13Fs show billionaire investors have been favoring over Nvidia is software colossus Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). A total of eight billionaire fund managers purchased shares of Microsoft in the second quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,340,392 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (695,444 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (510,822 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (240,624 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (177,726 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (90,287 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (20,684 shares)\n\nThe primary buzz around Wall Street's second-largest publicly traded company by market cap is its artificial intelligence ties. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has worked with OpenAI to incorporate AI solutions into its Bing search engine and Edge web browser.\n\nAdditionally, Azure is the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. Microsoft is actively incorporating generative AI solutions and large language model capabilities into Azure to accelerate growth and make its platform more useful to enterprise clients. AI is very much at the heart of Microsoft's long-tail growth strategy.\n\nBut as I alluded earlier, there are signs that an early innings AI bubble is brewing. The good news for Microsoft is that it has its legacy segments to lean on.\n\nWhile Windows and Office are no longer the growth stories they were 20 years ago, Windows remains the dominant operating system on computers worldwide. In other words, Microsoft can count on predictable operating cash flow from these legacy segments in pretty much any economic climate.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft is sitting on a mountain of cash. Even after purchasing gaming company Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion last year, it closed out June with $75.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. In fact, Microsoft has generated more than $118 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. This cash affords Microsoft the ability to make acquisitions in order to rapidly expand its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Sai Ishwarbharath B and VarunVyas Hebbalalu\n\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com named Samir Kumar as its new India head on Wednesday, handing the reins to a 25-year company veteran as the e-commerce giant faces intense competition and regulatory pressures in the country.\n\nKumar was part of a team that launched Amazon India in 2013 and will take over from Manish Tiwary on Oct. 1, in addition to his current role as head of Amazon's consumer businesses in the Middle East, South Africa and Turkey.\n\nTiwary resigned last month, after an eight-year stint, to pursue an opportunity outside the company, Amazon had said, without elaborating further.\n\nThe change in leadership comes as the U.S. e-commerce giant is fast expanding in India, with plans to invest up to $26 billion by 2030, even as it faces intense regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLast week, Reuters reported India's antitrust body found that Amazon and its biggest local rival Flipkart violated laws by preferring select sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products, hurting other companies.\n\nA lawmaker of India's ruling party and a key retailers' group had also urged the country's government to suspend the operations of Amazon and Flipkart in light of the antitrust breaches.\n\n\"There have been some rumbles from the ruling politicians around how Amazon is impacting small traders and even consumers, and mistreating its warehouse workers. Samir will have to deal with the regulatory fallout,\" said Jaspreet Bindra, founder of tech advisory firm Tech Whisperer.\n\n(Reporting by Indranil Sarkar, Sai Ishwarbharath B and Varun Hebbalalu in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Varun H K)",

        "title": "Intel and Amazon Expand Partnership: Time to Buy These Iconic Tech Stocks?",
        "content": "As markets rise in anticipation of the Fed cutting rates tomorrow, Intel INTC and Amazon AMZN have helped lead the broader rally among tech stocks after announcing plans to expand their partnership on Monday.\n\nIntel’s stock had popped +8% in today’s trading session after recently falling to a 10-year low of $18 a share in August.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon shares were up as much as +2% in early morning trading and are now sitting on gains of over +20% for the year with AMZN edging toward $200. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPartnership Overview: Enhancing AWS Cloud Services\n\nWith Intel having a long-standing partnership to support Amazon’s cloud segment Amazon Web Services (AWS), the iconic tech companies have a new agreement to develop custom AI chips.\n\nThe chips will be developed using Intel’s 18A process which is designed to enhance performance and energy efficiency in a bid to boost the AI-as-a-service (AIaas) offerings of AWS.\n\nPerfect Timing for Intel\n\nLosing ground to many of its semiconductor peers, Intel stated its partnership to provide AI-powered chips for Amazon will be a multiyear, multibillion-dollar deal. The timing couldn’t be better as it gives Intel another opportunity to regain its footing as a major chip manufacturer after drastically losing market share to Nvidia NVDA and AMD AMD.\n\nThis may also quiet fears of Intel being able to preserve enough cash and gateways to growth to support the costly operations of its foundry business as a chip producer for other companies. These concerns have largely loomed despite Intel having $29.27 billion in cash & equivalents at the end of Q2 2024 and $206.2 billion in total assets compared to $85.77 billion in total liabilities.\n\nHowever, Intel’s sales and operating performance have steeply contracted in recent years although a modest rebound is expected in fiscal 2025. Notably, to capitalize on the collaboration with Amazon, Intel will be splitting its foundry business into an independent subsidiary to improve the segment’s efficiency. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon’s Upper Echelon Growth & Balance Sheet\n\nLuckily for Intel, it has continued a lucrative partnership with a cash cow in Amazon, with the e-commerce leader and tech conglomerate having over $89 billion in cash & equivalents. Furthermore, Amazon has $554.18 billion in total assets versus $318.37 billion in total liabilities. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Magnificent Seven-themed tech stock is expected to see high double-digit EPS growth in FY24 and FY25 with total sales projected to increase by over 10% in these fiscal years respectively. Notably, Amazon’s top line is edging toward a whopping $700 billion.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAmazon and Intel’s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The continued partnership between these tech giants should be lucrative for both companies and certainly adds to their prospects of being viable long-term investments.\n\nHowever, there could be better buying opportunities in Amazon’s stock after a sharp YTD rally while it may be too soon to say Intel shares are at an inflection point in regards to a continued rebound.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%​. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): A Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News\n\nPhoto by Sunrise King on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The company recently announced that it would invest £8 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around £2.5 billion to expand AI growth. The cloud departments of these tech giants are leading these investments.\n\nWells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines jets are parked at Kahului Airport on the island of Maui on March 29, 2018. Alaska Airlines will continue to operate the Hawaiian brand after taking ownership of the company. (Photo: Shutterstock/EQRoy)\n\nAlaska Airlines expects to finalize its $1.9 billion merger with Hawaiian Airlines on Wednesday after the Department of Transportation cleared the transaction, the company said in a regulatory filing Tuesday.\n\nDOT approval was the remaining hurdle for the merger. The Department of Justice last month quietly approved the transaction.\n\nThe combination of Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) and Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA) is important from a freight perspective because Alaska will take over cargo transportation for e-commerce giant Amazon. Hawaiian Airlines is operating a handful of Airbus A330 converted freighters for Amazon’s air logistics network and expects to have 10 cargo jets by next year.\n\nThe companies have never indicated whether the Amazon transportation services agreement with Hawaiian will need to be modified. Hawaiian began operating its first freighter last October. Amazon has warrants to take a 15% equity stake in Hawaiian Airlines after nine years conditioned on meeting a spending threshold of $1.8 billion.\n\nAlaska Airlines has long operated a small fleet of freighter aircraft, primarily between Alaska and Seattle. It currently has five converted freighters: three Boeing 737-700s and two 737-800s. Officials have previously said they anticipate savings from integrating the cargo operations from belly transport in passenger aircraft.\n\nAlaska is the fifth-biggest airline in the U.S. and Hawaiian is No. 10. The combination will solidify Alaska’s position as a stronger No. 5, which is important for the carrier to remain competitive with major U.S. carriers American, Delta, United and Southwest.\n\nThe carriers will continue to operate as separate brands, and Alaska has committed to keep serving Hawaii. The deal will give Alaska the opportunity to take some of Hawaiian’s long-range Boeing 787s and Airbus A330s and run them out of Seattle to Asia and Europe, but the real impetus for the merger was beating back Southwest Airlines. Both airlines serve Hawaii but lost market share when Southwest began serving the state in 2019.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.\n\nWrite to Eric Kulisch at ekulisch@freightwaves.com.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nHawaiian Airlines welcomes new Amazon revenue stream\n\nThe post DOT approves $1.9B Alaska Air, Hawaiian merger appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon's Leaner Structure and AI Chip Partnership with Intel Could Boost Growth: BofA Analyst\n\nBofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $210.\n\nThe re-rating reflects CEO Andy Jassy’s goal for a leaner Amazon by the end of the first quarter of 2025, translating into an estimated $700 million in cost savings and Amazon Web Services’ multi-year, multi-billion-dollar co-investment into custom AI chips with Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nPost noted that Intel chips would be more cost-effective for customers than alternatives. Intel will produce custom AI fabric chips for AWS that will be built on Intel 18A, the company’s most advanced process node.\n\nAccording to the analyst, AWS remains well-positioned to capture broad-based AI customer demand due to its more diverse and growing product offering.\n\nPost estimates $700 million annually in cost savings under Jassy’s plans to increase Amazon’s individual contributor-to-manager ratio by slashing management layers and making employees return to the office five days a week beginning in January.\n\nAssuming a non-warehouse workforce of 400,000 and a current manager-to-contributor ratio of 1 to 6, at least 2.5% of employees (around 7,000) are projected to shift from manager roles to contributor positions, and if the difference in pay is $100,000.\n\nPost’s price target is based on his sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis, which values the 1P retail business at 1.2 times 2025E Revenue, the 3P retail business at 3.0 times 2025E Revenue, AWS at 8.0 times 2025 Sales, and the advertising business at 5.0 times 2025 Sales.\n\nFor 2025E, Post’s 8.0 times AWS multiple is relatively below his SaaS comps at 8.5 times, his 1.2 times GMV multiple is a discount to his retail comps at 1.3 times, and his 5.0 times advertising multiple is a discount to his digital advertising comps at 5.2 times.\n\nThe analyst deems some conglomerate discounts as warranted with elevated regulatory risk but long-term notes that in-line to discount multiples are warranted given growth rates more than peers.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up 1.22% at $187.15 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for AMZN\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage On Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Intel Gains After Landing Amazon Deal, Preparing Factory Split",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. has made a raft of announcements over the past 24 hours in an effort to prove that a turnaround for the troubled chipmaker is starting to bear fruit.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPipeline Fire Near Houston Forces Some Residents to Evacuate London Mayor Plans to Pedestrianize Busy Oxford Street An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life\n\nChief among them: It struck a multibillion-dollar deal with Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services cloud unit to co-invest in a custom AI semiconductor. It’s shelving new factories in Germany and Poland. It may receive as much as $3 billion in US government funding to make chips for the military. And it’s turning its ailing manufacturing business, or foundry, into a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nThe news follows a meeting of Intel’s board last week, during which executives presented ways to conserve cash while keeping Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s longer-term turnaround plan on track. The CEO’s effort hinges on transforming Intel into a foundry, but the Santa Clara, California-based company has been slow to line up customers. A high-profile client such as Amazon represents a notable win.\n\nIntel shares rose as much as 4.8% after trading opened on Tuesday. They had been down 58% this year, closing at $20.91 on Monday.\n\nGelsinger, who embarked on a bold comeback effort for Intel in 2021, has had to scale back some of his ambitions in the name of efficiency. With sales shrinking and losses piling up, the company announced plans last month to slash 15,000 workers, find $10 billion in cost savings and suspend Intel’s dividend. Now he’s going further to rein in expansion plans, especially overseas.\n\nThe Poland and Germany construction projects will be paused for about two years depending on market demand. Another one in Malaysia will be completed but only put into operation when conditions support it, Intel said.\n\nThe postponement of the German factory marks a setback for the European Union’s semiconductor ambitions and is likely to reignite controversy in Berlin over where to allocate €10 billion ($11 billion) in earmarked subsidies.\n\nAlthough Intel is freezing work on new factories in Germany and Poland, it said it remains committed to its US expansion in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio.\n\nThe move to separate Intel’s foundry operations from the rest of the company is aimed in part at convincing prospective customers — some of whom compete with Intel — that they are dealing with an independent supplier. Bloomberg had previously reported that the company was weighing this option.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We still have things to learn about becoming a foundry,” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I need lots of customers.”\n\nIntel is also looking to speed up efforts to execute the $10 billion in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing, an area where rival Nvidia Corp. has excelled. And it hopes to pare its real estate globally by about two-thirds by the end of the year.\n\nAdditionally, the company reiterated plans to sell part of its stake in semiconductor maker Altera Corp. to private equity investors. The business, which Intel bought in 2015, was separated from its operations last year with the goal of taking it public.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the largest provider of cloud computing, and it could help build confidence that Intel can compete with the likes of foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. AWS has used Intel processors over the years, but has been shifting more toward in-house designs — the very products that Intel may now help manufacture.\n\nThe two companies will coinvest in a custom semiconductor for artificial intelligence computing – what’s known as a fabric chip – in a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar framework,” according to a statement Monday. The work will rely on Intel’s 18A process, an advanced chipmaking technology.\n\n“Today’s announcement is big,” Gelsinger said Monday of the deal. “This is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities.”\n\nMicrosoft Corp., another major cloud-computing provider, announced plans in February to use Intel for some of its in-house chips as well.\n\nIn another win, Intel said earlier Monday that it’s eligible to receive as much as $3 billion in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military. The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes. That news helped send the shares up 6.4% in regular trading Monday.\n\nThe Secure Enclave award is separate from a possible $8.5 billion Chips and Science Act grant that Intel is set to receive to support factories across four US states. The projects include a facility in New Albany, Ohio, that Intel has said could become the world’s largest chipmaking operation.\n\nIntel still has a long way to go to win back Wall Street’s full confidence. After years of losing ground to rivals and seeing its technological edge slip, the Silicon Valley pioneer is valued at less than $90 billion. It no longer ranks as one of the top 10 chip companies on that basis. Nvidia, meanwhile, now has a market capitalization of about $2.9 trillion.\n\nIntel shocked investors with a bleak financial report last month, triggering the biggest single-day stock decline in decades. Analysts described the announcement as Intel’s worst-ever earnings report.\n\nGelsinger, in a letter to employees, acknowledged that the chipmaker’s performance has drawn negative scrutiny — and spurred speculation over what might happen to the company. The only way to “quiet our critics” will be to deliver results and execute better, he said. This week’s announcements are a step toward that, he said.\n\n“Is it good enough? No. Is it substantial? Yes,” he said in the interview. “I’ve reupped my commitment. We’re going to finish a seminal assignment.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool How an Unknown Chinese Phonemaker Took Over Africa To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Business Schools Are Undergoing Unusual Change Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Oracle Shares Soar: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Tech stocks have delivered remarkable returns in 2024, with investors regularly clamoring for exposure. One of those stocks in particular, Oracle ORCL, recently delivered quarterly results that caused shares to melt higher post-earnings.\n\nThe company offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud. Up more than 60% in 2024, the company’s quarterly results have regularly brought post-earnings fireworks, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the release and how the company currently stacks up.\n\nOracle Reports Record Backlog\n\nConcerning headline figures, Oracle exceeded both consensus earnings and revenue expectations, with EPS growing 24% year-over-year alongside a 7% sales increase.\n\nThe company’s Cloud segment paved the way for a robust release, with Cloud services revenue climbing 21% and now reflecting the company’s largest business overall. Thanks to the robust performance within its Cloud segment, the company saw a growth acceleration in both operating income and EPS.\n\nAs shown below, the company’s top line stayed rather stagnant for some time before seeing an acceleration over recent years.

AWS remains the cloud infrastructure market leader, with customers expected to receive access to the Oracle database when it goes live later in December.\n\nIt’s worth noting here that Amazon isn’t the only Hyperscaler (large cloud service provider) that Oracle is in business with, as it’s already inked MultiCloud agreements with both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as well. All these deals bode highly favorable for the company, with customers able to utilize its database technology within every Hyperscaler’s Cloud.\n\nAre Shares Expensive?\n\nThe valuation picture for the stock is currently rich, with the current 25.3X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting near the high end of the five-year range. The steeper multiple is reflective of investors’ growth expectations, with the current 2.3X PEG ratio also near the high end of the five-year range. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShareholders Get Paid\n\nThe company also boasts a shareholder-friendly nature, currently carrying a sizable 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 34% of its earnings. Please note the final value in the chart below is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nOracle ORCL recently impressed the market with its quarterly results, with shares melting higher following the print. The company reported several notable highlights, announcing a massive deal with Amazon’s AMZN AWS that’s expected to bring positive tailwinds.\n\nThe valuation picture is a bit rich, but that’s reflective of investors’ big growth expectations following robust quarterly results in 2024. Shares are now trading near all-time highs thanks to the robust results, with more upside likely given its favorable position and record-breaking backlog.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nAMZN boasts a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Amazon are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 39X, as well as a PEG Ratio of 1.4, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 24.5X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 3.2X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. 13 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $4.74 per share.

The chipmaker will also fast-track efforts to implement the $10 billion in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing.\n\nIntel stock plunged 45% in the last 12 months as its foundry unit failed to capitalize on the AI shift, similar to contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Intel through Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:WISE) and Pacer Funds Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:TRFK).\n\nPrice Actions: INTC stock is up 6.55% at $22.28 premarket at last check Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia’s AI Surge Powers 25% of S&P 500 Gains in 2024, Makes Co-founder Huang Among Fastest Growing: Report\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Intel shares jumped 7% before the bell on Tuesday, as a chip-making deal with Amazon's cloud business provided a major stamp of approval for its struggling contract manufacturing business.\n\nThe chipmaker will build custom AI chips for Amazon Web Services (AWS) as part of the multibillion-dollar deal. The move expands a years-long tie-up between the companies under which Intel designs several chips used in Amazon's datacenters.\n\n\"The deal provides Intel with some credibility as it looks to gain traction with new external customers. In addition, it will help Intel sell itself as a supplier of custom AI silicon chips\" said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.\n\nIntel's stock has plunged nearly 60% this year and has lagged chip firms, including Nvidia and TSMC, as it missed out on an AI-driven boom in chip demand.\n\nThe company has been trying to regain the manufacturing edge it lost to TSMC by building out its foundry unit, which has been the centerpiece of CEO Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nAWS is among the first major customers Intel has announced a definitive deal with. It had said in February Microsoft would use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip.\n\nBut \"meaningful\" revenue from the capital-intensive foundry unit is not expected until 2027, even as expensive investments sap cash flow and draw investor ire.\n\nTo ease the pressure, Intel said it would pause chip factory projects in Poland and Germany by about two years, raising doubts about the nearly 10 billion euros ($11.14 billion) in subsidies from Germany for its two plants in the country.\n\n\"The move ... should help to boost cash flow, even if the focus on US-based fabs is unlikely to go down well in the EU. It will no doubt gain plaudits in Washington though and help Intel preserve important relationships,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.\n\n($1 = 0.8978 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "I won't keep you in suspense. The five biggest public companies in the world on Jan. 1, 1999, ranked in order from largest to smallest, were:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): $348 billion market cap General Electric(NYSE: GE): $261 billion market cap Intel(NASDAQ: INTC): $197 billion market cap Walmart(NYSE: WMT): $181 billion market cap ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM): $178 billion market cap\n\nHaving said that, there are a few important things to mention. For one thing, 1999 was the height of the dot-com bubble, and there was quite a bit of movement on the list throughout the year. For example, by the end of 1999, Microsoft had reached a market cap of more than $600 billion. Plus, Cisco Systems(NASDAQ: CSCO) had catapulted its way into the No. 3 spot, while Intel had fallen off it entirely.\n\nThe 5 biggest companies now\n\nAs you might expect given that 25 years have passed since 1999, the list of the largest public companies in the world has changed considerably. Here's where it stands as of Sep. 7, 2024:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.39 trillion Microsoft: $3.00 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): $2.53 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $1.88 trillion Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.78 trillion\n\nMicrosoft is the only company that appears on both lists, and the scale of the players on it has increased by about tenfold. Notably, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total U.S. inflation over that period was only around 92%, so most of that change reflects real growth, not a decline in the value of the dollar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon employees are slamming the company’s return-to-office policy and plotting their exit less than 24 hours after CEO Andy Jassy announced that they must return to the office five days a week from January.\n\nWhile some Amazon workers are ripping into the company’s toughened RTO policy on social media, others are even blasting their employer in the company’s internal Slack channel.\n\n\"Please do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-COVID,” one staffer wrote on Slack, according to Business Insider.\n\n“This is not 'going back' to how it was before. It's just going backwards.\"\n\nAnother employee suggested they’d rather be put on the company’s aggressive performance improvement plan than comply with the mandate: \"Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me… Take my money and leave?\"\n\nEmployees aren’t just talking about quitting, a small few have already changed their status on LinkedIn to #opentowork as they openly search for more flexible jobs.\n\n“Amazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on the networking platform.\n\n“If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.”\n\nA commentator on Reddit who claims to have worked at Amazon for three years said that they’re mentally checking out of their current role while they hunt for another.\n\n“Probably going to soft quit and get a new job. F—k Jassy,” the user wrote, describing the measure as a “swift kick to the nuts.”\n\nAmazon’s latest RTO mandate\n\nAmazon veteran, Jassy—who took the helm after Jeff Bezos stepped down in 2021—issued a memo to all staffers yesterday that said they will be required to work in the office “the way we were before the onset of COVID.”\n\n“Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward—our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,” Jassy, who started working at the $1.94 trillion tech giant in 1997, wrote.\n\nOf course, many people moved to the suburbs and made childcare arrangements according to the company’s current 3 day in-office policy—or as Jassy puts it “set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments.”\n\nThat’s why the 56-year-old said that the new stricter enforcement will not kick in until the new year to “help ensure a smooth transition.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CEO added that moving forward remote working will be reserved for emergency scenarios like “if you or your child” is sick.\n\n'What better way to cut jobs’\n\nJassy positioned the changes at Amazon—which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking—as a better way to work.\n\n\"We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another,\" Jassy insisted.\n\nHowever, some disgruntled proffesionals have suggested that the new policy is designed to reduce its current 1.5 million-plus headcount.\n\n“This is a layoff in disguise,” one user complained on Reddit. “Return to the office or you’re fired and we don’t have to pay any severance or unemployment.”\n\n“What better way to cut jobs than to force everyone back into the office and watch people quit in droves,” another wrote.\n\nAmazon didn’t respond to Fortune’s request for comment, including whether the policy is a thinly veiled headcount reduction.\n\nHowever, the company has previously used its in-office mandate to cut out defiant workers.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon managers were given the green light to fire employees who fail to show face three days a week in the office.\n\nMeanwhile the company’s \"return-to-hub\" mandate in July forced remote workers to pick working (and in some cases relocating) to the closest office to them—or resign.\n\nAre you an Amazon employee who’s planning to quit because of the new RTO policy?

        "content": "Amazon has told all its staff to return to the office five days a week next year, “the way we were before the onset of Covid”, the boss has said.\n\nIn a memo to employees, chief executive Andy Jassy said the company expected people to be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances from January 2.\n\nAmazon made it mandatory in 2023 for corporate staff to be in the office three days a week, a significant change after the Covid pandemic engendered a shift towards remote and hybrid working.\n\nMr Jassy said this had “strengthened our conviction about the benefits” of being in the office full-time.\n\nThat policy led to some backlash last year among workers at Amazon, with more than 20,000 people signing a petition urging the firm to reconsider the return-to-office mandate.\n\nWorkers at its Seattle headquarters in the US staged a walkout which also followed widespread cost-cutting at the firm, with layoffs affecting thousands of jobs since late 2023.\n\nMr Jassy stressed in his memo that the change would not force people to be in the office if they had extenuating circumstances, or if they had an agreement to work remotely with their manager. Amazon’s corporate staff currently have to be in the office three days a week (Amazon/PA)\n\n“Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week,” he said.\n\n“If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely.\n\n“This was understood, and will be moving forward as well.”\n\nBut being back in the office would make the business “better set up to invent, collaborate and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business”, Mr Jassy said. Amazon workers have held industrial action at the company’s Coventry site over the past year (Jacob King/PA)\n\nAmazon will also bring back assigned desks, replacing hot-desking, in offices that were organised that way prior to the pandemic, including its head offices in the US.\n\nElsewhere, the chief executive also said he wanted to cut down the number of managers across the group in order to reduce layers of bureaucracy.\n\nHaving too many managers was creating unnecessary processes, meetings and layers which “waste valuable time”, he argued.\n\nAmazon, like other tech companies, ramped up hiring during the pandemic to meet demand from people locked down at home who were increasingly shopping online.\n\nAmazon’s workforce, in warehouses and offices, doubled to more than 1.6 million people in about two years.\n\nMr Jassy said the firm wanted to increase the ratio of “individual contributors” to managers by at least 15% by April 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmanda Gearing, senior organiser for GMB, the trade union representing Amazon workers in the UK, said: “This is yet another example of how Amazon has won its reputation as one of the worst employers around.”\n\nShe said “record numbers” of staff were joining the union, after a ballot of workers at its Coventry site for union recognition failed to reach a majority in July.",

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Can you become a millionaire by investing in stocks? Absolutely. But there are a couple of key rules to follow. It's important to diversify your investments across a broad range of solid companies, and it's key to invest for the long term. You'll have a much better chance of reaching your goal if you hold on to quality stocks for a period of 10 years or longer than if you bail out after a few weeks or months.\n\nOf course, it's possible that even by following these guidelines you won't pocket millions -- but there's a very strong likelihood you'll still find yourself in a fantastic financial position down the road if you choose wisely now and stick with investing for the long haul.\n\nToday, a great way to offer your portfolio a boost or get started with a bang if you're new to investing is to buy a couple of leading technology stocks that are likely to continue their leadership well into the future. I'm thinking of two with terrific earnings and share performance track records, and plenty of potential ahead. These two players won't do the job alone -- but it's unlikely that any one stock will make you a millionaire unless you invest a tremendous amount in just that player. And that's much too risky. These top tech stockscould help make you a millionaire, though. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of my favorite tech stocks because of its diversification and leadership in two high-growth areas. The company dominates in both e-commerce and cloud computing. On top of this, Amazon also is on the road to becoming one of the biggest winners in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon's Prime subscription program and focus on keeping prices low and delivery fast should help it stay ahead. Annual sales events such as Prime Day help the company bring in new members -- and the member retention rate is high. Over the first three months of 2023, 99% of Prime members renewed their memberships for a second year, according to Statista. Since members pay for Prime, it's in their best interest to do as much of their shopping as possible on Amazon -- all of this points to more potential growth ahead.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader worldwide, and its focus on AI has already started to add even more growth to the picture. AWS recently reached an annual revenue run rate of $105 billion thanks to its AI products and services -- AWS offers everything from chips to a full service called Amazon Bedrock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese businesses have helped Amazon grow revenue and net income into the billions of dollars -- and the company's revamping of its cost structure a couple of years ago makes it more efficient than ever. All of this makes Amazon a no-brainer buy for your millionaire-maker portfolio.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), like Amazon, is a leader in its field. As owner of Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, the company is a social media giant. More than 3.2 billion people around the world use at least one of these apps every day.\n\nImportantly, Meta has a rock-solid moat, or competitive advantage, that should keep it in the top spot. It's very difficult for users to drop Facebook or WhatsApp, for example, because they know that if they do, many of their contacts won't be present on other platforms -- this offers confidence that Meta will maintain its leadership.\n\nBut Meta isn't relying on this moat alone. The company is working to make its social media apps better and better thanks to its focus on AI. The goal is to have an AI available to suit everyone's needs -- from professional to leisure -- down the road. Meta already launched its first AI assistant, backed by its own large language model, and has said that its biggest investment area this year is in AI.\n\nHow does all of this translate into earnings? Meta sells advertising to advertisers, who hope to reach all of us where they can find us: on Meta's apps. By making these apps better and better through AI, we'll use them more -- and advertisers may therefore spend more.\n\nAs it stands, advertising already has brought Meta billions of dollars in earnings. And the company even felt comfortable enough with its financial situation earlier this year to launch its first-ever dividend -- saying it can afford to both reward shareholders and invest in growth. So, through Meta, you can collect dividends, and benefit from what likely will be a long period of growth down the road.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nThe world's most valuable company Apple saw billions wiped off its market capitalisation on Monday, after an analyst warned of weak demand for its new iPhone 16.\n\nShares in the tech company were down nearly 3% at market close on Monday, taking its market valuation to $3.29tn (£2.49tn).\n\nTF International Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a post on Medium that he had calculated first-weekend pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 to be an estimated 37 million units, around 12.7% lower than first-weekend sales of the iPhone 15 last year.\n\nHe said: \"One of the key factors for the lower-than-expected demand for the iPhone 16 Pro series is that the major selling point, Apple Intelligence, is not available at launch alongside the iPhone 16 release.\"\n\nThe iPhone 16 is due to hit store shelves on 20 September, but its generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform Apple Intelligence is set to begin its rollout as a software update for US English users in October.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets higher as traders look to central bank decisions\n\nMaxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte told Yahoo Finance on Monday: \"I think the challenge for Apple, as reflected in those reports, is that they're trying to get a consumer to buy new hardware, which is coming out in the month of September.\n\n\"But the best-selling point for that hardware, especially for consumers in the US — Apple Intelligence, the AI-related features — those aren't coming out until beta next month.\"\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nThe world's second most valuable company Microsoft had a positive trading session on Monday, following the news that its board had approved a new share buyback programme of up to $60bn.\n\nThe company also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.83 per share, an increase of 10% on the previous quarter.\n\nShares closed Monday's session closed slightly higher and were up more than 1% in pre-market trading on Tuesday.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"The share buyback juggernaut has moved into the fast lane.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\n“While tech companies are increasingly paying more generous dividends to shareholders, their preferred method of deploying surplus cash is to buy back shares.\"\n\nWhen companies buy back shares this reduces the amount on the market, which boosts earnings per share and in turn, can drive the market value of a business higher.\n\nMould said: \"Fundamentally, investors love share buybacks. They particularly love them when they are least expected, which is certainly the case for Microsoft. One might have expected the tech giant to spend all its surplus cash on AI-related investments, but it is clearly balancing the needs of the business with keeping shareholders happy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nAnother tech company in the green was chipmaker Intel, with shares up more than 6% at Monday's close and up nearly 7% in pre-market trading.\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced in a memo to staff that it had agreed a deal to make custom chips for Amazon's (AMZN) web services business.\n\nGelsinger said the company planned to establish Intel Foundry, its contract manufacturing business, as an independent subsidiary business. Earlier this year, Intel said operating losses for the foundry business had deepened to $7bn in 2023.\n\nGelsinger also said the company was more than halfway to its targets of reducing its workforce by around 15,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nIntel has faced challenges this year, as it missed second-quarter estimates on sales, gross profit margins and earnings, citing challenging market conditions and higher-than-expected costs to increase production of its AI chips. The company also decided to suspend its dividend, which will come into effect in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nShares are still down 58% year-to-date, but the stock has ticked higher in the last couple of days, starting with news on Friday the European Commission had given Poland the green light to grant the company more than $1.9bn in state aid to support its chip assembly and testing plant.\n\nKingfisher (KGF.L)\n\nB&Q-owner Kingfisher surged nearly 7% on Tuesday morning, after the company posted a 2.3% rise in pre-tax profits in the first half of its year to £324m.\n\nThe DIY-chain owner also lifted its guidance for full-year adjusted pre-tax profits to a tighter range of between £510m and £550m, up from £490m to £550m.\n\nThierry Garnier, CEO of Kingfisher, said that, as anticipated, demand for \"big ticket\" items such as kitchens and bathrooms \"remained weak, in line with the broader market, while seasonal category sales trends have improved since early July\".\n\nThis latest update shows continued improvement on last autumn, when the company issued profit warnings in September and then November.\n\nRead more: Gold hits record high as investors anticipate major US Fed rate cut\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “Kingfisher has seen some home improvement of its own, with the UK and Ireland continuing to prop up the wider business against a generally tough European backdrop.\n\n\"In terms of the market consensus, the general view of the shares as a hold could conceivably come under some positive pressure should investors recognise an improving direction of travel.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Billionaire Dan Loeb Has 23% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 AI Stocks (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Dan Loeb is the founder and CEO of Third Point, an institutional asset manager whose flagship Offshore Fund has returned 13.1% annually since its inception in 1996. Meanwhile, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has returned 9.4% annually during the same period.\n\nLoeb is \"one of the most successful hedge fund managers of his generation,\" according to The Wall Street Journal. And while Third Point underperformed in 2022 and 2023, its long-term outperformance makes Loeb a good case study for investors.\n\nLoeb has compared artificial intelligence (AI) to disruptive technologies like the internet and smartphones, and AI a prevalent theme in his investments. Somewhat surprisingly, Third Point does not have a position in Nvidia, but it did have 23.1% of $8.7 billion portfolio invested in three AI stocks as of June:\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 11% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 8.1% Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM): 4%.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon: 11% of Dan Loeb's portfolio\n\nAmazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company has used the scope of its retail business to secure a strong presence in digital advertising. But its greatest opportunity to make money on artificial intelligence (AI) lies in its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and its market share increased one percentage point between the first and second quarters of 2024. That scale means AWS is uniquely positioned to benefit from AI simply because it already has such a large customer base, and they are more likely to lean on AWS for AI services when/if the need arises as opposed to working with a new cloud provider.\n\nAWS has also extended its ability to monetize AI with new products like coding assistant Amazon Q and generative AI development platform Amazon Bedrock. CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts, \"Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 25% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings look tolerable. I think that's a reasonable entry point for patient investors, and I would feel comfortable buying a small position in this stock today.\n\nMicrosoft: 8.4% of Dan Loeb's portfolio\n\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. New generative AI copilots for its business productivity and enterprise resource planning platforms are gaining traction. The number of workers that use Copilot for Microsoft 365 daily nearly doubled in the most recent quarter, and the total number of customers increased more than 60%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Azure is steadily gaining share in cloud services because of strength in cybersecurity, analytics, and artificial intelligence. Its partnership with OpenAI has been instrumental in attracting new customers. Azure is the only public cloud that allows developers to build generative AI applications with the large language models that power ChatGPT.\n\nLoeb wrote in a recent investor letter, \"This new technology favors incumbents who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race. Right now, what we see as the best-run 'legacy' companies like Microsoft and Amazon (both of which we own) have built enormous competitive advantages and seen their growth vectors accelerate.\"\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to grow at 13% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look rather expensive. I think Microsoft is a well-managed company with compelling growth prospects, but I would avoid the stock at its current price.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor: 4% of Dan Loeb's portfolio\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is the leading semiconductor foundry as measured by revenue. That gives the company an important advantage in a capital-intensive industry. TSMC's ability to outspend peers on R&D keeps it on the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing technology, sometimes called process technology.\n\nPhelix Lex at Morningstar highlighted that advantage in a recent note. To paraphrase his commentary: Process technology leadership means TSMC is consistently improving chip PPA (power, performance, and area), cost per chip, and time to market, all of which are essential for computing devices to be competitive. It also lets TSMC charge higher prices than its peers.\n\nTSMC's process technology leadership has also won the company high-profile customers like Apple, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Broadcom, which itself designs custom semiconductors for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. All of those companies are spending heavily on artificial intelligence, which benefits TSMC.\n\nDan Loeb explained his investment thesis in a recent investor letter:\n\n\"Google was the first mover to custom accelerators with the TPU almost 10 years ago, and today this is already a multi-billion dollar business for TSMC. Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have all followed Google's lead and have announced (and in Amazon's case already mass producing) their own chips. As these products scale, we see TSMC's AI revenue growing by multiples in the coming years.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects TSMC to grow earnings at 29% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 31 times earnings look reasonable. I would feel comfortable buying a small position in this stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Non-Tech Stocks With Long-Term Investment Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been desperately searching for a safer way to play the AI boom that has swept the US stock market over the past few months. Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs recently released an investor note detailing which sectors of the economy would benefit from the AI craze, replacing obvious bull cases in the technology domain by thoughtful insights on the long-term impact of AI on utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare. According to analysts at Goldman, AI tools looked set to help companies outside of the technology sector improve productivity and reduce labor costs. The investment titan detailed the insatiable appetite for AI, evidenced by NVIDIA becoming one of the valuable firms in the world over the past year, and noted that the market was yet to reward companies that have downstream AI exposure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in the investor note that the AI boom was likely to play out in four key phases. The first phase, per the analyst, had been focused on NVIDIA, the chipmaker that is at the forefront of AI data center build. Kostin detailed that the second phase was likely to be about companies building AI infrastructure. Some examples of this include semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security industries, as well as utilities. So far this year, the returns of stocks working in these industries have dwarfed the returns of the benchmark indexes. The third phase, continued the analyst, would be about companies able to put AI in their products and boost sales in the process. Kostin cautioned that these firms had lost ground against AI stocks in recent months.\n\nThe analyst claimed that firms falling in the fourth phase of the AI boom, ones who would enjoy productivity gains after adopting AI, had been ignored by the majority of the market so far. Kostin maintained that it was unclear when these downstream AI stocks, some of which are discussed in detail below, would rally and expand their earnings multiples, but stressed that this would happen eventually. The industrial sector highlights the Goldman theory in action. Since the start of 2023, industrial stocks have jumped close to 30% in value. Of these, the firms that are directly exposed to AI verticals have more than doubled in value. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 30% of industrial firms mentioned AI in their earnings reports, up from just 10% in the same period the preceding year.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): A Non-Tech Stock With Long-Term Investment Potential\n\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports reveal that Amazon will power the latest updates to Alexa, the virtual assistant it has been marketing for years, with the AI model of Anthropic, a California-based AI startup. The reports indirectly reveal the failure of in-house AI models at Amazon, with some sources that spoke to news agency Reuters claiming that the in-house AI models of Amazon have lag times of six or seven seconds and problems with consistency and accuracy. The ecommerce giant will charge $5 or $10 per month for advanced AI features in Alexa.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. Cantor Fitzgerald recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and $230 price target, citing retail margin expansion and AWS acceleration. The advisory said it saw a runway in both, but added that the magnitude was likely to moderate compared to trends over the past two years and the path was unlikely to be linear.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the 35 non-tech stocks with long-term investment potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among Cantor Fitzgerald’s Top Internet Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\n\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\n\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\n\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\n\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\n\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\n\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\n\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\n\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 308\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 23%\n\nCantor's Rating: Overweight\n\nCantor's Share Price Target: $230\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the global leader in eCommerce and a sizeable player in the cloud computing industry. Cantor has rated the stock as Overweight, based on optimism surrounding the two key businesses. For eCommerce, the firm believes that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can expand its margins in the future via growing revenue, while for cloud computing, it thinks that AWS has further room for growth. Like Alphabet, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is among the handful of companies with its own foundational AI model in the form of Claude. It allows the firm to take an end to end approach to AI, by operating in all layers of the AI stack. This includes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s in house processors for AI computing, its foundational model Claude, and the final application layer that not only allows it to improve its eCommerce marketing offerings but also enables it to compete in the high end cloud computing market with Microsoft and ChatGPT. Unlike Microsoft though, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s valuation is helped by its stable eCommerce model and removes some of the volatility associated with AI profitability from the shares.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\n\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\n\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\n\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\n\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\n\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\n\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\n\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\n\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow – requiring “Goldilocks” growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 308\n\nShare Price Target Upside: 13%\n\nShare Price Target: $210\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an eCommerce and cloud computing company. This enables it to benefit from the sizeable nature of the eCommerce industry and the high growth, high margin, and recurring revenue offered through cloud computing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates the eCommerce market through its market share which saw it attract 3.25 billion users to its website in June. This also provides a wide moat to the firm in the advertising business, as merchants are eager to sell and advertise their products on its platform. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also enjoys key operating advantages, as evidenced by the click to door speed of just 1.9 days for the firm as opposed to 4.4 days for the industry. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s resources have also enabled it to establish a strong footing in the AI industry as it is one of the few firms with a foundational AI model. The firm is operating on all three layers of the AI stack, from designing semiconductors to providing a platform for businesses to develop AI products and services. \"Amazon’s high-margin businesses continue to allow Amazon to drive greater profitability while still continuing to invest,\" believes Morgan Stanley. It adds that \"Advertising serves as a key area for both further growth potential and profitability flow-through.\"\n\nAlbyn Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\"In his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon's commitment to \"primitive services\" over the last 20 years – creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus).\n\nAmazon's dominance comes not just from its scale but also from a relentless “customer obsession,” exemplified by its focus on building services that empower customers. This positions Amazon to capture significant shares of the growing retail and cloud markets. With a 45% share of online retail, which only makes up 25% of total retail sales, Amazon is well-placed for growth. The company's expansion into the grocery sector, backed by investments in same-day delivery, shows promise. Currently, Amazon holds a 20% share of the grocery market, a segment that constitutes 34% of US retail sales but is only 12% penetrated. As online retail trends towards 40-50% penetration, Amazon's growth potential is meaningful. Similarly, in the cloud sector, only 10% of IT spending has shifted to the cloud, with AWS holding a 35% market share.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Andy Jassy’s return-to-office mandate shows how serious the Amazon culture mid-life crisis has gotten",
        "content": "For years, Amazon employees and executives have warned that the company’s unique corporate culture was starting to fray. The worries have crescendoed recently, as I reported in this deep Fortune investigation on the growing pains of Jeff Bezos’ famed leadership principles and management rules.\n\nOn Monday, Bezos successor Andy Jassy tacitly acknowledged this reality while proposing a pair of would-be silver bullets: a push to flatten the organization and reduce middle management layers and, most controversially, a five-day return-to-office mandate starting in January. Amazon has employed a hybrid work model in recent years, requiring in-office work three days a week since May of 2023.\n\n\"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,\" Jassy wrote. \"I’ve previously explained these benefits, but in summary, we’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.\"\n\nThe shift to full-time in-office work marks a major shift for Amazon employees that will please some and undoubtedly drive others from the company, employees told me today. It will serve as a first for a majority of current Amazon corporate employees who've never worked in an Amazon office full-time, while for long-time corporate employees, it will be the first time since the pandemic began five years ago that they to work alongside their colleagues on a daily basis.\n\nMore face-to-face time will no doubt help rebuild some of those muscles. Amazon insiders have lamented the difficulty of learning the nuances of Amazon's principles and practices during remote work.\n\nThe challenge for Jassy and his senior leadership team – or S-team – is that hybrid work is not the sole cause of the company's endangered corporate culture.\n\nThe loss of longtime talent, including the high-profile departures of veterans like former Amazon consumer business CEOs Dave Clark in 2022 and Jeff Wilke in 2021, as well as Bezos’ departure from the CEO role that same year, has significantly diluted the company's traditions, employees have said.\n\n“Culture takes active architecture and work,” a former Amazon vice president who worked at the company for more than 15 years told Fortune earlier this year. “There was nobody else left to teach [that],” the former exec added, in a nod to all the top leaders who have left the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpect some push-back\n\nJassy & Co. also face a reality that many employees already believed that the original three-day return-to-work mandate severed trust between leadership and the rank-and-file when it was instituted last year. At the time, more than 30,000 Amazon employees joined an internal Slack channel to discuss opposition to that move, with some helping to create a six-page memo — a prototypical Amazon document format — to lay out their concerns. Today, anger is a common emotion among those I've spoken with.\n\nStill others pointed to the addition of two new Leadership Principles in 2021 — “Strive to be Earth’s best employer” and “Success and scale bring broad responsibility” — as a turning point for how vague many employees thought the new rules, and how they diluted the other principles that came before them.\n\n“They are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,” one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune earlier this year. “Total bullshit,” was how a former longtime communications employee at Amazon who was still at the company at the time summed them up, saying the new maxims were “playing the reputational game versus guiding how you think.”\n\nAgain, today's announcement won't cure any of this. If anything, employees who spoke to Fortune on Monday expressed a belief that the new mandate actively goes against the idea of a \"best employer.\"\n\nAll of that said, there is another component of Jassy's announcement that the CEO hopes will revitalize some of the deficiencies in the corporate culture.\n\n\"[W]e’re asking each...organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025,\" Jassy wrote. \"Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day.\"\n\nIn recent years, many company employees have told me that middle management became bloated as hiring dramatically increased between 2019 and 2021. Even with the layoffs of tens of thousands of corporate employees under Jassy, the problem festered, employees have told Fortune. During those intense hiring cycles, thousands of managers and executives not steeped in the Amazon Way joined the company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Amazon's purge of middle managers, via the new manager-contributor ratios, increase its decision-making and innovation metabolism. The unintended consequences of such a move will also be worth watching.\n\nEither way, Jassy is making a calculated bet that a controversial kick in the pants will recharge Amazon's cherished culture. But the risks are very real.\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co. claimed the top prize at the 2024 Emmy Awards, winning best drama for Shogun, an adaptation of James Clavell’s 1975 novel and the first series in a language other than English to claim that prize.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPipeline Fire Near Houston Forces Some Residents to Evacuate Housing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nFilmed primarily in Japanese, Shogun set a record for the most wins by a single show in one year, with 18 across the prime-time Emmys and the prior week’s Creative Arts awards. It won four awards at Sunday night’s ceremony, including for acting and directing. The show debuted on the FX cable network and streamed on Hulu, making it the first program from a Disney network to win best drama since Lost in 2005.\n\n“You greenlit a very expensive, subtitled Japanese period piece,” co-creator Justin Marks said from the stage, addressing top Disney executives in the audience. “I have no idea why you did that, but thank you.”\n\nDisney won nine awards on the night in all, including four for the dark comedy The Bear, outpacing Netflix Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. Netflix took home the Emmy for best limited series for Baby Reindeer, while Warner Bros.’ HBO landed best comedy series for Hacks.\n\nDominating the TV industry’s biggest night will boost Disney as it tries to grow its streaming services. While the company has the largest paid streaming video business after Netflix, it is still working to sustain a profit and increase its share of viewership. The company accounted for more than half of the nominees for best comedy with The Bear, What We Do in the Shadows, Only Murders in the Building, Abbott Elementary and Reservation Dogs.\n\nCompanies such as Disney, Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. spend millions of dollars on campaigns to win awards, which boost their networks in the eyes of Hollywood creative talent and viewers. While less popular than the Oscars, the Emmys still draw millions of viewers each year.\n\nRead the full list of winners here\n\nABC, which aired the Emmys, said on Monday that the show attracted a US TV audience of 6.87 million viewers, the most since 2021. The previous show, held in January after crippling strikes by actors and writers in 2023, drew a record low audience of 4.46 million.\n\nComic actor Eugene Levy and his son Dan Levy hosted the 76th Prime-Time Emmy Awards. The event took place at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth Shogun and The Bear, about a struggling restaurant in Chicago, originated with FX, the cable network and studio led by John Landgraf. Landgraf has long competed with HBO, Showtime, Netflix and Amazon for cultural supremacy, releasing a steady stream of critically beloved shows despite spending less than most of his competitors.\n\nDisney acquired FX as part of its deal for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox entertainment assets. Shogun, which follows an English sailor in his dealings with a Japanese feudal lord and one of his top deputies, was in development before Disney acquired FX. The show was first adapted for TV in 1980 when NBC made a five-part miniseries that won best limited series.\n\nThe latest take on the novel was created by the husband and wife team of Marks and Rachel Kondo. The show was initially supposed to be a limited series. But its popularity with critics and viewers convinced FX and the creators to cook up a second season. Shogun beat out seven other shows for best drama, including Slow Horses, Fallout and The Crown.\n\nThough The Crown only won one award in last night’s show for for its final season, Netflix captured six awards in all, thanks to Baby Reindeer, a British thriller about a stalker that Richard Gadd created based on his one-man show. Gadd also won for his writing and acting in the limited series.\n\n“Ten years ago I was down and out. I never thought I’d be able to get my life together,” Gadd said. “Here I am, just over a decade later, picking up one of the biggest writing awards in TV.”\n\nGadd implored TV networks to take more risks in storytelling despite challenging circumstances.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) a Good Big Tech Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big tech stocks.\n\nThe State of Big Tech Right Now\n\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\n\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of  AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\n\nHow Is Big Tech Impacting Other Sectors?\n\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\n\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\n\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a reputable big tech company operating in the e-commerce space. It is based in Seattle, Washington.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been entering the generative AI space, which has created a lot of hype around the stock over the past two years. This hype also seems to have some substance since more and more customers are now using the company's AI tools and finding value in them. The primary indicator of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI-driven growth can be seen in its Amazon Web Services business.\n\nIn the second quarter, AWS saw sales growth rise to 18.8% year-over-year. This business is also currently the leading cloud platform, with a 31% market share in cloud computing, well ahead of Microsoft's Azure with its 25% share and Google Cloud with its 11% share. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a lot more to look forward to outside of AI since it has been focusing on advertising for quite some time now, and ad revenues saw a 20% rise year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nIn total, 308 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with a total stake value of $65.8 billion.\n\nHayden Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Our portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we’ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today\n\nSome of our biggest winners in the last two years, have been “re-acceleration” stories. These are cases where once rapidly growing companies suddenly put the brakes on during a weak economy. There could be several reasons for this – customers pulling back during a recession, the company proactively curtailing growth spend as a precaution, needing to cut costs & right-size the business to become profitable quickly, or many other reasons.\n\nBut the commonality seems to be that as soon as growth stops, the market narrative turns suddenly from positive, to “this company is finished”. They go from being valued for many years of rapid growth, to being priced like a mature company that will never realize significant growth again. But often neither scenario is true, with the ultimate future path somewhere in between.\n\nI find the fact this type of opportunity even exists, fascinating. Especially since it seems to happen every bear-market – perhaps indicating it’s embedded in human nature (and thus persistent & likely minable throughout one’s investing career). For example, I gave the examples of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock performance in our Q1 2022 letter (please re-read this piece for more context; LINK)…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Nvidia's AI Surge Powers 25% of S&P 500 Gains in 2024, Makes Co-founder Huang Among Fastest Growing: Report\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) rally disproportionately influences the S&P 500 index, reflecting concerns over the domino effect due to the integrated semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nNvidia accounted for 25% of the S&P 500’s 17% gain in 2024, Reuters reports.\n\nThe chip designer has risen by 166% in the last 12 months as Big Techs, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), splurge on their artificial intelligence ambitions.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Gains Ground in AI Chip Market, Oracle Exec Confirms Growing Demand: Report\n\nThe rising valuation of NvidiaNVIDIA in 2024 has helped boost the wealth of Jensen Huang, the co-founder and CEO of the company that was once created inside a Denny’s restaurant.\n\nHuang has a wealth of $90.5 billion, ranking 18th according to Bloomberg. While Huang hasn’t cracked the top 10 list yet and would currently need to hit a wealth of $130 billion, the Nvidia co-founder is one of the fastest risers among the world’s richest people. Huang’s wealth is up $46.4 billion year-to-date in 2024.\n\nThat figure is more than the combined $41.83 billion gained by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Musk, Bezos and Gates currently rank first, second and fifth, respectively, with their current wealth and year-to-date gains.\n\nElon Musk: $237 billion, +$7.73 billion year-to-date Jeff Bezos: $195 billion, +$17.9 billion year-to-date Bill Gates: $157 billion, +$16.2 billion year-to-date\n\nThe gain by Huang is one of the largest year-to-date gains, trailing only Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who is up $49.9 billion and listed fourth at $178 billion.\n\nIt’s not just personal wealth – due to the AI frenzy, Huang expects hyper-scale customers to produce $5 in rental revenue for every $1 spent on Nvidia’s infrastructure. He also reiterated that Blackwell-based products will ship in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia stock losing value would impact the S&P500 and Huang’s wealth. However, Huang had snubbed geopolitical tensions surrounding supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), voicing the possibility of switching suppliers.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia have a combined weighting of 20% in the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 31%, and Apple has risen 22% in the last 12 months as they remain invested in their AI goals.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia and the S&P 500 through SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock closed lower by 1.95% to $116.78 on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s Strong August Sales Hint at Big Gains Ahead, AI and iPhone Demand Fuel Optimism\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "Intel to Make Custom AI Chip for Amazon, Delay German Plant",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has landed Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS as a customer for the company’s manufacturing business, potentially bringing work to new plants under construction in the US and boosting his efforts to turn around the embattled chipmaker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nEnergy Transfer Says Blast Occurred on Texas NGL Line Housing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever An Artist Reimagines the Spaces of Childhood, With Thorny Results\n\nIntel and AWS will coinvest in a custom semiconductor for artificial intelligence computing – what’s known as a fabric chip – in a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar framework,” according to a statement Monday. The work will rely on Intel’s 18A process, an advanced chipmaking technology.\n\nThe shares jumped almost 10% in late trading after the announcement. They had been down 58% this year, closing at $20.91 on Monday.\n\n“Today’s announcement is big,” Gelsinger said in an interview. “This is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities.”\n\nThe news was part of a flurry of announcements that followed a pivotal board meeting last week. Intel also is postponing new factories in Germany and Poland, but remains committed to its US expansion in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio.\n\nGelsinger, who embarked on a bold comeback effort for Intel in 2021, has had to scale back some of his ambitions in the name of efficiency. With sales shrinking and losses piling up, the company announced plans last month to slash 15,000 workers, find $10 billion in cost savings and suspend Intel’s dividend. Now he’s going further to rein in expansion plans, especially overseas.\n\nThe Poland and Germany construction projects will be paused for about two years depending on market demand. Another one in Malaysia will be completed but only put into operation when conditions support it, Intel said.\n\nAt last week’s three-day board meeting, executives presented options on how to conserve cash while keeping Gelsinger’s turnaround plan on track. The CEO’s effort hinges on transforming Intel into a so-called foundry, a chipmaker that manufacturers products for outside customers. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been slow to line up customers for the project — and a high-profile client such as Amazon represents a notable win.\n\nIntel also is looking to speed up efforts to execute the $10 billion in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing, an area where rival Nvidia Corp. has excelled.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, and it could help build confidence that Intel can compete with the likes of foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. AWS has used Intel processors over the years, but has been shifting more toward in-house designs — the very products that Intel may now help manufacture.\n\nMicrosoft Corp., another major cloud-computing provider, announced plans in February to use Intel for some of its in-house chips as well.\n\nAnother change: Intel’s foundry operations, referred to as IFS, will be further separated from the rest of the company and become a wholly owned subsidiary. That move is aimed in part at convincing prospective customers — some of whom compete with Intel — that they are dealing with an independent supplier.\n\n“We still have things to learn about becoming a foundry,” Gelsinger said in the interview. “I need lots of customers.”\n\nIn another win, Intel said earlier Monday that it’s eligible to receive as much as $3 billion in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military. The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes. That news helped send the shares up 6.4% in regular trading Monday.\n\nIntel still has a long way to go to win back Wall Street’s confidence. After years of losing ground to rivals and seeing its technological edge slip, the Silicon Valley pioneer is valued at less than $90 billion. It no longer ranks as one of the top 10 chipmakers on that basis. Nvidia, meanwhile, now has a market capitalization of about $2.9 trillion.\n\nIntel shocked investors with a bleak financial report last month, triggering the biggest single-day stock decline in decades. Analysts described the announcement as Intel’s worst-ever earnings report.\n\n(Updates with late trading in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Under CEO Andy Jassy, the company has shifted its focus to higher-margin services, scaling AI across AWS and lessening its reliance on first-party retail sales.\n\nAWS is arguably Amazon’s most important business unit, boasting an impressive operating profit margin of 35.5%. Although the current margin is down slightly from 37.6% in the previous quarter, it remains nearly 40 times more profitable than Amazon’s international segment, which has operating margins of 0.9%.\n\nAWS supports open-source projects and tools, and is popular for its flexibility, scalable infrastructure, and AI services. As enterprises increasingly adopt open-source models, AWS could gain a competitive edge and better protect its market share. AWS’ net sales growth has accelerated from 12% to 19% over the past four quarters, with Q2 2024 revenues reaching $26.3 billion and an annual run rate of $105.2 billion.\n\nIs AMZN Stock A Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nThe consensus among Wall Street analysts is that AMZN stock is a Strong Buy. Currently, 42 of 43 analysts rate the stock a Buy. There is one Hold rating on the stock and no Sell ratings. The average price target of $222.88 suggests potential upside of 20.68% based on the current share price.\n\nBank of America (BAC) analyst Justin Post points to the upcoming 2025 partnership between Oracle’s (ORCL) databases and AWS applications, which could drive increased demand for cloud infrastructure and applications using Oracle’s databases—an area where the two companies previously competed.\n\nRead more analyst ratings of AMZN stock\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nMy bullish stance on Alphabet is based on the rapid growth of Google Cloud and its improving margins. Currently, Google Cloud holds an 11% share of the cloud computing market. However, it is the fastest-growing among the three major players.\n\nOne of Google Cloud’s key strengths is its integration with other Google services, such as AI-driven applications and Google Workspace. This synergy enables Google Cloud to offer a strong suite of solutions in areas such as automation, cybersecurity, and productivity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q2 of this year, Google Cloud’s revenue increased 29% to $10.3 billion, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. However, Alphabet’s Cloud segment reported operating margins of 11.3% last quarter. While this was an improvement, it is still significantly lower than AWS’ margin of 35.5%. Enhancing these margins should be a top priority at Alphabet.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock A Buy Or Sell?\n\nWall Street is also bullish on Alphabet. The consensus view is that GOOGL stock is a Strong Buy, with 27 out of 36 analysts saying the shares are a Buy. The other nine analysts rate the stock a Hold. There are no Sell ratings on the stock currently. The average price target of $203.72 implies upside potential of 29% from current levels.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) analyst Eric Sheridan highlights that Alphabet’s focus on balancing growth with cost discipline should lead to steady margin expansion within the cloud segment.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on GOOGL stock\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nI also rate Microsoft’s stock a Buy based on the success of the company’s Azure cloud unit. Azure’s market share has steadily grown to 25%, making it Amazon’s closest competitor. This growth is largely attributed to Microsoft’s strong enterprise relationships. Azure’s integration with Microsoft’s other enterprise products—such as Office 365, Dynamics, and LinkedIn—makes it an attractive option for businesses that already use Microsoft’s ecosystem.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that Azure’s growth slowed in the company’s most recent quarter. The server products and cloud services revenue category reached $28.5 billion in revenue, an 18% year-over-year increase. That growth was slower than the 24% annualized increase recorded in the previous quarter and negatively impacted Microsoft’s overall earnings.\n\nMicrosoft was the only major player in the cloud sector to experience a slowdown in revenue growth, while AWS and Google Cloud grew their revenues. Regardless, Microsoft still leads its peers with the highest operating margins, boasting an impressive 45%.\n\nIs MSFT A Buy According to Wall Street Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish on Microsoft, giving the stock a consensus Strong Buy rating. Currently, 29 out of 30 analysts rate the stock a Buy. The other analyst rates it a Hold. As with Amazon and Alphabet, there are no Sell ratings on Microsoft’s stock. The average price target of $501.15 suggests potential upside of 16.3%.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Keith Weiss points out that Azure is growing faster when considered separately from other Microsoft services. He expects Azure to experience significant growth in the second half of this year due to reduced capacity constraints.\n\nRead more analyst ratings on MSFT stock\n\nConclusion – Amazon Web Services Is the Best Choice\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud service boasts the best operating margins, despite a slowdown in growth in the last quarter. Google Cloud, while having the lowest operating margins and smallest market share, is experiencing the fastest growth. However, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands out with the biggest market share, strong operating margins, and accelerating growth. Given Amazon’s sizable cloud ecosystem and strong financial metrics, it represents the strongest investment opportunity in cloud computing today.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

The policy takes effect on January 2, 2025.\n\nLike many other companies, Amazon’s corporate employees worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the company saw massive gains from a boost in online shopping. In 2021, the tech giant implemented a policy that allowed leaders to determine how their teams worked.\n\nIn February 2023, Amazon asked all employees to come back to the office for three mandatory days, resulting in some protests from workers.\n\nA few months later, Jassy said employees who were not happy about the change should learn to “disagree and commit.” He also issued somewhat of a subtle threat, saying it was “probably not going to work out” for those who refused to do so.\n\nIn his note on Monday, Jassy said the company has observed that it is easier for employees to “learn, model, practice and strengthen” Amazon’s culture and brainstorm when they’re together in person.\n\n“If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,” he said.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon orders staff back to the office five days a week",
        "content": "Andy Jassy pledged to cut down on unnecessary layers of middle management - Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nAmazon is to make its white-collar workers turn up at the office five days a week, as tech giants increasingly try to cajole workers back to the office.\n\nIn a message sent to Amazon employees on Monday, Andy Jassy, the e-commerce titan’s chief executive, said that being in the office helped staff “deliver the absolute best for customers and the business” by being “joined at the hip with your teammates”.\n\nThe requirement will apply to employees from Jan 2, except those working from offices that “had agile desk arrangements before the pandemic”.\n\nPreviously, Amazon had made employees visit the office at least three days a week, which the company said “has strengthened our conviction about the benefits” of being physically at work.\n\nMr Jassy, who joined Amazon in 1997, also pledged to cut down on unnecessary layers of middle management. He said that the business would “increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15pc” by the end of March 2025.\n\n“Having fewer managers will remove layers,” he added. “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our … ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day.”\n\nIt comes months after Mr Jassy wrote a memo pointing out the problems with working from home. At the time, he said: “When you’re in-person, people tend to be more engaged, observant, and attuned to what’s happening in the meetings and the cultural clues being communicated.\n\n“For those unsure about why something happened or somebody reacted a certain way, it’s easier to ask ad-hoc questions on the way to lunch, in the elevator, or the hallway; whereas when you’re at home, you’re less likely to do so.\n\n“It’s also easier for leaders to teach when they have more people in a room at one time, [they] can better assess whether the team is digesting the information as intended; and if not, [decide] how they need to adjust their communication.”\n\nAmazon’s push to get workers back to the offices comes amid attempts by other tech giants, including Google, Meta and Apple to clamp down on home working. Last year, Fiona Cicconi, Google’s chief people officer, said: “There’s just no substitute for coming together in person.”",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is ordering the e-commerce company’s employees to return to working in the office five days a week beginning in January and said the company will seek to reduce management layers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads Houston Suburb Fights Pipeline Fire That Forced an Evacuation\n\nPreviously, Amazon had required employees to badge in at least three days, depending on the requirements of their team. Amazon’s return to office plans will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or cases where managers had already approved a fully remote position, Jassy said in a note to employees on Monday.\n\n“We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” Jassy said in the message, which was also posted on Amazon’s corporate blog.\n\nJassy is also taking aim at bureaucracy and layers of management after Amazon ballooned in size during the last decade. Stories of endless deliberation on memos, unnecessary meetings and layers of approval have become commonplace at a company that fashions itself as a collection of teams charged with operating like startups.\n\nEach major organization within Amazon will be required to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of March 2025, Jassy said. He also announced a bureaucracy tipline for employees to raise concerns about unnecessary processes.\n\n“Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” Jassy wrote. “You have to work at it all the time.”\n\n(Updates with details on the announcement beginning in the third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool To Catch Up in EVs, Detroit Needs to Invite China In Israeli Budget Brawl Shows Gaza War Splintering the Nation College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cellebrite DI Ltd; Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nPathfinder’s capabilities are now available via the cloud, giving law enforcementnew deployment options to accelerate justice\n\nTYSONS CORNER, Va. and PETAH TIKVA, Israel, Sept. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellebrite (Nasdaq: CLBT), a global leader in premier Digital Investigative solutions for the public and private sectors, announced today Pathfinder in the Cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS) (Nasdaq: AMZN), allowing customers to access Cellebrite’s industry-leading investigative analytics solution, Pathfinder, through the secure Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n\nNow available for on-premises and cloud use, Pathfinder drastically reduces the hours investigators and analysts spend on cases because its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities help to swiftly identify meaningful data and connections across multiple devices. It identifies slang and terms associated with criminal activity and allows investigators to search for and categorize explicit images – lessening the volume of exposure to disturbing imagery and audio. With Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Pathfinder also makes data easily searchable as it scans and converts text from images and devices. Additionally, with Cellebrite Pathfinder's Automated Translation Services, law enforcement agencies can quickly overcome language barriers, gaining rapid access to critical data and insights from digital evidence in multiple languages.\n\nPathfinder in the Cloud with AWS, part of Cellebrite’s Case-to-Closure (C2C) platform, helps agencies of all sizes eliminate both the need to purchase and maintain physical servers as well as the common reliance on dedicated server rooms and sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) secure rooms. With this update, customers can now quickly scale storage and resources based on demand, while preserving resources as they only pay for what is needed.\n\nOther key capabilities of Pathfinder in the AWS cloud include:\n\nRapid Resource Commissioning: With the cloud, organizations can rapidly commission and decommission resources as needed, compared to the longer lead times for resource provisioning that traditional on-premises setups require. High Availability and Redundancy: Amazon VPC provides customers with high availability, uptime redundancy and failover capabilities with robust data security and business continuity, eliminating the need to invest in high-availability infrastructure. Flexible Infrastructure and Security and Compliance: Customers can tailor their infrastructure, security and compliance controls to align with their organization’s requirements, all without the use of physical hardware.\n\n“Law enforcement agencies and public safety organizations stand to gain significantly from using investigative analytics solutions in the cloud,” stated Cam Cowdery, Detective at the Nampa, Idaho Police Department and Member of the Treasure Valley Digital Forensic Task Force. “Merging the adaptability of a secure virtual private cloud with Pathfinder’s AI-driven analytical capabilities allows examiners, investigators and detectives to access evidence more swiftly and resolve cases more rapidly.”\n\n“As digital evidence continues to increase in volume and complexity, it’s critical that investigators have access to a secure and AI-powered cloud solution that meets their organization’s requirements,” said Ronnen Armon, Chief Products and Technologies Officer, Cellebrite. “Pathfinder leverages Amazon VPC to empower agencies to quickly and cost-effectively scale their resources and infrastructure to meet evolving needs and accelerate digital evidence analysis.”\n\nTo learn more about Cellebrite Pathfinder, visit https://cellebrite.com/en/pathfinder/.\n\n###\n\nAbout Cellebrite\n\nCellebrite’s (Nasdaq: CLBT) mission is to enable its customers to protect and save lives, accelerate justice and preserve privacy in communities around the world.

Previously, the mining company had warned against a possible rise in copper prices as the demand outweighed supply.\n\nAlso Read: BHP Averts Strike At World’s Largest Copper Mine, Stabilizes Chinese Copper Supply\n\nCopper is indispensable for industries pivotal to the zero-emission target, including power cables, electric vehicles, and solar farms. Therefore, a crisis in the metal could hamper the prospects of companies ranging from Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to EV companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and more lest Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), fails to supply AI chips to the Big Techs due to the copper crisis.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Patrick Jones projected a four million metric tonnes copper deficit by 2030, courtesy of EVs and renewable energy demand. The analyst also blamed China’s weak demand, which accounts for over 50% of global copper demand.\n\nBHP Group’s copper production rose 9% in fiscal 2024 for the second successive year, reaching 1.9 million tons. The average realized copper prices increased in fiscal 2024.\n\nBHP Group has snapped a 50% stake in Argentina’s Filo del Sol and Josemaria copper projects, which have the potential to help accomplish a 70% increase in global copper demand by 2050.\n\nBHP Group expects the production to grow by another 4% in fiscal 2025, reaching 1.85 million tons–2.05 million tons.\n\nBHP Group’s stock has been down close to 14% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through the Avantis International Equity ETF (NYSE:AVDTHE) and Dimensional International Core Equity Market ETF (NYSE:DFAI).\n\nPrice Action: BHP stock is up 0.42% at $53.11 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBHP To Unlock South American Copper Riches: Partners With Lundin For Filo Acquisition\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Washington’s envisioned clampdown on the tax-free import of Chinese goods imposes one more layer of uncertainty on consumer-sector mavens from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Temu who are already struggling to cope with a consumer crisis back home.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race An Affordable Nomadic Home Design Struggles to Adapt to Urban Life US Driving and Congestion Rates Are Higher Than Ever A City Finds Success Using 'Trees as Medicine' The Hague Is World’s First City to Ban Oil and Air Travel Ads\n\nAlibaba and smaller rival JD.com Inc. sagged about 2% in Hong Kong Monday, as investors parsed the potential fallout from US plans to begin taxing packages worth less than $800. That all but slams shut a loophole that PDD Holdings Inc.’s Temu and fashion-focused competitor Shein have employed for years to ship hundreds of millions of packages into the US annually, carving out a market at the expense of Amazon.com Inc. PDD slid 2.4% Friday.\n\nThe move threatens to reshape parts of the US retail arena and deflate the excitement that’s accompanied the meteoric ascent of bargain bazaars like Temu, Shein and Alibaba’s Aliexpress. It also hit shares of other US-reliant retailers such as Australian fashion outlet Cettire Ltd. on Monday.\n\nBut analysts expect Shein and Temu to take the brunt of the crackdown, depending on the extent and size of tariffs set.\n\n“While the market has been expecting the US Administration might announce action to change/reform the de minimis exemption, it was still considered as a negative development,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a research note. “The lack of visibility on implementation timing and potential impact will remain an overhang to share price performance near term.”\n\nWhite House officials on Friday announced they intend to propose rules that would rein in use of the so-called de minimis exemption, which allows products worth less than $800 to go directly to consumers without customs declarations or duties. The measures are aimed at reducing tariff evasion and preventing fentanyl-laced shipments.\n\nInvestors have braced for the move for some time. The European Commission has kept the ultra-fast-fashion industry in its sights since at least 2021, when President Ursula von der Leyen denounced it as “poison” due to the environmental impact of disposable clothes. US officials also worry about the prospect of other illegal items — like drugs — slipping into the country.\n\nInvestors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude for now, though the impact is expected to be broad. Amazon, for instance, has come under pressure from Temu and Shein — so much so that it’s developing a discount marketplace on its platform for Chinese merchants to ship direct to the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nShein, which is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the Chinese apparel giant north of $60 billion, pioneered the model of targeting cost-conscious Americans with $2 blouses and $10 shirts during Covid. Temu jumped in around 2022 with its “Shop Like a Billionaire” catchphrase, rapidly becoming one of PDD’s biggest growth drivers worldwide.\n\nAnalysts estimate Temu accounts for a low-teen percentage of PDD’s overall business — though a large chunk of that is from the US. Temu likely handled about $20 billion of gross merchandise volume in the first half of 2024, of which about 40% came from America, Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong estimates. And the explosive growth that crowned PDD a market darling is already showing signs of petering out, hammered by China’s unrelenting consumer downturn.\n\nAs for Shein, it can ill-afford any uncertainty ahead of its market debut. And both are coming under intensifying scrutiny in the US, as its relationship with China comes into focus ahead of the November elections.\n\n“Geopolitical risks have long been a concern to investors, in particular the tariff issue related to cross-border e-commerce,” Chong wrote. “Compared to overseas peers, we expect Temu to maintain pricing advantage, as the former do not charge commissions and operate on a low-price model.”\n\n--With assistance from Catherine Ngai.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid EV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots The Vegas Sphere’s First Live Sporting Event Will Be an Expensive One China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $200 Right Now",
        "content": "If you're looking for a growth stock to help you build wealth for retirement, it's not enough to just pick a stock of any growing company that is regularly hitting new highs. There are other important qualities you want to look for.\n\nObviously, you want a company with outstanding growth prospects, but it's also beneficial to invest in a business that has a loyal base of customers that regularly spend money with the company. This adds resiliency to the business, especially during recessions and bear markets.\n\nOne company that immediately comes to mind is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here are three reasons why.\n\n1. Repeat revenue from millions of customers\n\nAmazon has millions of retail customers that regularly use their Prime membership to order multiple items every month. Statista estimates the U.S. Prime member count at 167 million, and over 200 million worldwide, with an estimated 42% of U.S. Prime members making between two and four purchases every month. That's a big reason why Amazon has grown into a massive business with $604 billion in trailing-12-month revenue as of June 30, 2024.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Amazon generated $42 billion from subscriptions and $237 billion from its online store. The company has continued to expand its same-day delivery and grocery delivery to Prime members, which shows the potential to find more ways to increase purchase frequency and grow revenue.\n\nAmazon also generates repeat revenue from its enterprise cloud service. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud computing provider in the world, with millions of customers in over 190 countries. AWS contributes less than 20% of Amazon's total revenue, but importantly, it's the most profitable business, contributing around two-thirds of the company's operating profit.\n\n2. Amazon has tremendous growth opportunities\n\nAmazon's online store and cloud business have a huge market to expand into that can keep the company growing for decades.\n\nThe global e-commerce market is set to reach $6 trillion this year, according to eMarketer. It's expected to reach $8 trillion by 2028, so Amazon has the benefit of chasing a growing market.\n\nAs for AWS, the opportunity is even more lucrative for shareholders. Revenue from AWS grew 19% year over year last quarter, reaching $98 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. However, it's estimated that at least 80% of enterprise data has yet to move from on-premises servers to the cloud.\n\nWith that much opportunity, AWS could grow into a very large business one day -- potentially Amazon's largest revenue source. The high margins from cloud services would significantly increase Amazon's profitability and send the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. The stock has great upside potential\n\nAmazon always looks expensive on the basis of price-to-earnings. That's because management doesn't manage the business to maximize earnings per share but to maximize long-term cash flows from operations.\n\nUsing Amazon's cash from operations (CFO) per share, the stock trades at a price-to-CFO multiple of 18.4. Despite the stock doubling in value in the last five years, it is trading at the lowest P/CFO valuation in over 10 years. AMZN data by YCharts.\n\nAmazon's cash from operations has tripled in the last five years to $107 billion. In the chart, notice how the stock has soared in value as it followed the growth in the company's cash from operations, but the shares continue to trade within the same range on a P/CFO basis. With the opportunities Amazon has in e-commerce and cloud services, its cash from operations will continue to grow over time, and that likely means more new highs for the share price.\n\nThe stock is currently trading slightly off its recent high of $201, so for an investor that only has a few hundred dollars, now is a great opportunity to buy it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Weighs in on Celsius Holdings (CELH): Confusion Amidst Sales Shortfall",
        "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer’s Exclusive List: 10 Stocks You Should Keep an Eye On. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) stands against Jim Cramer's other stocks to keep an eye on.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed frustration with analysts who attempt to explain stock movements during each trading session without acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the market and those who trade stocks for a living. He noted that while the Dow rose by 125 points, the S&P increased by 1.07%, and the NASDAQ jumped 2.17%, these gains resulted from conflicting market perceptions. Only one view can hold up in the end, and the process restarts the next day.\n\n“Okay, look, it keeps happening, and it’s beginning to drive me even crazier than I already am. I’m talking about analysts attempting to explain why stocks do what they do in any given session without taking into account the capriciousness, if not the lunacy, of those who trade stocks for a living.\n\nSure, the averages appear to tell a decent story. The Dow inching up 125 points, the S&P climbing 1.07%, and the NASDAQ vaulting 2.17%, but those percentages are the product of a furious battle between competing visions of reality. And only one vision can survive.\n\nCramer explained that the day saw the release of an important, though not game-changing, Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, just days before an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut. With market tensions high, the inline CPI data didn’t surprise anyone. However, Cramer pointed out that despite the CPI meeting expectations, stock futures remained down early in the day. When the market opened, stocks continued to drop, confusing commentators. Some analysts attributed the selloff to disappointment over the possibility of only a quarter-point rate cut rather than a half-point cut. Cramer was shocked by this explanation, calling it inaccurate.\n\n“Only one vision can hold up under close scrutiny before it all starts over again the next morning. Today, like many days, we got a somewhat crucial set of figures from the government. This time it was for the Consumer Price Index. Notice I said “somewhat” crucial because we’re now just days away from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where we’re likely to get a rate cut. Any session between now and then could be an outlier that might alter the Fed’s core mindset.\n\nWhen you’re in Fed mode, as we are, you know that tensions are heightened, which is why it was good to see a basically in-line CPI reading— nothing important, nothing shocking, just a number we all expected. So, we’ll probably get the quarter-point rate cut that we’re looking for. But next, you know, various speakers and interviews started ginning up reasons to explain why the Dow had dropped more than 700 points in the first hour of trading, and the NASDAQ was off 1.5%.\n\nThe pontificators were frantic. After a few tries, they settled on a new narrative that we had to listen to for a couple of hours. Many people were banking on a half-point rate cut, they said, and this 2.5% inflation number made a double rate cut very unlikely. We were told that led to disappointment and then furious selling of stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer mentioned an earlier interview with Doug Yearley, CEO of Toll Brothers, who had a positive outlook on the housing market, expecting it to strengthen further if rates were cut. Cramer believed the upcoming rate cuts could spark a housing boom, which would benefit the broader economy. Confident in this view, Cramer and his colleague Jeff Marks, during their CNBC Investing Club show, expressed confusion over the market’s decline, with Cramer even predicting that the averages could end the day higher, though that didn’t materialize.\n\n“Now, I was aghast. Can I just say? I was aghast at this wholesale license of the truth. I had just come from an interview with Doug Yearley on Squawk on the Street. He told me the business had gotten very strong in August and September and could only get stronger as rates fell. Doug is a straight shooter, not a lot of fluff, but he basically said, “Look out if rates go down from here.”\n\nHe was effusively, empirically positive on the coming rate cuts. He and I are both students of financial history, and these rate cuts, 25 basis points at a time, could ignite housing sales. That’s huge for the business of our country, even though housing is only 10% of the economy. It’s connected to so many other areas that I always like to say it punches above its weight. So I figured it was time to commit heresy.”\n\nCramer criticized the notion that the market’s decline was due to disappointment over the CPI reading, calling it “nonsense.” He argued that sellers were misjudging the situation and misunderstanding the potential power of rate cuts. For him, there’s no harm in calling out irrational behavior in the market and stating that sellers were clueless in this instance. He dismissed the idea of inventing justifications for market actions, especially when they clearly didn’t make sense.\n\n“I predicted that the average could actually finish up but it didn’t happen. I refused to dignify the musings of commentators who clung to the fiction that bulls were disappointed by the CPI reading. I knew the early action was just nonsense. Furthermore, I knew the sellers were wrong.\n\nWhat’s wrong with honestly stating the sellers are clueless and don’t understand the power of rate cuts? Why can’t I do that? Where does it say we always have to be descriptive and can’t be judgmental? I don’t feel like making things up to ratify, if not justify, the action in a given day, especially not when the action is so clearly wrong and nonsensical.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article talks about a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he highlighted several stocks. We selected ten of those companies and analyzed hedge fund investments in each. Finally, we ranked the companies based on hedge fund ownership, from least to most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 20 States that Drink the Least Alcohol per Capita\n\nA hand pouring a cool can of a carbonated non-alcoholic beverage with a smiley face on it.\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 27\n\nJim Cramer commented that Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has been confusing to investors. He noted that while CEO John Fieldly presented a strong case for Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) during an interview, the stock has continued to drop. Cramer doesn’t believe this decline necessarily signals major issues. Additionally, he pointed out that sales haven’t met expectations based on feedback from retailers and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which may explain the downward pressure on Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH).\n\n“Celsius has been a source of tremendous confusion. John Fieldly, the CEO, came on the show and told a terrific story, and yet all it does is go down, down, down. But that doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, although something is difficult to figure out between the relationship with PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) and Rockstar, and I think that may have a lot to do with the decline. But also, the sales have not been as good as we expected, from what we can tell from talking to clubs and, of course, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).”\n\nCelsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is a strong investment option due to its impressive financial performance, growing market presence, and strategic positioning in the energy drink sector. In Q2 2024, Celsius Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ:CELH) reported a 23% increase in revenue to $402 million, driven by a 30% boost in international sales and a 32% rise in gross profit, which now accounts for 52% of revenue. Celsius Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ:CELH) also saw a 29% increase in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and a 55% rise in net income, reflecting its operational efficiency and strong profitability.\n\nDespite facing intense competition, Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) stands out in the energy drink market thanks to its expanding international footprint and innovative product offerings, including new flavors and product lines. Its partnership with PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) further broadens its market reach. Although the stock has a high P/E ratio of 43.49, its strong earnings growth and future sales potential suggest it may still be a good investment.\n\nAlger Small Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional drinks and liquid supplements. It also offers post-workout functional energy drinks and protein bars. During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after the company reported fiscal first quarter revenues below analyst estimates. The revenue shortfall was attributed to ongoing inventory management challenges with PepsiCo, which decelerated year-over-year revenue growth from over 100% to approximately 37%. Despite the near-term growth slowdown, we believe Celsius remains well positioned to potentially capture market share within the large energy and soft drink industry over the long-term.”\n\nOverall CELH ranks 8th on Jim Cramer's list of the stocks to keep an eye on. While we acknowledge the potential of CELH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CELH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Bezos takes on Musk in battle 300 miles above Britain",
        "content": "Musk vs Bezos space\n\nMore than 300 miles above the Earth, two Amazon satellites – little more than pinpricks in the night sky – spiralled downwards towards a fiery death.\n\nThe planned “de-orbiting” of the two spacecraft over the summer marked the end of a lengthy period of experimentation and testing for the online retail giant for its secretive Project Kuiper division.\n\nWith the pilot mission over, Amazon is now ready to begin its space mission in earnest. The $2 trillion (£1.5 trillion) technology business, best known for its online store and Prime service, will next year launch hundreds of small satellites into the sky.\n\nIn total, Amazon plans to send up more than 3,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide internet connectivity to people in remote places, with the first rocket mission pencilled in before the end of the year. Meanwhile, at a 172,000 sq ft factory near Seattle, the company is ramping up activity so that it can produce five $2m connectivity satellites each day.\n\nAfter years of planning, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman, is finally going toe-to-toe with rival Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has already launched a 6,000-satellite strong constellation and is valued at a reported $200bn.\n\nThe two billionaires, long-term space rivals who have traded barbs in public, could also soon by vying for dominance over the skies of Britain.\n\nMusk’s business already has 42,000 customers in the UK, as of December last year. But it is seeking to dramatically expand its service. The Telegraph revealed in April that Musk’s company was looking at a major extension of its UK ground terminals with a view to ultimately launching a satellite service that can connect directly to Britons’ mobile phones.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK’s telecom regulator, Ofcom, disclosed earlier this month it was considering granting a satellite licence to Amazon to bring its service to the UK, subject to a consultation.\n\nMusk has a significant head start over Bezos. Not only does SpaceX have 6,000 satellites in so-called “low-Earth orbit”, 300 miles high, it also plans to launch hundreds more. Musk controls the vast majority of rocket launch capacity in the form of his SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets and has been launching Starlink satellites since 2019. Can Bezos catch up? Elon Musk has been launching his Starlink satellites since 2019 from locations such as the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida - Cristobal Herrera-Ulashkevich/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n“[Amazon] are a long way behind SpaceX,” says Tim Farrar, founder of Silicon Valley consultancy TMF Associates. “It is going to take quite a few years to get this constellation up and running.”\n\nBezos, 60, has long been a space fanatic and is known for his love of the science fiction series Star Trek. He founded his own rocket company, Blue Origin, in 2000, which has the vision of “millions of people living and working in space for the benefit of Earth”. Yet Amazon only began work on Kuiper in 2018, almost two decades later.\n\nStory continues\n\nA rivalry with SpaceX quickly followed. In 2018, Musk sacked seven senior leaders at the company in a row over his typically ambitious deadlines. Several decamped to Amazon.\n\nMusk himself has repeatedly goaded Bezos personally, posting a “silver medal” emoji in 2021 when he overtook the billionaire as the world’s richest man and calling him a “copycat” after news emerged that Amazon was working on a Starlink rival.\n\nMeanwhile, lobbyists for both companies have routinely attacked the other over their developments. Bezos’s Blue Origin sued Nasa in 2021 over its multibillion-dollar deal with SpaceX to take humans back to the Moon, alleging that the $3bn lunar lander contract had been awarded through an unfair process. Blue Origin ultimately lost the lawsuit.\n\nMore recently, Amazon has protested to US regulators about Starlink’s plans to expand its network with thousands more satellites. In response to one recent complaint, one of Musk’s lawyers wrote that Amazon has “filed hundreds of pages against SpaceX, concocting elaborate methods to hamstring SpaceX’s ability to connect Americans”.\n\nDespite its standing start, some industry watchers believe Amazon has the opportunity to challenge Starlink – and certain advantages over Musk’s rival system.\n\nUnlike SpaceX, Amazon also has a cash hoard expected to swell to $100bn this year that it can use to fund its venture. Musk, by contrast, has to keep raising capital or selling Tesla stock. The billionaire also, ultimately, wants to make a large profit from Starlink’s operations. “Starlink only makes sense for SpaceX if it generates cash,” says Chris Quilty, founder of research firm Quilty Space. He is hoping it will help fund his future gambits in space exploration.\n\nFor Amazon, however, a fat profit is less of a concern. There are big potential upsides of owning a global broadband network. It could connect hundreds of millions of people to reliable internet connections for the first time, bringing in subscription revenues and, ultimately, coax them into signing up to Amazon Prime.\n\n“They can justify Kuiper based on its ability to sign up more Prime customers,” Quilty says. “There are a lot of ways Amazon can win.”\n\nAmazon also has a substantial consumer hardware business and supply chain, which has produced tens of millions of Echo smart speakers and other gadgets. These need internet connectivity and expanding its reach could help Amazon sell more devices.\n\nWhen Amazon began developing Kuiper, named for an asteroid belt surrounding Neptune, industry insiders say the company focused heavily on making its consumer terminal – the dishes used to connect its satellites to home broadband – as cheap as possible. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying the first two demonstration satellites for Amazon’s Project Kuiper broadband internet constellation - Paul Hennesy/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nA Kuiper spokesman said its terminal will cost less than $400 to produce. That compares to thousands of dollars for Starlink’s first terminals. Starlink has since said it is no longer losing money on each terminal.\n\nBusinesses, meanwhile, could benefit from using Amazon’s network as a communications backup or get bundled deals with its Amazon Web Services internet infrastructure offering.\n\nIt could also provide Amazon new opportunities for US defence work, with the American military machine keen to diversify beyond its reliance on Musk’s Starlink. “No one wants to be beholden to a single vendor – and not one as mercurial as Elon Musk,” Quilty adds.\n\nBack on planet Earth, the rivalry between Musk and Bezos could soon be hotting up in the UK’s broadband and mobile market. Just a few years ago, using satellites to connect ordinary homes and even smartphones seemed unfeasible. But with thousands of satellites acting as tiny masts in space, it is now being seen as a potential alternative to spending hundreds of millions of pounds digging up miles of road to lay fibre to the most remote areas.\n\nSome in the industry believe this could be more cost-effective than spending money from the Government’s delayed £1bn Shared Rural Network programme on connecting homes on remote islands or miles from any other settlement. Mobile networks have already begun testing terminals from SpaceX and its UK-based rival OneWeb for such a purpose.\n\nThe Telegraph previously revealed that SpaceX has held talks with EE about using its satellite network to boost rural coverage. It has already signed a deal with Virgin Media O2 to provide mobile “backhaul” to remote areas, carrying signals to masts in hard-to-reach locations.\n\nMeanwhile, Bezos’s Kuiper has a deal with Vodafone for a similar coverage boost, extending its 4G and 5G coverage to remote corners of Europe.\n\nNow, Ofcom, the mobile regulator, is consulting on allowing satellite giants like SpaceX greater access to the UK market, including letting them offer direct-to-mobile phone broadband from space.\n\nHowever, Amazon actually has to get its satellites into orbit first. It has already repeatedly delayed its initial mission to the final months of this year. A key difficulty is getting enough launch capacity. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has cut off its Soyuz programme of launches, while Europe’s Ariane rockets are not ready and Blue Origin’s own heavy New Glenn vehicle has yet to conduct a flight.\n\nMusk’s SpaceX is the dominant US rocket company and Bezos has been forced to turn to his rival for help, signing a launch contract in December last year.\n\nThere have been reports that Bezos’s Blue Origin could launch a multibillion-dollar approach for another rocket business, ULA, which is backed by Boeing, but this has yet to materialise.\n\nIn the meantime, the cost of Kuiper is mounting. Amazon originally said it expected to spend at least $10bn on the programme. Analysts now believe that funding will almost be entirely exhausted by launch costs alone. A report from Quilty puts the likely figure at closer to $20bn. A Kuiper spokesman said it did not comment on speculation.\n\nEven if Bezoes gets his satellite constellation into orbit, it remains unclear how well the service will work compared to Musk’s Starlink, which has already won 3m customers.\n\nWith 3,000 satellites against Starlink’s 6,000 Farrar, the space consultant, says: “The big question is how much capacity they are going to have and whether that is enough to take on Starlink.”\n\nHe adds: “The biggest issue is how big is the market opportunity. Starlink has 3m customers. Is there room to grow to 10m or 20m?”\n\nMusk’s SpaceX has already been tested with years of trial and error to get Starlink into the place it is today. In the space industry, there is an old refrain: “Space is hard.” Amazon may be about to learn that first hand.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\n\n“Investors Need a Reason to Buy”\n\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\n\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed’s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street’s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\n\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\n\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\n\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\n\n“Volatility Over the Last Several Weeks is Unwarranted”\n\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed’s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\n\nKrei pressed that despite the “unwarranted” volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\n\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results. Is Amazon.com (AMZN) the Best Blue Chip Stock To Invest In According to Short Sellers?\n\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nIs Amazon.com (AMZN) the Best Blue Chip Stock To Invest In According to Short Sellers?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.77%\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is fourth on our list of the 10 best blue chip stocks according to short sellers. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services.\n\nWe call Amazon the e-commerce giant because it is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. It is also worth noting that its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can also be considered a rising AI star. Over the past few months, the company has not only partnered with AI startups and the US government, but it has also been actively investing in the development of AI chips. Its AI journey does not end here. The tech company has powered its e-commerce platform with AI to help customers shop, and receive intuitive product recommendations, and ideal price packages.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to an 18% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.46 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's fourth-largest company by market cap, but it's the classic case of winners keep on winning. Missed the chance to buy it before it minted millionaires? You can still benefit from owning Amazon stock. Here are three reasons to buy it today.\n\n1. Opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nAmazon's foray into generative AI has created the most hype for Amazon stock over the past two years. However, the reality is more than hype. Customers are using Amazon's AI tools and finding value in them. As Amazon invests in upgrades and new features, it should be able to keep its dominant position in cloud computing and capture greater market share.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) sales growth accelerated to 18.8% year over year in the second quarter. CEO Andy Jassy attributed that to three factors: Clients have finished their cost-optimization efforts that began with high inflation, they're looking for ways to modernize their infrastructures, and they're excited about AI.\n\nHe's said several times that 85% of company infrastructure spend is still off the cloud, but that's going to flip. The flip is starting to happen, and that could send a torrent of business Amazon's way. AWS is the leader in global cloud computing, with a 31% market share. It's preparing itself to stay on top of the competition.\n\nBased on customer feedback, management believes that they're looking for flexibility and options in their cloud spend. It's working to develop a broad base of services that meet any kind of generative AI demand, from the most customizable for developers to plug-and-play options for small businesses.\n\nSince it's Amazon, it also competes in price. So, while it works with Nvidia, it's also developing cheaper chips for customers looking for affordability. Jassy said, \"This team is cooking, but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customers' interface.\"\n\n2. More than AI\n\nAI may represent the greatest growth opportunities for Amazon right now, as well as a new direction. But it's investing in its other businesses and producing results.\n\nAdvertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing segment for a while, and revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter, or by $2 billion. It already offers unmatched exposure to advertisers targeting Amazon customers through sponsored ads on its e-commerce platform, and its new ad-supported Prime streaming tier is adding new opportunities for advertisers and Amazon.\n\nE-commerce continues to show progress, with unit growth outpacing sales growth as consumers trade down in price. They're counting on Amazon to provide a wide range of options and prices with fast and free shipping. Jassy said that same-day or next-day shipping rates are at record levels, breeding more reliance on Amazon for essentials.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt just expanded its Prime program for shoppers at Amazon Fresh, including 10% off certain private-label products, and launched a new no-frills brand called Amazon Saver, with many items selling for under $5.\n\n3. A price you may not see again anytime soon\n\nThe market didn't take kindly to Amazon's guidance coming in slightly below expectations for third-quarter revenue in the second-quarter report; analysts are expecting $157.14 billion, while Amazon gave a midpoint of $156.25.\n\nAmazon stock dropped after the report, reaching its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in a decade. It's already been climbing since then because many investors recognized it as a bargain. At the current price, it trades at 44 times trailing-12-month earnings. That's still quite a deal for Amazon stock, which typically trades at a much higher valuation.\n\nThere are plenty of other reasons to have confidence in Amazon stock, such as tailwinds -- if interest rates are cut next week -- and its expanding healthcare business, and now looks like a great time to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $729,857!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Analysts.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner stocks.\n\nOn one hand, some investors view the status quo as a bear market, and on the other, some analysts hold a bullish view. While caution is necessary, blue chip stocks with historically solid results have an edge in the risk department.\n\nThe Status Quo Calls for Safer Investing\n\nGeopolitical tensions on the one hand and economic turmoil on the other, have created a concerning situation for investors. On September 3, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to share his outlook of the market. Lee is particularly concerned about the job market, the surprise inflation has in store for the economy, and weak growth projections.\n\nLee emphasized that investors must remain cautious for the next eight weeks or so, especially with elections and rate cuts, he predicts that the general public is bound to be nervous and confused. While his timeline may not be exact, he expects economic conditions and political turmoil to settle within the suggested time frame.\n\nHe further added that it is safer to be cautious than to make hasty decisions at the moment. He also stated that the oil industry is particularly weak due to geopolitical tensions despite a massive rise in production. Lee added that increasing production levels does not indicate a booming global economy, because, previously, production increased only because prices were rising which led to more drilling and activity in the sector.\n\nLee recommended that investors will be able to buy long, and therefore it is best to remain cautious. He further added that we already had 7% corrections twice this year, and there is a possibility of another 7% to 10% correction in the market. He did agree that the market is currently testing investors' patience and he predicts something close to a 5% pullback.\n\nHow Must Investors Navigate Moving Forward?\n\nOn September 6, Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss how investors should navigate the market right now. Sonders held a particularly bullish view of the market. She further added that while there has been significant weakness and churn on the surface, it is concealed by cap-weighted index returns.\n\nSonders suggested that the market level declines were most likely a set-up for the broadening out we have witnessed. She shared her point of view on the market, which is rather bullish, and emphasized that stocks in the consumer discretionary, technology, and communication services sectors are doing particularly well. Sonders, however, did point out that the market may see an exhaustion in the mega-cap tech trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe then suggests that investors must let go of the perception that to succeed they must invest in mega-cap tech stocks. She states that there are a myriad of opportunities outside of the mega-cap tech that are high quality. Finally, Sonders believes that a recession is not on the cards and that the current situation is nothing more than a growth scare.\n\nNow that we have assessed the market, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts. You can also take a look at the best defensive stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts we sifted over multiple similar rankings and ETFs to come up with safe and blue chip stocks. The rationale behind this was that investors with little money don't afford to lose a lot and are more likely to invest in stocks that are safer or risk-free. We then sorted our stocks based on their upside potential. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\n\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. In July, the e-commerce giant processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips including Trainium and Inferentia, allowing it to reduce its dependence on other companies.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 26% upside from current levels.

        "title": "Bezos plots GPS rival as Putin menaces satellite systems",
        "content": "Amazon had already planned to launch 3,000 communications satellites under a programme spearheaded by founder Jeff Bezos in 2019 - Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBillionaire Jeff Bezos is plotting to build a rival to the US military’s global positioning system (GPS) amid a dangerous rise in signal jamming since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTech giant Amazon is planning to launch thousands of communications satellites – a $10bn (£7.6bn) programme known as Project Kuiper – that will provide broadband signals to remote areas around the globe.\n\nHowever, the online retail behemoth is now also hiring experts in “global navigation satellite systems” and “position navigation and timing” technology, which are at the root of GPS. Analysts believe it is laying the groundwork to develop an alternative system, which could provide a backup to the military-grade network if it is knocked offline or jammed by hostile powers.\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said it did not comment on speculation.\n\nGPS technology was first conceived by the US military in the 1970s and is made up of around 30 satellites orbiting thousands of miles above the Earth. Today, it is used by billions of smartphone users as well as cars, aircraft and the world’s militaries.\n\nYet there has been a rise in scrambled and “spoofed” GPS signals across the world, with glitches across Poland and the Balkans blamed on Russia’s electronic warfare.\n\nIn March, an RAF plane carrying Grant Shapps, then defence secretary, experienced GPS jamming while flying close to Russian territory. While the incident did not interfere with the safety of the RAF jet, sources said similar events put “unnecessary risk on civilian aircraft”.\n\nCommercial aircraft have little protection against GPS jamming, aside from relying on a pilot’s wits and navigation experience, although it rarely puts flights in danger.\n\nNow, private technology companies are considering developing alternatives. Amazon had already planned to launch 3,000 communications satellites under a programme spearheaded by Mr Bezos in 2019.\n\nBut analysts at Quilty Space identified a job posting that hinted at Amazon’s plans to use these satellites to provide a “GPS alternative” to “diversify revenue”.\n\nThe job listing said the engineer would “support conceptual design” for a position, navigation and timing (PNT) system, while another Amazon executive posted online “advanced PNT solutions are on our roadmap”.\n\nChris McLaughlin, government affairs chief at Airbus-backed Aalto Haps and a former executive at Inmarsat and OneWeb, said rising threats from Russia, China and Iran meant “there is increasing pressure to find resilient ways to secure positioning, navigation and timing”.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has also added to a wave of GPS jamming across the Middle East.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr McLaughlin said: “The aim now is to find new ways to give resilience in GPS-denied areas. Among those ways are to look at low-Earth-orbit satellites. I would be surprised if they [Amazon] are not looking at it.”\n\nAmazon is planning to launch thousands of satellites that will orbit just over 300 miles above the Earth, bringing it into competition with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX operates the Starlink satellite network.\n\nBritain has previously considered developing its own alternative to GPS. It was part of the European Union’s rival Galileo programme prior to Brexit.\n\nOfficials have since then repeatedly considered a sovereign system, although they have not committed to one.\n\nA 2017 report found a mass GPS blackout would cost the UK £1bn per day.",

        "title": "2 of the Safer Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "There is no risk-free investment, and any claim to the contrary is probably a scam. But some businesses look solid enough to still be strong in five, 10, or even 20 years. Companies in this category aren't run of the mill, and they are worth the effort it takes to find them.\n\nFor those who need inspiration, let's consider two excellent candidates: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). These longtime market leaders, both of which are also top dividend stocks, are worth holding on to for good. Read on to find out more.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nA list of businesses whose products millions of people use every day will prominently feature Microsoft. The company is by far the leader in computer operating systems (OS) and one of the biggest players in gaming. Its competitive advantage in both areas should help it remain a leader for a long time.\n\nIts operating system carries high switching costs. Many of its software programs are invaluable to students, professors, and businesses in their day-to-day activities -- think Excel, Teams, Word, and more. Jumping ship to one of its competitors isn't easy. Microsoft also benefits from the network effect in gaming: The more games its devices and consoles have, the more it attracts gamers.\n\nThat said, the biggest growth driver isn't gaming or its OS. That title goes to the company's cloud computing arm, which has gained even more momentum thanks to the recent rise of artificial intelligence (AI), with various AI tools on its Azure cloud platform. In its latest period (the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended June 30), Microsoft's revenue grew by 15% year over year to $64.7 billion. Azure revenue grew almost twice as fast -- at 29%. CEO Satya Nadella said of Azure: \"Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI.\"\n\nIndeed, the company has been closing in on the leader in cloud computing, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), for some time now. Cloud computing represents an important long-term opportunity for Microsoft.\n\nWith an incredibly strong underlying business -- Microsoft has a AAA rating, the highest possible, from Standard & Poor's -- and a competitive edge, the company seems likely to remain successful for many more years. It should also continue rewarding investors with payout hikes. The stock's forward yield of 0.72% might not be impressive, but its dividend has increased by 142% in the past decade. And there is, no doubt, more to come.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola might not seem like an exciting investment in the age of AI and other cutting-edge technology. But a \"boring\" company that sells a vast portfolio of drinks in many different categories worldwide might be precisely what the doctor ordered, at least for those risk-averse, long-term income seekers.\n\nThe company's brands include some of the best known in the business, beyond its namesake drink. With Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, Powerade sports drinks, Gold Peak iced tea -- even alcohol and coffee -- its highly diversified lineup has something for almost everyone. The worldwide popularity of the brand is a potent competitive advantage: It's hard to find a country where at least some of Coke's products aren't sold.\n\nThe result is steady and predictable financial results (the pandemic was an understandable exception). Some of its products have lost popularity due to health-related concerns, but management is getting around that problem through diversification across multiple drink categories and healthier, low-sugar versions. It's the kind of adaptability we should expect from a company that has been in business for more than 100 years and will likely remain so for many more years.\n\nWhat about the dividend? It has one of the most incredible streaks on the market, having increased its payout annually for 62 consecutive years; its forward yield of 2.71% is above the S&P 500's average of 1.32%. It's hard to see that dividend streak ending anytime soon, meaning investors can safely hold Coca-Cola's stock in their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Has Some Way To Go To Become A Multi-Bagger",
        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.14 = US$54b ÷ (US$555b - US$158b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Amazon.com .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 226% in that time. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amazon.com has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\n\nOur Take On Amazon.com's ROCE\n\nThe main thing to remember is that Amazon.com has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 108% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for AMZN on our platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Jeff Bezos’ old neighbor says his broker cheated him out of millions when the Amazon founder bought his $79 million Miami mansion—and legal experts say he has a case",
        "content": "Jeff Bezos’ former neighbor said his broker cheated him out of millions when the Amazon founder bought his house in Miami’s “Billionaire Bunker”—and legal experts say he has a case.\n\nAlthough the $79 million that Bezos paid last year for his neighbor’s Indian Creek Island house was no pittance, it was $6 million below the asking price of his neighbor, Leo Kryss. Having seen the news that Bezos had bought the house next door, Kryss asked agents for his broker Douglas Elliman if Bezos was the one trying to buy his house anonymously, according to a lawsuit filed in the 11th Judicial Circuit in Miami-Dade County.\n\nBezos bought his first house on the exclusive Indian Creek Island in June 2023 for $68 million after announcing that he would move to Miami from his long-time home in Seattle, where Amazon’s HQ is based. He later bought Kryss’ house next door, and earlier this year, the second-richest man bought a third adjacent property for $90 million.\n\nKryss, the cofounder of Brazilian toy and electronics company Tectoy, said he would’ve charged more if Jay Parker, the CEO of Douglas Elliman’s Florida region, hadn’t directly told him that Bezos was not behind the sale and that the “potential buyer,” who Parker assured him was not Bezos, would pay no more than $79 million, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe fact that Douglas Elliman’s CEO of the Florida region called Kryss to tell him directly that it was not Bezos making the $79 million offer gives his case good standing, New York-based corporate lawyer Alton Harmon told Fortune.\n\n“The problem comes when you actually say something along the lines of this is not Bezos, that broker never should have said that, because at that point, there is the possibility for negligent misrepresentation,” Harmon said.\n\nDouglas Elliman declined to comment to Fortune.\n\nAdding another wrinkle to the case, Parker told Kryss that the mayor of Indian Creek, Benny Klepach, had said someone in his family made the offer on Kryss’ house, according to an email attached to the lawsuit. Klepach’s daughter, Celine Klepach, had joined Douglas Elliman as a sales associate just weeks before the sale went through and received a commission for the sale. She no longer works for the broker, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBecause Douglas Elliman was working as a transaction broker, it had no fiduciary duty to Kryss; under Florida law, the broker still had to use “skill, care, and diligence in the transaction,” and disclose any and all facts that materially affect the value of the property and are not readily observable to the buyer.\n\nStory continues\n\nParker had a responsibility to check whether what he was allegedly told by Klepach was correct or not, said Harmon.\n\nAlthough the responsibility to disclose material facts usually applies to things having to do with the property, such as whether there was recent flooding that affected the home, by asking directly about whether Bezos was behind the offer, Harmon said it could be argued that his involvement was material.\n\n“By asking that very, very specific question, 'Is this Jeff Bezos, because I know he bought the property next door?' I do believe it became a material fact that affected the value of the property. So I think that it's a creative way to approach this,” he said.\n\nAnat Alon-Beck, a law professor who teaches corporate law and contracts at Case Western Reserve University, told Fortune that knowing Bezos was behind the sale could have led Kryss to offer the property at a higher price, because the Amazon founder valued it more.\n\n“A price is always what it means to the buyer—how much are you willing to pay for something? But the seller, not having full disclosure on who the buyer is, didn't really get to fully negotiate that,” said Alon-Beck.\n\nKryss is suing Douglas Elliman for damages in excess of $750,000, claiming the broker breached its contractual duties and duties under Florida law. Kryss also wants Douglas Elliman to forfeit the $3.16 million commission it received as part of the deal. Bezos was not named as a defendant in the suit.\n\nWhile Kryss is asking for a jury trial, Douglas Elliman has filed a motion to dismiss the suit. Ultimately, Alon-Beck said that the parties are likely to settle the lawsuit out of court.\n\n“Douglas Elliman failed to fulfill their duties to our client. The facts, as set forth in our complaint, speak for themselves; they knew or should have known who the ultimate beneficial purchaser was and misrepresented that very important fact to our client.  We have no further comments beyond what is set forth in the complaint that we filed on behalf of our client,” Kryss’ lawyer said in a statement.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

This created a barrier for other sellers, the CCI said.\n\n* EXCLUSIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES: Both Amazon and Flipkart had partnerships with smartphone and technology companies to launch their devices exclusively, a move that hurt smaller retailers.\n\n\"Exclusive launches had not only severely affected the ordinary sellers on the platform but also the brick-and-mortar retailers who were provided mobile phones at a much later date,\" the CCI reports said.\n\n* DEEP DISCOUNTING: Both Amazon and Flipkart enabled their affiliated and preferred sellers to provide deep discounts, which involved selling much below cost for the purpose of driving out competition, the CCI reports said.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Samsung, Xiaomi and other smartphone companies colluded with Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart to exclusively launch products on the e-commerce firms' Indian websites in breach of antitrust laws, according to regulatory reports seen by Reuters.\n\nAntitrust investigations conducted by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) have found that Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers, prioritising certain listings, and steeply discounting products, hurting other companies, Reuters reported this week.\n\nThe CCI's 1,027-page report on Amazon also said the Indian units of five companies - Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Realme and OnePlus - were \"involved in the practice of exclusive\" phone launches in \"collusion\" with Amazon and its affiliates, breaking competition law.\n\nIn Flipkart's case, a 1,696-page CCI report said the Indian units of Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, Vivo, Lenovo and Realme conducted similar practices.\n\nThe inclusion of smartphone makers like Samsung and Xiaomi in the case could increase their legal and compliance headaches.\n\n\"Exclusivity in business is anathema. Not only is it against free and fair competition but also against the interest of consumers,\" CCI's additional director general G.V. Siva Prasad wrote in the Amazon and Flipkart reports, in identical findings.\n\nReuters is first to report the smartphone companies have been accused of anticompetitive behavior in the CCI's reports which are dated Aug. 9 and are not public.\n\nXiaomi declined to comment, while the other smartphone makers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon, Flipkart and the CCI did not respond, and have not so far commented on the reports' findings.\n\nBoth the CCI reports said that during investigations Amazon and Flipkart \"deliberately downplayed\" allegations of exclusive launches, but officials found the practice was \"rampant\".\n\nCounterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.\n\nIndia's e-retail market is set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.\n\nThe investigation findings are a major setback for Amazon and Flipkart in a key growth market where they have faced the ire of small retailers for years for hurting their offline businesses.\n\nThe CCI has also said both companies used their foreign investments to provide subsidised rates for services like warehousing and marketing to a select number of sellers.\n\nStory continues\n\nONLINE SALES BOOM\n\nSome of the smartphone companies - Xiaomi, Samsung, OnePlus, Realme and Motorola - have been ordered to submit their financial statements for three fiscal years to 2024, certified by their auditor, to the CCI, according to an internal CCI document dated Aug. 28, also seen by Reuters.\n\nThe investigation into Amazon, Flipkart and their sellers was triggered in 2020 by a complaint from an affiliate of the country's biggest retailer association, the Confederation of All India Traders, which has 80 million members.\n\nThe CCI will in coming weeks review any objections to its findings from Amazon, Flipkart, the retailer association, and the smartphone companies, and could potentially impose fines along with mandating companies to change their business practices, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nIndian retailers have repeatedly accused Amazon and Flipkart, and smartphone companies, of exclusive phone launches online, saying shopkeepers suffered as they didn't get the latest models and customers looked for them on the shopping websites.\n\n\"Exclusive launches had not only severely affected the ordinary sellers on the platform but also the brick-and-mortar retailers who were provided mobile phones at a much later date,\" both CCI reports said, citing analyses of data from smartphone companies.\n\nIndian research firm Datum Intelligence estimates that 50% of phone sales were online last year, up from 14.5% in 2013. Flipkart had a 55% share in online phone sales in 2023, and Amazon 35%.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): This Humanoid Robot Stock Will Ride a $30 Trillion Opportunity According to Morgan Stanley",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks That Will Ride A $30 Trillion Opportunity According To Morgan Stanley.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other humanoid robot stocks.\n\nOver the course of the last century, the makeup of modern day society and the world as we know it has significantly changed. Humans living in the first quarter of the 20th century were just starting to get used to automobiles and long distance air travel was still a distant dream for most people.\n\nNow, with the age of artificial intelligence seemingly upon us, the world has changed. AI, a technology exclusive to science fiction in just the past decade, is now a reality even though its highest firm, i.e. artificial general intelligence, is far from being a reality. Similarly, while factories in the 20th century had to rely on workers for most of their production, now, automation is in full swing.\n\nNo where is the impact of this clearer than in the factories of Elon Musk's car company. The electric vehicle billionaire has often described his attempts at establishing a viable production base for electric vehicles as \"hell,\" and now, he believes that the future of the world lies in the hands of humanoid robots. So much so that Musk believes that by selling $1 trillion of humanoid robots annually, his company can reach an unbelievable market value of $25 trillion. Right now, it's valued at $708.7 billion after having lost 8.96% year to date, and the combined value of the S&P 500 is $45.7 trillion.\n\nMusk aims to have the first version of his firm's Optimus humanoid robot in small scale production early next year and start selling the humanoid robot to other companies in 2026. A simple humanoid isn't what one of the world's richest men is talking about though, since the key to his plan of selling robots is autonomy. This is the key valuation driver, believes Musk, as he shared during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\nAnd it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.\n\nArk Invest, Cathie Wood's hedge fund which filed $11.2 billion of investments with the SEC for Q2 2024, is also quite bullish on humanoid robots. Calling humanoid robots as generalizable robots, Wood's firm believes that they represent a $24 trillion revenue opportunity. This opportunity is split even between household and manufacturing robots, with the investment firm outlining that even a 50% take rate coupled with a 50% productivity boost could lead to a $7.1 trillion revenue opportunity for humanoid robots. Looking ahead, Ark Invest believes that humanoid robots will \"have grown to 10% of the number of humans in the manufacturing workforce\" by 2030 - in an era where cheap \"robots in human form-factors have begun to populate households\" to \"address a third of household chores\" and be an attractive purchase because of the time that they help people save.\n\nStory continues\n\nCathie Wood and Elon Musk aren't the only ones who are convinced about the potential that humanoid robots offer. Another big believer is the investment bank, Morgan Stanley. It believes that the biggest potential of humanoid robots is the cost savings that they can offer. As per analyst Adam Jonas' estimates, these robots can \"bring about cost savings of roughly $500,000 to $1 million per human worker over 20 years.\" These savings will come at a hairline of a fraction of the cost, with the bank's estimates sharing that they could cost anywhere between $10,000 to $30,000 to manufacture.\n\nThe investment bank's estimates also believe that by 2030, America could have as many as 40,000 humanoid robots helping humans. Talking about overall usage, the industrial and other uses of humanoids could lead to a wage impact of $1 billion. These wage impacts grow as we move further down the future, and peak in 2050 when the bank believes that the humanoid population will be at an unbelievable 68 million for a wage impact of a whopping $3 trillion. Of course, the robots that the bank has envisioned aren't your everyday run of the mill equipment.\n\nThese will use artificial intelligence, which naturally expands the investment options for investors looking to profit from this potential growth. As per analyst Ed Stanley, the list of potential contenders for investment as humanoid robot stocks includes \"companies making the generative AI that will power the robots’ brains, the mechanics that make their bodies run, and the battery storage needed to power them. Further development in those three areas will be key to achieving humanoid commercialization..\"\n\nIf you thought that we were done with trillion dollar estimates for the humanoid robot industry, you'd be wrong. Another such estimate comes from the management consulting firm Roland Berger. It believes that if the sector scales according to optimistic projections, then by 2050, 50 million humanoid robots could generate $1.5 trillion in revenue. However, the firm does caution that this optimism is contingent on \"heavily dependent on technological progress and the regulatory environment\" as regulatory scrutiny of humanoids is benign right now as the majority of them are currently prototypes.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used Morgan Stanley’s Humanoid 66 stock list. for our list of the biggest beneficiaries of the humanoid robot race. This list is divided into three categories, humanoid enablers and beneficiaries, enablers, and beneficiaries. From these three, we selected the top stocks from the beneficiaries list. If you're interested in the other two categories, be sure to check out $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q1 2024: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (çç) is the biggest eCommerce company in the world. It operates close to 200 mega fulfillment centers worldwide, which offers it a wide base to benefit from humanoid robots. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also a high technology company courtesy of its semiconductor design and consumer electronics businesses. This means that the firm has an adequate technological base that it can leverage to introduce humanoids in its warehouses. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s use of Kiva mobile robots in its warehouses has cut down click to ship times by 78%, and its partnership with Anthropic also provides it with a large artificial intelligence platform to make up the \"brains\" of humanoid robots as envisaged by Morgan Stanley. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also an early mover in the humanoid space as it started testing these robots in US warehouses in 2023. Since it still relies on eCommerce for most of its revenue, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s stock performance depends on economic conditions. Additionally, it could see additional tailwinds from humanoids through a reported new business division targeting supply chains and logistics.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) believes that using robots will help it cut costs as management shared during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) on Kroker Equity Research’s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMZN. Amazon.com, Inc. share was trading at $187 as of Sept 12th.\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nAmazon remains a dominant force in the online retail and cloud computing sectors, making it a compelling investment case for the long term. With a strong brand presence and a diverse range of offerings, Amazon goes beyond just being a marketplace; it's a powerful conglomerate spanning cloud services, advertising, logistics, and more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is its most profitable segment, holding a leading position in the cloud computing market. AWS enjoys 30%+ margins, allowing it to subsidize other parts of Amazon's business. However, increasing competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is gradually reshaping the competitive landscape. Microsoft, with its deep integration into enterprise environments, and Google's focus on AI, machine learning, and data analytics, are steadily gaining market share, creating a more balanced competitive environment. Despite these challenges, AWS remains a key player, and Amazon’s diverse revenue streams support its resilience.\n\nOne critical area where Amazon falls short is its segment reporting. The company aggregates a vast array of services into broad categories, making it difficult for investors to assess the profitability and risks of its diverse business lines. For example, while the North American segment is more mature and profitable, the International segment still struggles to achieve sustainable profitability. More granular data on Amazon's revenue by product category would provide a clearer picture of its growth drivers and segment profitability.\n\nAmazon Prime is another significant contributor to the company’s success, evolving from a free-shipping program to a comprehensive subscription service with over 200 million global members. The program enhances customer loyalty and drives higher spending among subscribers, contributing to Amazon's overall growth. The growth of Amazon’s Subscription and Advertising Services is notable, both nearing an annual run rate of $100 billion. Meanwhile, physical stores, including Whole Foods Market, remain the smallest and slowest-growing revenue stream.\n\nAmazon is highly focused on cash flow, with its latest earnings report revealing a trailing twelve-month cash flow from operations exceeding $100 billion and free cash flow approaching $50 billion. Despite significant capital investments in logistics and cloud infrastructure, Amazon has reached a scale where free cash flow continues to grow. This financial strength positions Amazon well for future shareholder returns, even though it currently prioritizes growth and strategic investments over dividends and share buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nValuing Amazon is complex due to its diverse and rapidly expanding businesses. Despite these challenges, Amazon's strong financial position and growth potential make it an attractive option for long-term investors. With its forward valuation multiples near their lows over the past three years, Amazon appears to be fairly valued, and its continued growth in free cash flow and earnings per share supports a bullish outlook for the stock.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 308 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the second quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation",
        "content": "Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is up more than 50% over the past year, outpacing rivals in the streaming space, thanks to a mix of originality, strategic alliances and a continuous focus on subscriber acquisition.\n\nThe latest earnings confirm the company is not a spent force. Subscribers are up in the last six quarters in a row, bringing its total count to approximately 278 million by mid-2024. A lower-priced ad-supported tier has helped immensely. Netflix has grown its ad inventory and upgraded its ad solutions to become a major player in digital advertising, leading to renewed interest in the pure-play streaming stock.\n\nAlong with its redesigned advertising approach, the company's move into live-streaming sports events is helping drive shares to levels not seen since late 2021.\n\nHowever, one crucial question remains as the streaming giant expands: Is the stock overpriced? Though the company's strategic choices have spurred amazing expansion, views on the feasibility of this increase differ. What's more, from a valuation perspective, shares are trading at a premium, notwithstanding Netflix's efforts to continue growing. Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation\n\nNetflix rises on strong earnings, continues to outperform Disney and Amazon\n\nNetflix's fiscal second-quarter 2024 results are one of the prime reasons the stock is doing well this year. While experts expected $9.53 billion in sales, the company posted $9.56 billion, a 16.4% increase year over year.\n\nIts net income rose 44% to $2.15 billion from $1.49 billion a year ago. Netflix beat the $4.74 expectation with earnings of $4.88 per share. New subscription options, especially the ad-supported tier, drove the high earnings gain.\n\nWorldwide membership rose by 8.05 million to 277.65 million. The year-over-year increase is 16.50%. Netflix's ad-supported membership grew 34% quarter over quarter.\n\nAmong the major publicly listed streamers, Netflix is the only one to regain highs seen during the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to the push to limit account sharing, its cheaper ad-supported tier and expansionary efforts.\n\nAs a result, Netflix's financials stand head and shoulders above its peers. The streaming giant effectively turns revenue into profit with a gross margin of 43.84%, compared to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 18.22% and Disney's (NYSE:DIS) 35.36%. It has managed costs well in content creation and delivery due to its lean operational structure.\n\nThanks to a basic business model focusing on content production and distribution, which explains its large profit margin, Netflix can invest heavily in its streaming business. This is in stark contrast to Disney, which must balance its capital-intensive theme parks and television networks, or Amazon, which has numerous low-margin companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix's 32.54% return on equity is outstanding financial management compared to Disney's 4.80% and Amazon's 22.08%, which is predictable given Amazon's extensive operations and Disney's need to balance media, entertainment and its parks and resorts, lowering margins and returns.\n\nThe streaming company also has an 18.78% free cash flow margin, above Amazon's 12.60% and Disney's 8.84%. Effective cash flow generation means Netflix can expand into live events, regional content and content development without worrying investors too much.\n\nThe high-wire act of sustaining growth\n\nWith current figures and market performance, Netflix is the top pure-play streaming company accessible globally. Still, the primary concern for investors will be if it can continue growing in the future.\n\nMaintaining that kind of growth will be difficult. Underpenetrated areas, including Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, might be sources of future development. Deals with businesses like Reliance Jio in India and SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM) in South Korea have helped Netflix to establish large user bases in both countries. Another calculated action is aiming to raise its profile all throughout Europe, particularly in France, by means of the Canal Plus and Netflix partnership. By including the streaming service in the Cine Series bundle, Netflix will gain access to Canal Plus' subscribers.\n\nStill, progress in these spheres is a double-edged sword. With 44% of its revenue coming from the North American market, Netflix's future rests especially on this region. Still, this sector is overcrowded as 99% of American households currently have at least one streaming service subscription.\n\nIn the end, regions outside of North America may not provide Netflix the same profitability. Reflecting on the popularity of the ad-sponsored tier, for example, average revenue per user declined 1% in EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific; it rose 7% to $17.17 in the U.S. and Canada in the most recent quarter.\n\nTo remain ahead, Netflix also has to keep investing in content. From $12.6 billion in 2023lower owing to the Hollywood strikesNetflix aims to spend $17 billion on content in 2024. According to data from Nielsen's The Gauge, 40.3% of U.S. TV screen time is streaming as of June. Netflix has 8.40%, but the competition is fierce, particularly from YouTube and Prime Video. Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation\n\nSource: Nielsen's The Gauge June 2024 Report.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix is in the middle of changing its business model, quietly carving out a position for itself in the industry, showing a significant rise in front-of-sale advertising. The company acquired a 150% increase in upfront ad revenue commitments for 2024 compared to 2023. Expanding income from this sector will take time; hence, investors may need to be more receptive to the shift . After Netflix declared it would stop reporting subscriber growth in 2025 and concentrate on operating margin and profitability, its shares fell substantially. Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation\n\nAt the same time, Netflix's transition toward live sports, in the shape of its latest plan to show NFL games and WWE matches, will lead to revenue increases and obstacles. Though intriguing, the company has yet to face logistical and financial challenges in live sports. Live sports broadcasts need abilities that are different from those of on-demand streaming. It must build infrastructure for real-time content delivery, live broadcasts and pricey sports rights agreements.\n\nIts gaming goals are in the same boat. Netflix's first mobile gaming venture has promise, but growing it into a major revenue generator will take time. Sony (NYSE:SONY), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nintendo (NTDOY) dominate the competitive gaming industry. Netflix must create compelling games to compete with these giants while improving the user experience by incorporating gaming into its platform.\n\nNetflix has had some success with mobile games, but it remains to be seen whether it can make gaming a major revenue source in an industry dominated by giants. The company's gaming strategy depends on its ability to provide fresh, engaging content for casual and serious gamers. Spending heavily on game development and acquisition may strain the company's resources and deflect focus from its streaming business.\n\nThough creative, these decisions show the company's growing dependence on non-core sectors to maintain development, indicating its streaming method may have limitations. Netflix risks losing focus and spreading its resources in non-core areas. The company must balance these new ventures with its primary business to maintain growth without losing its status. However, these initiatives will determine if Netflix can expand and justify its high share price.\n\nOvervaluation: The silent risk\n\nNetflix's stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 29.30. In comparison, Disney sells at 17.50 times and Amazon at 30.30 times. These lower values imply the market sees these businesses as less risky or more diverse in income sources. Disney, for instance, has a large range of stable industries outside of streaming, including theme parks and retail. Should it fail to provide the expected expansion rate, the stock price may be significantly corrected. Given the uncertainty in the global economy and the competitive scene, investors should ask themselves if they are ready for the risks connected with such a high value.\n\nUsing a 15% growth rate over 10 years in my discounted cash flow model for Netflix, I reflected its viewpoint on continuous expansion in worldwide markets and new content categories. I estimated a 4% terminal growth rate, a respectable estimate in line with long-term economic projections. Set at 7.50%, the discount rate matched Netflix's current market situation with the natural risks in its competitive industry. With an estimated intrinsic value per share of around $443.02, my model suggests the business could be highly overvalued considering the current market conditions.\n\nFurther, the GuruFocus DCF model also shows Netflix is overpriced. It forecasts a 20% growth rate over 10 years using a higher discount rate of 10%, then a 4% growth rate in the terminal period. Though still less than the market price, the result was a fair value of $550.56 per share. Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation\n\nThough using distinct approaches and presumptions, both models reveal Netflix's stock is currently overpriced, pointing to the possibility that the present market value could not be entirely justified by the underlying financial facts, notwithstanding its great growth potential. Netflix Is Treading the Line Between Innovation and Overvaluation\n\nMuch of the same story persists when you take a look at the average consensus estimates for Netflix. Considering an average 12-month price target of $695.32, the upside is just 2.96%. Based on all this information, value investors will wait for dips before initiating a position in Netflix or adding to their holdings.\n\nConclusion\n\nNetflix has to actively spend on content if it is to keep expanding and compete in new sectors such as gaming and live sports. While its ventures into these new areas deviate from streaming, consistent advancement will depend on balancing core and non-core sectors.\n\nSince the company is extending its economic model, the real test will be whether it can justify its premium valuation or whether the market will adjust its expectations. The value of Netflix will depend on its capacity to develop and innovate. Should it overcome these obstacles, the business might take the front stage in the streaming market. Still, should it fail, a market meltdown might follow.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon To Raise Driver Wages Amid Unionization Pressure and NLRB Ruling\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is ramping up investment in delivery drivers, committing $2 billion to its delivery services program this year.\n\nThis move follows union organizing efforts and will likely raise the average national pay for Amazon drivers to nearly $22 per hour, a 7% increase from last year.\n\nThe investment will also bring other benefits, including technology upgrades for drivers, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon AWS To Invest $11B in UK, Support 14K Jobs Annually\n\nThe pay increase brings the average driver wage up from $20.50 in 2022, with the minimum pay for Amazon drivers now ranging from $19.50 to $25.25 per hour, depending on location.\n\nAmazon does not directly employ drivers but hires local delivery businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, which determine their salaries within Amazon’s guidelines.\n\nAmazon’s increased investment in its delivery drivers follows union activity and regulatory scrutiny of its labor practices.\n\nAmazon is also introducing a new app allowing drivers to access their accrued wages more efficiently, providing more flexibility between paydays.\n\nEarlier in 2024, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Amazon is a “joint employer” of some contracted drivers, which could force Amazon to negotiate with unionizing employees. Earlier in 2023, Amazon spent over $3 million on consultants to deter unionization within its delivery network.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up by 0.67% to $188.26 premarket at the last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAmazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has appointed Carolina Dybeck Happe as its new EVP and COO.\n\nHappe served at GE as SVP and CFO from 2020 until September 2023. Reuters reports that she was pivotal in leading the company’s turnaround and helped complete the spin-off of energy infrastructure unit GE Vernova in April 2024 after she stepped down from her role as CFO.\n\nMicrosoft’s move coincides with its pursuit of the lead in the cloud services market by solidifying its moat against Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlso Read: AMD Taps Former Nvidia Exec to Lead AI Vision, Bolstering Strategic Growth\n\nThe hiring also followed the CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) outage that hampered Microsoft devices, Reuters cites D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.\n\nMicrosoft made another critical hiring earlier this year. In March 2024, the company poached the co-founder of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google DeepMind AI lab co-founder Mustafa Suleyman from Inflection AI to lead Microsoft’s AI division.\n\nMicrosoft gained over 27% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock through iShares Global Tech ETF (NYSE:IXN) and Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT).\n\nMicrosoft Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Microsoft, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line.\n\nFor Microsoft, the 200-day moving average sits at $412.21, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $427.0. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: MSFT stock traded lower by 0.19% at $426.21 premarket at the last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nMicrosoft’s AI PCs Stumble With Game Compatibility: Report\n\nStory continues\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A lawmaker of India's ruling party and a key retailers' group urged the government on Friday to suspend the operations of Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart in light of antitrust breaches.\n\nIndian antitrust investigation reports, which are not public, have found Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers and priority to certain listings, hurting competition, Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday.\n\nPraveen Khandelwal, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, told Reuters he will soon hold discussions with the federal government and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to call for action including \"immediately suspending\" the e-commerce companies' operations in India.\n\n\"The practices of these companies are greatly damaging our manufacturing sector,\" he said.\n\nGoyal's office, Flipkart and Amazon India did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe two companies have previously denied any wrongdoing and said they comply with Indian laws. They have not commented on the Competition Commision of India (CCI) reports.\n\nKhandelwal is also secretary general emeritus of India's powerful Confederation of All India Traders, which represents around 80 million shopkeepers and has for years protested against Amazon's and Flipkart's practices which it says hurts smaller retailers.\n\nThe CCI findings follow a Reuters investigation from 2021 which was based on Amazon internal documents and showed the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers on its platform, some of whom were called \"Special Merchants\", and used them to bypass Indian laws.\n\nTraders and retailers are seen as a key voting bloc for Modi's ruling party, and the investigation findings come ahead of key state elections in the industrial hubs of Maharashtra and Haryana.\n\nLast month, Commerce Minister Goyal publicly called out Amazon by saying the company's investments often cover its losses and the funds were \"not coming in for any great service.\"\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Is Loading Up on Stocks Again; Here Are the 6 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "While election season is keeping politicians occupied along with their regular legislative duties, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, hasn't lost focus on adding to her stock portfolio. The representative from the Peach State steadfastly picked up new positions throughout the past few months, demonstrating interest in everything from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to Vanguard funds.\n\nIn the latest go-round, Greene, increased her AI exposure in a variety of ways, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). While Greene didn't disclose the exact amount that she invested in each of the stocks, her regulatory filing reveals that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nMore of the same magnificent (and other) names\n\nReviewing her stock purchases over the past few months, investors will find that Greene clearly has a penchant for artificial intelligence stocks -- in particular, \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. In fact, in her latest round of buying activity, Greene was building larger positions in stocks she had already purchased. Greene scooped up shares of Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia on Sept. 3, having bought the same stocks on Aug. 21. Greene didn't disclose her motivation for the move, but it's possible that she sensed a buying opportunity. Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia fell 5%, 2%, and 16%, respectively, between Aug. 21 and Sept. 3.\n\nWhile there's no clear explanation for the sell-off in Alphabet stock at that time, it may simply be an extension of the market's skepticism regarding Alphabet's future after it lost an important antitrust case over the summer. With regard to Amazon, investors may have been bearish in reaction to Reuters reporting on Aug. 29 that some Amazon workers would join a Teamsters strike against unfair labor practices that had extended into several states. And investors were likely clicking the sell button on Nvidia stock after the company failed to meet the market's sky-high expectations for its second-quarter 2025 financial results.\n\nApple represents another Magnificent Seven stock that found its way to Greene's buy list again. Previously, Greene had bought the tech superstar's stock in May, and it's possible that she chose to increase her position in September after a slight sell-off following news that Warren Buffett pared the BerkshireHathaway position in Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough it's not a Magnificent Seven stock, CrowdStrike is another repeat-buy stock that Greene had bought previously -- this one in in June. Perhaps sensing another bargain, Greene may have seen value in the cybersecurity specialist, whose stock took a nosedive, after it was found to be largely responsible for causing global internet outages in July.\n\nDriving in a new direction\n\nHitching a ride with an electric vehicle (EV) stalwart for the first time, Greene added shares of Tesla to her portfolio -- a stock that provides even more exposure the burgeoning field of AI. In addition to providing Tesla drivers with the option for autonomous driving capability with its AI-powered full self-driving mode, Tesla has committed to developing humanoid robots that are embedded with AI.\n\nDespite its stock falling in late July and into August, Tesla electrified the hopes of some investors in August when they learned that the company's Cybertruck sales were strong in July -- an auspicious sign for a stock that many had maligned after the company reported second-quarter 2024 financial results.\n\nWhat's a Main Street investor to do?\n\nSmart as it may be to dig into politicians' stock buys and sales, it's never a wise move to blindly follow their actions. Instead, investors should resolve to use the knowledge of politicians' stock moves as starting points for engaging in further research. Nonetheless, Greene's recent stock picks are all worthwhile considerations at the moment, as all six stocks are industry leaders that provide investors with varying types of exposure to AI.\n\nFor those looking to strengthen their holdings with a leader in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike is a worthy consideration even after the July incident. Similarly, with bearish sentiment surrounding Alphabet from its lost antitrust case, now may be a good time to pick up shares for those with long-term investing horizons who don't find near-term volatility daunting. And with regard to Amazon, the company continues to report strong financials thanks to its Amazon Web Services business along with its other offerings, even inspiring billionaires to click the buy button.\n\nApple, Nvidia, and Tesla, on the other hand, are three AI powerhouses that continue to dominate their respective fields and are well worth strong consideration from investors with varying types of investing goals.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Instead",
        "content": "Investors hoping to score returns from artificial intelligence (AI) turned heavily toward Nvidia. Its leadership in the chip industry led the stock to massive gains, and investors who missed out likely remain on the sidelines hoping to buy.\n\nUnfortunately, it appeared priced for perfection, and even a strong earnings report could not stop it from falling.\n\nStill, investors can benefit from AI while gaining additional support from the consumer sector. If you want to enjoy the best that both tech and the consumer sectors offer, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could serve you well.\n\nThe state of Amazon\n\nAlthough investors should consider today's Amazon a conglomerate, most appear to associate it with its massive retail operations. Yet despite an enormous $1.9 trillion market cap, Amazon remains in growth mode.\n\nUnder most circumstances, the law of large numbers would indicate slowing growth due to Amazon's size. However, it has circumvented this issue with an ingenious business model. The most sizable part of its business, online sales, has become a slow-growing business that appears to act as a loss leader.\n\nInstead, Amazon derives most of its operating income from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business. AWS pioneered this industry, which grew to $600 billion as of 2023, according to Grand View Research. Grand View also estimates it will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% through 2030, taking the market's size to $2.3 trillion by that year. AWS also gives Amazon a critical role in supporting AI, making it an essential part of the world's IT infrastructure.\n\nProfit levels are not reported for most of its businesses on the consumer side. Nonetheless, it is likely the positive operating income from its other sectors comes from advertising, third-party seller services, and subscriptions. These enterprises have successfully leveraged the benefits of retailing and IT, resulting in double-digit revenue growth for several quarters.\n\nAmazon by the numbers\n\nMoreover, despite its massive size, Amazon can still grow overall revenue at double-digit levels. In the first two quarters of 2024, it reported $291 billion in revenue, rising 11% compared with the same period in 2023. Of that, AWS made up $51 billion, or 18% of total revenue, compared with $110 billion generated by online stores, its original business.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, AWS continues to make up the majority of operating income, accounting for $19 billion of Amazon's $30 billion in operating income reported for the first half of 2024. After including non-operating expenses and income taxes, Amazon earned $24 billion in net income during the period, compared with just $10 billion in the first half of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon stock continues to climb, rising by just over 25% over the last year. Additionally, between its stock and the rising profits, Amazon's P/E ratio has fallen to a surprisingly low 43, close to a multiyear low.\n\nAdmittedly, the triple-digit net income growth over the last year is likely unsustainable. Still, analysts forecast 31% average annual profit growth over the next five years. Although that is a way-too-early prediction, if earnings growth is close to that level, Amazon's current valuation could make it resemble a faster-growing value stock, making its investment case all the more compelling.\n\nAmazon stock is a buy\n\nIf you're looking for a safe consumer and AI-oriented stock at an affordable price, you may have a hard time clicking on a more fitting stock than Amazon.\n\nIndeed, at a $1.9 trillion market cap, most companies would struggle to achieve high-percentage growth. Yet Amazon has almost defied the law of large numbers by establishing a number of smaller, higher-profit businesses centered around a popular but possibly unprofitable online sales enterprise.\n\nSuch a business model serves investors because it offers the safety of a large, multifaceted enterprise, yet contains smaller businesses that drive significant growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other not-tech AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been desperately searching for a safer way to play the AI boom that has swept the US stock market over the past few months. Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs recently released an investor note detailing which sectors of the economy would benefit from the AI craze, replacing obvious bull cases in the technology domain by thoughtful insights on the long-term impact of AI on utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare. According to analysts at Goldman, AI tools looked set to help companies outside of the technology sector improve productivity and reduce labor costs. The investment titan detailed the insatiable appetite for AI, evidenced by NVIDIA becoming one of the valuable firms in the world over the past year, and noted that the market was yet to reward companies that have downstream AI exposure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in the investor note that the AI boom was likely to play out in four key phases. The first phase, per the analyst, had been focused on NVIDIA, the chipmaker that is at the forefront of AI data center build. Kostin detailed that the second phase was likely to be about companies building AI infrastructure. Some examples of this include semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security industries, as well as utilities. So far this year, the returns of stocks working in these industries have dwarfed the returns of the benchmark indexes. The third phase, continued the analyst, would be about companies able to put AI in their products and boost sales in the process. Kostin cautioned that these firms had lost ground against AI stocks in recent months.\n\nThe analyst claimed that firms falling in the fourth phase of the AI boom, ones who would enjoy productivity gains after adopting AI, had been ignored by the majority of the market so far. Kostin maintained that it was unclear when these downstream AI stocks, some of which are discussed in detail below, would rally and expand their earnings multiples, but stressed that this would happen eventually. The industrial sector highlights the Goldman theory in action. Since the start of 2023, industrial stocks have jumped close to 30% in value. Of these, the firms that are directly exposed to AI verticals have more than doubled in value. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 30% of industrial firms mentioned AI in their earnings reports, up from just 10% in the same period the preceding year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports reveal that Amazon will power the latest updates to Alexa, the virtual assistant it has been marketing for years, with the AI model of Anthropic, a California-based AI startup. The reports indirectly reveal the failure of in-house AI models at Amazon, with some sources that spoke to news agency Reuters claiming that the in-house AI models of Amazon have lag times of six or seven seconds and problems with consistency and accuracy. The ecommerce giant will charge $5 or $10 per month for advanced AI features in Alexa.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. Cantor Fitzgerald recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and $230 price target, citing retail margin expansion and AWS acceleration. The advisory said it saw a runway in both, but added that the magnitude was likely to moderate compared to trends over the past two years and the path was unlikely to be linear.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of not-tech AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "PDD’s Status as Top China Growth Stock in Doubt After 30% Drop",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- PDD Holdings Inc.’s position as China’s top-performing tech stock is in danger, amid a crisis of investor confidence over the e-commerce firm’s worse-than-expected sales and growing competitive threats.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHousing’s Worst Crisis in Decades Reverberates Through 2024 Race How Americans Voted Their Way Into a Housing Crisis For Tenants, AI-Powered Screening Can Be a New Barrier to Housing From Louisville, a Push to Plant Trees for Public Health After a Record Hot Summer, Pressure Grows for A/C Mandates\n\nThe company behind the popular Temu platform and its Chinese equivalent Pinduoduo has seen its US-listed shares slide 30% since results that disappointed the market last month. That’s the worst performance on the Nasdaq 100 Index, and the pain seems far from over as analysts slash expectations for the former market darling.\n\nPDD’s weak outlook and lack of shareholder returns have raised concerns. Meanwhile rivals including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. are showing success in matching the company’s cutthroat pricing, and heated US rhetoric continues to build over the Chinese business model.\n\nIn the earnings briefing, management was “guiding for lower growth and lower margins in the long term,” while also saying they need to spend more to defend market share, said Chelsey Tam, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. “They’re saying competition is intense,” she said.\n\nUntil recently, PDD had been seen as a rare bright spot in China e-commerce, as its low-price strategy enabled Pinduoduo to grab share among consumers looking for value in a weakening economy. It also reaped praise by duplicating that success overseas with Temu. PDD’s shares are still up 171% over the past five years, topping a Bloomberg gauge of the largest Chinese tech stocks.\n\nThat’s changed with the company’s warning that revenue growth will inevitably dwindle. PDD has shed more than $80 billion in market value from a high in May, falling back behind Alibaba as China’s largest e-commerce firm. In the process, PDD founder Colin Huang lost his briefly-held position as the nation’s richest person.\n\n“The market has quickly become concerned that the hyper-growth phase for PDD could be coming to an end,” said James Kenney, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. “The domestic macro headwinds and an increasing competitive landscape are both likely to moderate this strong growth in the shorter term.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc.’s plans for a discount section and recent offerings from others including TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. are crowding PDD’s mainstay low-cost market. At the same time, geopolitical risks are rising as the US trains a spotlight on forced labor and retailers that skirt import duties with high volumes of small shipments.\n\nStory continues\n\n“More than 50% of Temu’s products are currently sourced from China,” so increased scrutiny may hurt PDD’s margins, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Catherine Lim. She added however that “in terms of price competitiveness, I am less concerned on this front as rivals such as AliExpress and Amazon also source a similar portion from China.”\n\nPDD’s consensus stock price target has been slashed 24% since its results in August, more than any other Chinese company except Gaotu Techedu Inc., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts were discouraged by the online retailer’s unclear guidance as well as the absence of plans to buy back shares or pay any dividends, even as rivals plan record levels of shareholder returns.\n\n“All investors we spoke to were puzzled by PDD’s guidance and areas of investment,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Andre Chang wrote in a note. Long-only funds in particular “are disappointed by the company’s apparent neglect of shareholder value, given PDD’s guidance that it will not consider shareholder return actions in the visible future.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nOpenAI is releasing a new artificial intelligence model known internally as “Strawberry” that can perform some human-like reasoning tasks, as it looks to stay at the top of a crowded market of rivals. Oracle Corp. said annual revenue will rise to at least $104 billion in fiscal 2029, an optimistic signal on the growth prospects of the software maker’s cloud infrastructure business. Adobe Inc. shares dropped after the company delivered an outlook that failed to quell investor impatience for new artificial intelligence tools to start generating cash.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single US Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter College Football Players Learn an Ugly Truth About Getting Paid\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon boosts pay for subcontracted delivery drivers amid union pressure",
        "content": "Amazon is giving another pay boost to its subcontracted delivery drivers in the U.S. amid growing union pressure.\n\nDrivers who work with Amazon’s Delivery Service Partners, or DSPs, will earn an average of nearly $22 per hour, a 7% bump from the previous average of $20.50, the company said Thursday.\n\nThe increase in wages is part of a new $2.1 billion investment the online retailer is making in the delivery program. Amazon doesn’t directly employ drivers but relies on thousands of third-party businesses that deliver millions of customer packages every day.\n\nThe company also gave a pay bump to U.S. drivers last year. Last week, it also said it would increase wages for front-line workers in the United Kingdom by 9.8% or more.\n\nAmazon said the DSP program has created 390,000 driving jobs since 2018 and its total investments of $12 billion since then will help with safety programs and provide incentives for participating businesses.\n\nU.S. labor regulators are putting more scrutiny on Amazon’s business model, which has put a layer of separation between the company and the workers who drive its ubiquitous gray-blue vans.\n\nThe Teamsters and other labor groups have argued that Amazon exercises great control over the subcontracted workforce, including by determining their routes, setting delivery targets and monitoring their performances. They say the company should be classified as a joint employer under the eyes of the law, which Amazon has resisted.\n\nHowever, labor regulators are increasingly siding against the company.\n\nLast week, a National Labor Board prosecutor in Atlanta determined Amazon should be held jointly liable for allegedly making threats and other unlawful statements to DSP drivers seeking to unionize in the city. Meanwhile, NLRB prosecutors in Los Angeles determined last month that Amazon was a joint employer of subcontracted drivers who delivered packages for the company in California.\n\nIf a settlement is not reached in those cases, the agency could choose to bring a complaint against Amazon, which would be litigated within the NLRB’s administrative law system. Amazon has the option to appeal a judge’s order to the agency’s board and eventually, to a federal court.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. Since Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that’d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the “iPhone moment” for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the “App Store moment.”\n\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\n\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\n“Annual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.”\n\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Analysts Recommending Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI Stock?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently called AMZN a “top favorite” stock during an interview on CNBC, citing Cloud growth.\n\n“When you think about what’s happening with AWS and the advertising opportunity that they have and that business continues to accelerate growth as workloads move to the Cloud and AI continues to build momentum.”\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The additional $2.1 billion will be spent in the US and Canada in 2025.\n\nThe company’s contract delivery model, which is similar to that used by FedEx Corp., has been criticized by labor groups that claim it helps the company shirk responsibility for drivers. Multiple National Labor Relations Board officials have argued that Amazon is a co-employer of DSP drivers who made claims against the company. The subcontracted delivery companies are also a focus of organizing efforts by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has vowed to unionize Amazon workers.\n\nAmazon has recently been expanding a variant of its contract delivery program that has contract drivers deliver smaller loads of packages in Kia Souls, rather than larger cargo vans.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEV Leases Go as Low as $20 a Month to Help Dealers Clear Their Lots China Can Avoid Japan’s Lost Decades If It Follows Korea’s Path The Covid Pandemic Left an Extra 13 Million Americans Single US Oil Boom Turns Kamala Harris Into an Unlikely Fracking Supporter Putting Olive Oil in a Squeeze Bottle Earned This Startup a Cult Following\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive-India probe finds Amazon, Walmart's Flipkart breached antitrust laws",
        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation has found U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers on their shopping websites, according to confidential reports seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2020 ordered an investigation into Amazon and Flipkart for allegedly promoting certain sellers with which they had business arrangements and giving priority to certain listings.\n\nIn a 1027-page report on Amazon and a separate 1,696-page report on Flipkart, both dated Aug. 9, the CCI investigators said the two companies were found to have created an ecosystem where preferred sellers appeared higher in search results, elbowing out other sellers.\n\n\"Each of the anti-competitive practices alleged ... were investigated and found to be true,\" said both reports, which are not public and are being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\n\"Ordinary sellers remained as mere database entries,\" the two reports said in identical conclusions on both companies.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart, as well as the CCI, did not immediately respond to Reuters queries. They have previously denied wrongdoing and said their practices are in line with Indian laws.\n\nThe two companies will now review the report and file any objections before CCI staff decide on any potential fines.\n\nThe investigation's findings are the latest setback for Amazon and Flipkart in a country where they continue to face criticism for their business practices from smaller retailers, who say their businesses have suffered in recent years due to deep discounts offered online.\n\nThe investigation was triggered by a complaint from Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group of brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart are leading players in India's e-retail market which was estimated to be worth $57-60 billion in 2023, and set to top $160 billion in value by 2028, consultancy firm Bain estimates.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon alleging the company uses \"anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power\". Amazon has said that the FTC lawsuit is wrongheaded and would hurt consumers by leading to higher prices and slower deliveries.\n\nPREFERENTIAL LISTING, DEEP DISCOUNTING\n\nIndian investigators raided certain sellers of Amazon and Flipkart during the probe, following a Reuters investigation in 2021 which was based on Amazon internal documents and showed the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers on its platform, and used them to bypass Indian laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has denied any wrongdoing but the CCI previously told an Indian court the Reuters special report corroborated evidence it had against Amazon.\n\nThe CCI investigation report on Amazon said preferred sellers on the platform \"get the advantage in the (online) listing\" and when a customer searches for any product, \"his attention is drawn towards\" those listings.\n\nThe practice of preferential listings and deep discounting of mobile phones - including selling products below cost price - causes a \"catastrophic impact on the existing competition in the market.\"\n\nIn the report on Flipkart, the CCI said preferred sellers were provided various services such as marketing and delivery at a \"miniscule cost.\" They were also enabled by Flipkart to sell phones with deep discounts which amounts to \"predatory pricing\" and forecloses competition, the CCI said.\n\n\"The anti-competitive practies are not limited to sales of mobile phones. They are equally prevalent in other categories of goods,\" both reports said.\n\nFlipkart and Amazon for months tried to block the investigation through legal challenges in courts, but the Supreme Court in 2021 allowed it to go ahead.\n\nLast month, India's commerce minister publicly called out Amazon by saying the company's investments were often used to cover its business losses.\n\nAmazon in June last year said it will increase its Indian investment to $26 billion by 2030, including for its cloud business. It is also targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Aditi Shah, editing by Deepa Babington)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation has found U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers on their shopping websites, according to confidential reports seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Competition Commission of India (CCI) in 2020 ordered an investigation into Amazon and Flipkart for allegedly promoting certain sellers with which they had business arrangements and giving priority to certain listings.\n\nIn a 1027-page report on Amazon and a separate 1,696-page report on Flipkart, both dated Aug. 9, the CCI investigators said the two companies were found to have created an ecosystem where preferred sellers appeared higher in search results, elbowing out other sellers.\n\n\"Each of the anti-competitive practices alleged ... were investigated and found to be true,\" said both reports, which are not public and are being reported by Reuters for the first time.\n\n\"Ordinary sellers remained as mere database entries,\" the two reports said in identical conclusions on both companies.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart, as well as the CCI, did not immediately respond to Reuters queries. They have previously denied wrongdoing and said their practices are in line with Indian laws.\n\nThe two companies will now review the report and file any objections before CCI staff decide on any potential fines.\n\nThe investigation's findings are the latest setback for Amazon and Flipkart in a country where they continue to face criticism for their business practices from smaller retailers, who say their businesses have suffered in recent years due to deep discounts offered online.\n\nThe investigation was triggered by a complaint from Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group of brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart are leading players in India's e-retail market which was estimated to be worth $57-60 billion in 2023, and set to top $160 billion in value by 2028, consultancy firm Bain estimates.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has sued Amazon alleging the company uses \"anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power\". Amazon has said that the FTC lawsuit is wrongheaded and would hurt consumers by leading to higher prices and slower deliveries.\n\nPREFERENTIAL LISTING, DEEP DISCOUNTING\n\nIndian investigators raided certain sellers of Amazon and Flipkart during the probe, following a Reuters investigation in 2021 which was based on Amazon internal documents and showed the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers on its platform, and used them to bypass Indian laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has denied any wrongdoing but the CCI previously told an Indian court the Reuters special report corroborated evidence it had against Amazon.\n\nThe CCI investigation report on Amazon said preferred sellers on the platform \"get the advantage in the (online) listing\" and when a customer searches for any product, \"his attention is drawn towards\" those listings.\n\nThe practice of preferential listings and deep discounting of mobile phones - including selling products below cost price - causes a \"catastrophic impact on the existing competition in the market.\"\n\nIn the report on Flipkart, the CCI said preferred sellers were provided various services such as marketing and delivery at a \"miniscule cost.\" They were also enabled by Flipkart to sell phones with deep discounts which amounts to \"predatory pricing\" and forecloses competition, the CCI said.\n\n\"The anti-competitive practies are not limited to sales of mobile phones. They are equally prevalent in other categories of goods,\" both reports said.\n\nFlipkart and Amazon for months tried to block the investigation through legal challenges in courts, but the Supreme Court in 2021 allowed it to go ahead.\n\nLast month, India's commerce minister publicly called out Amazon by saying the company's investments were often used to cover its business losses.\n\nAmazon in June last year said it will increase its Indian investment to $26 billion by 2030, including for its cloud business. It is also targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Additional reporting by Aditi Shah, editing by Deepa Babington)",

        "content": "By Nqobile Dludla\n\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com is in South Africa for the long run, its regional marketplace head said on Thursday, after its first foray into Sub-Saharan Africa four months ago.\n\nAfrica's most advanced economy is usually seen as a good entry point for companies to expand into the continent and Amazon could be doing the same, analysts have said.\n\nIts entry comes amid a sharp rise in online shopping in South Africa after the pandemic created an opportunity for e-commerce to finally take hold, with retailers including Naspers-owned e-commerce leader Takealot.com doubling down on investments in response.\n\nUnlike the fanfare arrival that shoppers expected, Amazon launched in May with limited products on its website and little marketing while it worked to bring independent sellers onto its platform. The company has not given details of its plans.\n\nAmazon's Head of Marketplace for Sub-Saharan Africa, Suzelle Abe, hinted at a gradual approach, telling potential sellers at an e-commerce conference in Johannesburg that the retailer would keep building its online store with more categories and sellers.\n\n\"We want to get to know the customers. We want to get to know a lot of important learnings and through that, we keep on building,\" Abe said.\n\n\"And yes, we're definitely here for the long run.\"\n\nThe retailer, which made South Africa its 23rd launch country, recently added jewellery and luggage to its growing list of categories, Abe added, with more to come.\n\nAmazon has two fulfilment centres in South Africa, one in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town, and has partnered with click-and-collect companies such as Pargo and home courier companies for last-mile delivery.\n\nApart from Takealot.com and local retailers, Amazon is also competing with U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc, which owns food and general merchandise group Massmart, and low-price fast-fashion sites Shein and Temu, which have disrupted South Africa's discount fashion market.\n\n(Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This Is the Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Warren Buffett Owns (Hint: It's Not Apple)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days. The best investors on Wall Street have taken notice and are racing to acquire shares of some of the most prominent players in the field.\n\nWarren Buffett might not share the same enthusiasm as many investors and analysts. After being in the investing world for decades, it's hard to impress the Oracle of Omaha. Still, the conglomerate he chairs, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), owns shares in at least a couple of companies that have made key moves in AI, including Buffett's longtime favorite business (apart from his own): Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nHowever, the title of \"best AI stock\" in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio arguably goes to Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nAmazon versus Apple\n\nApple recently announced a suite of AI-related features that will be available to its customers, at least those who own some of its latest devices -- think the iPhone 15 Pro and above. It will also integrate ChatGPT in some of its devices, including its digital assistant, Siri.\n\nThese announcements were a long time coming. Apple was perceived as trailing other tech leaders in the AI race, including Amazon. The e-commerce specialist has been busy. Amazon released such services as Bedrock, which helps companies develop generative AI applications without deep coding knowledge.\n\nAmazon offers a host of AI-related services -- including Bedrock -- through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The list also includes Amazon Q, a GenAI assistant, Transcribe, which converts text to speech, and Translate, which does what its name suggests.\n\nAI is having an impact on AWS' revenue growth. In the second quarter, Amazon's net sales increased by 10% year over year to $148 billion. AWS revenue was up almost 19% year over year to $26.3 billion. Management attributed AWS' strong performance to three factors, one of which was AI.\n\nAndy Jassy, Amazon's CEO, says, \"Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days. But we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers.\"\n\nAmazon isn't done. In a move that could put it in a bit of a competition with the high-flying Nvidia, Amazon is designing its own AI chips. The company believes customers will benefit from customized options that are cheaper than what the runaway market leader Nvidia offers. How will this move impact Amazon's financial results? It's a bit early to say. However, the company's entire body of work in AI is much more advanced and comprehensive than Apple's.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore reasons to buy\n\nAmazon doesn't feature prominently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The conglomerate owned just 10 million shares of Amazon as of the second quarter. That sounds like a lot in a vacuum, but for comparison, it also owned 400 million Apple shares. Still, for investors who want a stock that is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and is a leader in AI, Amazon is a better option than Apple.\n\nAmazon isn't simply an AI play, however. AWS offers many non-AI-related services. It has been Amazon's most profitable segment for years, and there is still plenty of room to grow in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business isn't a particularly high-margin one. However, it benefits from a strong moat due to switching costs and the network effect. It also allows the company to generate billions in advertising. Further, Amazon is a leader in video and music streaming. And, it has long sought to make waves in the healthcare industry.\n\nGiven Amazon's track record and its ability to generate consistent earnings and cash flow, investors should expect the company to successfully uncover more meaningful growth avenues beyond the ones already at its disposal, just as it has in the past.\n\nThere are many more years of market-beating returns ahead for Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\n\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed’s ability to adjust rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. Amazon has pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup over the past few months.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. Cantor Fitzgerald recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and $230 price target, citing retail margin expansion and AWS acceleration. The advisory said it saw a runway in both, but added that the magnitude was likely to moderate compared to trends over the past two years and the path was unlikely to be linear.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "46% of Nvidia's $30 Billion in Q2 Revenue Came From 4 Mystery Customers",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's leading supplier of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers -- hardware that provides the computing power necessary for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The chipmaker can't keep up with the enormous demand for its top GPUs, which is driving a growth surge across its business.\n\nNvidia just reported results for its fiscal 2025 second quarter (which ended July 28), and they topped all expectations with yet another triple-digit percentage increase in revenue led by GPU sales. However, a concerning trend is emerging beneath the surface: Nearly half of the company's Q2 revenue came from just four customers, which appeared to be a big jump from the prior quarter.\n\nThis indicates that Nvidia is increasingly reliant on a handful of the world's largest technology giants to drive its growth, which makes the company vulnerable if sentiment toward AI starts to shift. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's AI chips are the hottest product in Silicon Valley\n\nCloud computing giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) operate numerous centralized data centers filled with servers, leasing computing and storage capacity on those machines to millions of businesses that use it to store data, host websites, develop software, and more.\n\nNow, those data center operators are bolstering their infrastructure with powerful GPUs and renting the computing capacity to AI developers -- a practice Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says can earn cloud providers $5 in instant hosting revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia chips. However, those tech giants are also using their computing capacity to develop their own AI products and services to sell.\n\nTech companies that don't offer cloud services are also investing heavily in AI data centers. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is using them to develop its autonomous self-driving software, and Nvidia says the automotive industry has been a key driver of GPU sales growth for that reason. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is using Nvidia's chips to expand its Llama open-source large language models (LLMs), which will power several new AI features for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark for the AI industry last year, but during Q2, the company started ramping up shipments of its new H200, which can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of its predecessor. However, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will offer even greater performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe new Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, will perform AI inference a whopping 30 times faster than the equivalent H100 system. GB200 GPUs are expected to sell for somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 each, which is similar to the original price of the H100, so they will deliver an incredible improvement in cost efficiency.\n\nThe GB200 will start shipping in high volumes during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (beginning in November), and Nvidia anticipates it will generate billions of dollars in revenue in the period.\n\nCustomer concentration is concerning\n\nNvidia generated $30 billion in revenue during fiscal Q2, which was a 122% increase from the prior-year period, and comfortably above management's forecast of $28 billion. Data center segment sales, which were up by a whopping 154%, accounted for $26.3 billion of that total.\n\nHowever, according to the company's 10-Q filing for the second quarter, four customers that it did not name accounted for 46% of its $30 billion in revenue.\n\nCustomer Proportion Of Nvidia's $30 Billion In Q2 Revenue Customer A 14% Customer B 11% Customer C 11% Customer D 10%\n\nData source: Nvidia.\n\nThe share of concentrated revenue appeared to increase materially from just three months earlier. In its fiscal first quarter, mystery customers A and B together accounted for 24% of total revenue. Nvidia only singles out customers that account for at least 10% of revenue, so it's possible there were other material buyers of its chips in Q1, but they came in shy of the 10% threshold during the period.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to this trend because Customer A, for example, spent $4.2 billion with Nvidia during Q2 alone, and an eye-watering $7.8 billion in the first two quarters of fiscal 2025 overall. There are only a small handful of companies in the world that can sustain that kind of spending on chips and infrastructure.\n\nIn other words, if even two of Nvidia's top customers cut back on their spending, it could lead to a significant drop in its revenue. Nvidia stock has soared by more than 600% since the beginning of 2023, catapulting the company's market capitalization from $360 billion to about $2.6 trillion. Those gains could slowly evaporate if investors become skeptical of Nvidia's ability to generate further sales growth.\n\nWho are Nvidia's mystery customers?\n\nHere's the good news: Nvidia's top four customers are likely some combination of Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Tesla, or even ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and each of them has deep pockets. Based on their public filings, we know most of those companies are spending mind-boggling amounts of money on their data centers.\n\nMicrosoft spent $55.7 billion on capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024 (which ended June 30), most of which went toward data center infrastructure and chips. The company says it plans to spend even more in fiscal 2025. Amazon's capital expenditures during the first half of 2024 alone were $30.5 billion, and it plans to spend even more in the second half to support the growth it's seeing in AI. Meta Platforms expects its capital expenditures to come in somewhere between $37 billion and $40 billion for 2024, and it forecasts \"significant growth\" in that number for 2025 to support its AI projects. Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM was trained on 16,000 H100 GPUs, but the company plans to expand its capacity to 600,000 H100 equivalents by the end of this year. Alphabet spent $25 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of 2024, and it expects to spend roughly the same in the second half. Tesla expects to spend a total of $10 billion on capital expenditures in 2024 as it works to bring a cluster of 50,000 GPUs online to advance the development of its self-driving software.\n\nConsidering that those companies intend to maintain the same infrastructure spending -- or, in the case of Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, increase it -- Nvidia's revenue pipeline looks robust for at least the next year.\n\nHowever, there is competition coming online. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices forecasts substantial growth in its data center GPU sales this year. Additionally, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are designing their own AI chips right now, and while it could take years for them to achieve the same level of performance, their efforts pose a risk to Nvidia's longer-term outlook.\n\nInvestors who own Nvidia stock have no cause for immediate panic, but they should keep a close eye on the company's revenue concentration in upcoming quarters. If it continues to rise, the company could be at a higher risk of experiencing a steep drop-off at some point in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other buzzing stocks.\n\nStock Market Volatility\n\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\n\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500’s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\n\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\n\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed’s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\n\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it’s only 1-2%, then that’s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\n\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\n\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) The Most Buzzing Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nVolume: 28.588M million\n\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 42.624 million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. The e-commerce platform works in 20 countries and ships to over 100. Its global cloud platform operates under the name of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nIt captures over 40% of the e-commerce market in the US. AWS increased its revenue from 18.8% year-over-year in Q2 2024. The overall company revenue in the second quarter was $147.98 billion, representing a 10.12% year-over-year improvement. However, there was a loss per share of $1.26 in this period.\n\nAWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making its performance a crucial factor in future profit forecasts.\n\nOver the past months, the company partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models.\n\nIn July, it processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. It has invested in hardware for long, considering that its non-AI computing chip, Graviton, has been under development for almost a decade. More recent chips by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\n\nIn August, it launched Room Decorator, which allows users to visualize various furniture pieces in their space. Commitment to such advancements is a testament to the company’s long-term growth, making it a top buzzing stock.\n\nIt should benefit from the early-September expected rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Even the slightest reduction in borrowing costs should support the consumer purchasing power.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is held by 308 hedge funds, of which the highest stake is valued at $8,460,561,806 by Fisher Asset Management.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Founded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2023 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence management would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list the most buzzing stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Why is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Hedge Funds’ Top Choice?",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. was founded in 1994 and has become one of the most diversified e-commerce and cloud computing companies in the world. The company's business is categorized into three core segments: online retail, physical stores, and Amazon Web Services.\n\nAmazon's revenue streams include online stores, physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, and AWS. Its online retail platform has everything one could imagine: books, electronics, apparel, appliances, and much more.\n\nOver the years, it has diversified its business to multiple physical stores including Whole Foods Market, Amazon Books, and Amazon Go. AWS, its cloud computing business, provides a wide range of services to various businesses, startups, and even government agencies. Amazon\n\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\n\nAmazon supplies several consumers through its e-retail and physical stores worldwide. AWS generates revenue from a wide range of customers around the world. Amazon's subscription services such as Amazon Prime target consumers who seek convenience and special privileges while using Amazon's services.\n\nWhile all the above business segments make Amazon a successful business, its bullish thesis lies in its ventures in AI. The company recently acquired Anthropic, a direct competitor of OpenAI, for $4 billion. It already offers its Amazon Bedrock platform to users, giving them access to foundation models which they can build their AI applications on. Bedrock users can now access Anthropic, making it an even more attractive proposition. This should attract more users to the company's platform, giving it a larger user base that it can potentially monetize in the future.\n\nAmazon already has a massive headstart in AI since it commands a decent market share in the cloud computing market through Amazon Web Services (AWS). By utilizing the AWS resources, Amazon can leverage Anthropic's capabilities to become a major player in AI, if not the leading player.\n\nThis partnership with Anthropic is still in the early stages and if the partnership takes off, it could result in manifold returns for the company. That $4 billion acquisition price tag will dwarf in comparison to the revenue Amazon can generate with generative AI. This positions Amazon as a leading contender to benefit from AI growth while offering the safety of a stable and strong business, making it a favorite of hedge funds.\n\nAmazon ranks 1st on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 308 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the second quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Forget Apple: Billionaires Are Buying Up This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "With a market cap of over $3.3 trillion, Apple is the world's largest public company.\n\nYet, it's time for investors to forget it. Well, not literally -- just figuratively.\n\nThat's because, while billionaires like Warren Buffett have been selling shares of Apple, several other famous billionaires have been stocking up on a different stock: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nHere's what's happening and what it means for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaires are buying Amazon\n\nEvery three months, large investment managers, hedge funds, and company insiders are required to file 13F forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These forms disclose what stocks are held, thus providing the public with a glimpse behind the curtain to see which stocks prominent billionaires are buying and selling.\n\nLast month, the most recent 13F filings were released, with data from the three months ending on June 30, 2024. And it revealed that several well-known billionaires are adding to their positions in Amazon.\n\nFor example, Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund run by billionaire Ray Dalio, purchased more than 1.6 million shares of Amazon. That more than doubled the fund's total holdings of Amazon to some 2.65 million shares, worth roughly $500 million.\n\nWhat's more, Citadel Advisors, the hedge fund run by billionaire Ken Griffin, increased its holdings of Amazon by around 1.1 million shares. It now controls about 7.7 million shares, valued at almost $1.5 billion.\n\nWhy billionaires are buying Amazon\n\nAll this buying begs the question: \"Why are billionaires racing to buy up shares of Amazon?\"\n\nFirst off, let's remember that 13F disclosures are not a perfect indication of how billionaires really think. For one thing, they're a snapshot. Funds may have already reduced or sold out of stock positions before their 13Fs are even made public.\n\nSecond, funds are only forced to disclose their long positions, not their short positions. Therefore, it's difficult to know a fund manager's true intentions. Are they really bullish on a given stock, or is their big new position just a hedge? There's no way to know for sure.\n\nHowever, assuming that the Amazon positions are bullish bets, what are the reasons for being bullish on Amazon right now?\n\nI can think of more than a few. But let's focus on the company's impressive growth.\n\nDespite already generating well over $500 billion in annual sales, Amazon continues to increase its sales at a breakneck pace. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on June 30, 2024), the company reported revenue growth of 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt that pace, the company may add close to $50 billion to its sales total over the next 12 months. For context, that's the same amount of annual sales generated by Nike, a titan within the sports apparel industry and an iconic American company for more than four decades. In other words, Amazon's revenue is so big and growing so fast, that its growth alone is equivalent to adding a company like Nike -- every year.\n\nIs Amazon still a buy now?\n\nAmazon remains a wonderful company. It has both the world's largest e-commerce business and the largest cloud-services business (Amazon Web Services). Furthermore, it continues to innovate in new and exciting fields, like robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nTo sum up, it can be hard to really understand what billionaires are thinking (despite what their 13F filings reveal). Nevertheless, Amazon stock remains a buy now thanks to its excellent fundamentals and solid prospects for the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $662,392!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

They're rationalizing the technology they purchased over the last four or five years. They're making sure that they're getting real return on investment out of all the solutions,\" McKinnon told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on Tuesday.\n\nAdded McKinnon, \"So it does take longer sometimes to justify what they're investing in, but we're very confident in our ability to do that over time, and that's what we're focused on.\"\n\nOkta's stock was hit hard following its Aug. 28 second quarter earnings release, dropping 18%.\n\nOn the surface, the company delivered strong results for investors.\n\nRevenue grew 16% from the prior year to $646 million, ahead of estimates for $635 million. Adjusted earnings clocked in at $0.72 a share, beating estimates of $0.61. The company achieved profitability on a GAAP basis for the first time.\n\nBut the company displayed a more muted spending backdrop — highlighted by greater challenges in gaining new business — in its guidance.\n\nFor the third quarter, Okta sees adjusted earnings per share in a range of $0.57 to $0.58. Analysts had expected $0.59.\n\n\"Execution is relatively healthy but we're still waiting for recovery,\" JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex said in a client note. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nEssex rates Okta shares at a Neutral, the equivalent of Hold.\n\nMcKinnon said he and his team are very focused on improving growth into year-end and in 2025, mainly through new product releases around AI.\n\n\"Our growth has, like a lot of companies, ... decelerated over the last year or so,\" McKinnon said. \"So we're doubling down on product innovation. We've recently made generally available great products like identity threat protection with Okta AI, identity security, and highly regulated identity.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire David Tepper stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.\n\nDavid Tepper’s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\n“I remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.”\n\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school — 100 shares of a $2 stock, “but then the whole thing went bankrupt,” he said.\n\n“It was a bad investment, but that didn’t deter me.”\n\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn’t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper’s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he’d joined in 1985.\n\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\n\nAccording to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World’s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\n“Going into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short—I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,” he says with a chuckle. “It was very cool.” Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn’t do as well. “I still got a raise but not as much as I should have.”\n\nTepper’s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it’s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire’s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire David Tepper’s Stake: $671,543,750\n\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, recently reshuffled his portfolio after which Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of his three top picks. During a CNBC program, the analyst said that many are still questioning whether major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will get any returns on their AI investments. He thinks, “if you look hard enough” you will see these tech companies have started to get a “little bit of a bang” on the bucks they are spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Amazon, Mahaney likes “AWS growth acceleration.”\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a “fundamental shift” in the industry.\n\n“I know it’s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing. And if your forward revenue estimate is going lower not higher but your CapEx is going up, at some point those two things are going to collide.”\n\nNiles said that major tech companies went through a “digestion” period after seeing huge returns during the COVID-19 pandemic days, and he expects the same to happen as we move into the next year.\n\nThe analyst said that on an equal-weighted basis, the broader market is up when compared with Mag. 7 stocks. He recommended investors to buy the stocks that would benefit from rate cuts. These include consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, etc.\n\nNiles said the other 493 companies could drive the market to new “all-time record highs.”\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI trending stocks that are moving after latest analyst ratings and earnings.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: 'Everybody is counting on us'",
        "content": "The biggest draw at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference this week?\n\nNvidia (NVDA) cofounder Jensen Huang.\n\nInvestors and journalists lined up more than an hour before the session just to catch a glimpse of one of the world's most sought after CEOs. Huang told the audience though generative AI is still in its early days, it’ll expand beyond data centers.\n\n“Now what’s amazing is, so the first trillion dollars of data centers is going to get accelerated and invented this new type of software called generative AI. Generative AI is not just a tool, it’s a skill,\" Huang told Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\n\"For the first time we’re going to create skills that augment people.”\n\nFollowing Nvidia's brutal selloff last week, Huang's keynote was seen as an opportunity to calm investors nerves.\n\n“The infrastructure players, like ourselves, and all the cloud service providers, put the infrastructure in the cloud so that developers can use these machines to train the models and fine tune the models, guardrail the models,” Huang said. “And the return on that is just fantastic.”\n\nAccording to Huang, for every dollar a cloud service provider spend with Nvidia, it translates to $5 worth of rentals.\n\n“I think the days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over,” Huang said. “The idea that every one of our software engineers will essentially have companion digital engineers 24/7 - that’s the future.”\n\nFor example Huang shared that Nvidia has 32,000 employees, who will be supplemented by “hopefully 100x more digital engineers” in the near future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaking on stage with Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference in San Francisco.\n\nNvidia servers \"look expensive, and it could be a couple of million dollars per rack, but it replaces thousands of nodes,\" Huang said. \"The amazing thing is, the cables of connecting old, general purpose computing systems cost more than replacing all of those and densifying into one rack.\"\n\nCompanies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and OpenAI use Nvidia’s GPUs. Despite the tech giant reporting $30 billion in Q2 revenue, its stock fell by more than $200 billion on the same day.\n\nLast week, Nvidia shed another $400 billion in market value following a Bloomberg report that the Department of Justice subpoenaed the company as part of an antitrust investigation. Nvidia denied the report.\n\n“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” the company said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang was not asked about the Bloomberg report on Wednesday. And despite the recent selloff, Nvidia shares are up nearly 150% in the last 12 months.\n\nHuang also said while training AI models is resource intensive, it pays off in the long run.\n\n“One of the takeaways there is AI isn’t just about training the model, of course that’s just the first step,” he said. “It’s about using the model. And so when you use the model you save enormous amounts of time — processing time.”\n\nSolomon ended the conversation asking Huang about his biggest worry. Huang discussed how crucial Nvidia's chips are to its clients.\n\n“We have a lot of people on our shoulders and everybody is counting on us,” Huang said. “Demand is so great that delivery of our components, our technology, infrastructure, and software is really emotional for people. Because it directly affects their revenues, it directly affects their competitiveness.”\n\nHowever, Huang said it’s amazing to watch the AI his company uses to design the chips. “The part of that that is really intense is just the world on our shoulders,” Huang said. “Less sleep is fine. Three solid hours is all we need.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "content": "Time Warp: What Did Jeff Bezos Think About Online Shopping Before The Millennium?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe success story of Jeff Bezos is one of the most inspiring tales worldwide, revolutionizing the world of e-commerce as we know it. What started off as an online bookstore in a garage turned into the world's largest e-commerce platform, valued at over $1.8 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, which ended June 30, Amazon's net sales were $148 billion, underscoring its dominance in global e-commerce.\n\nInterestingly, Bezos had envisioned that \"internet book selling is going to become a very large business\" in 1997, just three years after establishing Amazon. He had expanded Amazon's inventory to 2.5 million books in just two years, which was 10 times larger than inventories carried by the largest physical book superstores back in the day.\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nSkepticism Surrounding The Internet\n\nIn November 1997, the internet was often called the “information superhighway.” However, according to the Money Programme Report by Nils Blythe, internet shopping accounted for less than 1% of total purchases in Britain in 1997.\n\nHowever, Bezos, who appeared in the 1997 programme sponsored by BBC, stated, \"in the first 30 days of being opened, we shipped books to more than 45 different countries.\" Blythe predicted that internet shopping could succeed in niche markets like bookselling, but doubted it could penetrate traditional sectors like food delivery – highlighting underwhelming sales from a small bakery in the UK.\n\nA Gamble That Paid Off\n\nBezos took a huge risk when he left his well-paying job on Wall Street as Vice President of D.E. Shaw, a quant-focused hedge fund, to open an online bookstore, especially at a time when the internet had many naysayers. Even his then-boss, David Shaw, was seemingly concerned about it, advising Bezos to think the plan through.\n\nHowever, Bezos, known for his remarkable work ethic, focused on capitalizing on the booming growth observed in the internet industry during the dot-com era.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, ‘Okay, now I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.’ I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the internet, that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn’t regret that. But I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that would haunt me every day. When I thought about it that way, it was an incredibly easy decision.”\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nBezos' vision has changed to incorporate the changing market dynamics over time. By 2001, just four years after his BBC interview, Amazon had made its first profit.\n\nAfter initial success with an online book-selling business, Bezos ventured to build an \"everything store,\" thereby creating the Amazon that we know today. He didn't stop there – he focused on creating a cloud computing software – Amazon Web Services (AWS). Today, AWS controls over 50% of the cloud infrastructure market.\n\n“Our vision is to be the world’s most consumer-centric company, where customers can come to find anything they want to buy online,” Bezos stated.\n\nBezos' journey comes through sheer hard work and determination, as he pioneered the \"Day 1\" culture at Amazon – claiming it's always Day 1 at the company.\n\nThe Dawn of a Digital Revolution\n\nIt is almost unimaginable to think that just 27 years ago, the concept of online shopping was a matter of debate. The skepticism of the ‘90s has long faded, replaced by a world where a significant portion of shopping is done with just a few clicks.\n\nAccording to a report published by Statista, approximately 43% of U.S. consumers preferred to shop online rather than in-store in early 2023.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "TGT, WMT, or COST: Which Retail Giant Is the Best Investment?",
        "content": "Retail giants like Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Costco (COST) have all performed strongly, particularly since August, thanks to reports of a rebound in U.S. retail sales in July, which suggest robust consumer spending despite ongoing economic challenges. In this article, using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, I’ll detail why Target, which I view as a Buy, may be a better investment choice moving forward compared to Walmart and Costco, where I maintain a Hold stance.\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nStarting with Target, the company’s strong investment case is built around its well-integrated omnichannel fulfillment network. This network allows Target to leverage its physical stores for same-day services, a capability that often surpasses what e-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) can offer. Additionally, Target’s exclusive private label brands enhance customer loyalty and generate higher margins.\n\nTarget’s shares have seen significant volatility, with a 52-week range of $181.86 to $102.93, largely due to external economic uncertainties affecting discretionary spending. However, since early August, Target has rallied sharply, buoyed by Walmart’s unexpectedly strong earnings, which have positively impacted retail stocks overall.\n\nMoreover, Target’s Q2 results provide further reassurance that consumer spending is stabilizing. The company reported a 2% increase in comparable sales for the second quarter, which is at the higher end of its expectations. Store traffic grew by 3% compared to the previous year, with all six core merchandise categories showing growth in traffic.\n\nTGT’s Valuation, Dividends, and Wall Street Consensus\n\nA key point in my bullish thesis on Target is its attractive valuation. The company currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 15.6x, which is approximately 13% below the industry average and 17% below its historical average over the past five years.\n\nFurthermore, Target excels with its appealing dividend yield, currently at 3.1%, which is about 30% above its five-year average. In the second quarter alone, the company paid out $509 million in dividends, and it grew the dividend per share by 1.9% compared to the previous year.\n\nFinally, Wall Street’s consensus reflects overall optimism. Target stock holds a “Moderate Buy” rating, with 17 out of 28 analysts recommending a buy. The average price target of $173.58 indicates an upside potential of 15.27% based on the latest share price.\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nMy bullish investment thesis on Walmart is grounded in its extensive network of physical stores, but it distinguishes itself from Target by focusing on low prices and product variety. This strategy attracts consumers seeking savings and convenience, supported by Walmart’s vast store footprint and its significantly larger global presence.\n\nAs a leading global retailer, Walmart’s performance often reflects retail sector trends. Its share price has surged nearly 50% this year shows success in benefiting from inflation, as consumers sought affordable options have enabled Walmart to gain market share without relying heavily on promotions or discounts. Walmart’s Q2 results exceeded expectations with net sales of $115.34 billion up 4.1% and consolidated operating income of $7.94 billion growing at 8.5%, prompting an increased FY25 outlook.\n\nWMT’s Valuation, Dividends, and Wall Street Consensus\n\nOne major concern for Walmart’s bullish thesis is its high valuation. Since June 2022, Walmart’s stock has surged nearly 100%, resulting in a current forward P/E ratio of 32.2x, which is about 30% above its average over the past five years. Additionally, metrics such as a forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.9x and a forward price-to-cash flow ratio of 19.3x show premiums of over 30% compared to the last half-decade.\n\nAnother issue is its modest dividend yield, which stands at just 1.15%, approximately 30% below the average over the past five years. This weakens the dividend thesis, especially in light of the 10-year Treasury yield of 3.7%.\n\nDespite these concerns, Wall Street remains optimistic about Walmart. The consensus is a “Strong Buy,” with 27 out of 30 analysts recommending a buy. However, due to the high valuations, the average price target of $74.11 suggests a potential downside of 4.91% based on the current share price.\n\nCostco (COST)\n\nCostco stands out in the retail landscape due to its distinct business model, which focuses on low-cost, high-volume sales and relies heavily on membership fees for profitability. This model has established Costco as a reliable growth stock with defensive characteristics over the years and sustains the bullish sentiment on the stock.\n\nSince mid-last year, Costco’s stock has steadily risen, driven by its bulk goods strategy that appeals to cost-conscious consumers during economic stress. In July, sales increased by 7.1% to $19.26 billion, up from $17.99 billion the previous year.\n\nFurthermore, a cornerstone of Costco’s investment thesis is its recurring subscription revenue. In 2023, membership income reached $4.58 billion (assuming full margins), together accounting for more than a half of Costco’s $8.14 billion operating income. Additionally, in the most recent quarter (Q3), Costco’s memberships grew by 7.8% to 74.5 million. In summary, as long as membership fees continue to increase, Costco’s financial performance is expected to remain robust.\n\nCOST’s Valuation, Dividends, and Wall Street Consensus\n\nCostco stands out in retail due to its recurring revenue subscription model, which has driven high valuations in recent years. However, skepticism arises due to the extraordinarily high valuations. The company’s forward P/E ratio is 55.6x, over 200% above the industry average and nearly 43% above its historical average of the past five years. This valuation is based on Costco’s projected annual EPS growth of 13.8%.\n\nDespite Costco’s high valuation, its dividend yield is only around 0.5%, which is insufficient to qualify it as an income stock. This positions Costco as a high-quality growth compounder with a valuation more aligned with growth stocks rather than defensive ones.\n\nHowever, the elevated valuations appear to be justified according to Wall Street consensus. Analysts have given Costco a “Strong Buy” rating, with 18 out of 22 experts recommending the stock. The average COST price target is $936.05, indicating a potential upside of 4.65% based on the current share price.\n\nConclusion: TGT Is My Best Pick\n\nRetail giants like Target, Walmart, and Costco have recently reported that consumer spending has turning into normal and is not as weak as expected. While each of these companies is well-positioned within its business model, I see more value in taking a bullish stance on Target due to its attractive valuation and dividend yield. In contrast, I maintain a neutral stance on Walmart and Costco due to their valuations being incredibly stretched.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "There are roughly four dozen stocks in the massive portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), and to be fair, there's a solid investment case to be made for most of them. However, one of Berkshire's bank stocks and one of its megacap tech holdings look especially attractive at their current prices. Which of these two stocks owned by the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate is the better fit for you?\n\nA highly profitable bank with a bright future\n\nCapital One Financial(NYSE: COF) is one of Berkshire's smaller bank stock holdings, with a stake of 2.6% of the bank worth \"only\" $1.6 billion. But for long-term investors, Capital One looks like a tremendous value and has some interesting growth opportunities in the future.\n\nCapital One is best known for its credit card business, and for good reason. Credit cards make up more than half of Capital One's total-loan portfolio, and because of the high-interest nature of the credit card industry, this allows Capital One to produce a 6.7% net-interest margin, more than double what most other large U.S. banks typically report. There is plenty of cash in reserves to cover expected losses, and while Capital One's net charge-off rate has increased significantly over the past year, it has stabilized over the past couple of quarters and is at a reasonable level.\n\nThere are two other big reasons why I'm bullish on Capital One. First, lower interest rates could be a major catalyst, as they would significantly reduce Capital One's deposit costs. Capital One is one of the few branch-based banks that offers online-like interest rates on deposit accounts, so this could be a big tailwind.\n\nThere's also the pending acquisition of Discover Financial Services(NYSE: DFS), which would not only dramatically increase the size of Capital One's credit card business but would give Capital One its own payment network, creating all sorts of interesting long-term possibilities.\n\nAfter a recent pullback, Capital One trades for about 12% below its recent high and for more than 10% below its book value. To be fair, there are some legitimate risks involved with such a credit card-heavy banking business. But the risk-reward dynamics look very attractive right now, especially if the bank can successfully complete the Discover merger.\n\nStrong growth and an attractive price\n\nAmazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs despite strong growth momentum and improving profitability throughout its business.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Amazon reported net-sales growth of 11% year over year. But due to CEO Andy Jassy's focus on efficiency, operating income soared by a staggering 91%. Net income doubled year over year, and there was a big improvement in all three of Amazon's business segments (U.S. sales, international sales, and Amazon Web Services, or AWS).\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking that Amazon doesn't still have tons of room to grow. The industry-leading AWS business should have a long-tailed growth opportunity, as the cloud-computing industry is expected to more than triple in size by 2032. In fact, with 19% year-over-year sales growth, it is the fastest-growing part of Amazon's business, and it is also far more profitable than the e-commerce side.\n\nInternational growth is another big potential growth area, as Amazon.com doesn't have nearly the dominant presence it has in the U.S. in many of its key international markets.\n\nWhich Buffett stock is right for you?\n\nBoth stocks look attractive at their current valuations, and both have exciting long-term growth opportunities.

The latest announcement will bring AWS’s total planned investment in the country to over 11 billion pounds.\n\nAWS reported 19% topline growth in the second quarter, reaching $26.3 billion. Amazon’s capital spending reached $17.62 billion in the second quarter, up 50% as it ramped up spending on data centers, real estate, and chips to accomplish its AI ambitions, similar to those of its Big Tech counterparts.\n\nSince 2024, AWS has committed over $50 billion in overseas investments. It committed 7.8 billion euros to the AWS European Sovereign Cloud in Germany through 2040, which has the potential to sustain 2,800 full-time equivalent jobs annually in local German businesses. AWS earmarked $6.2 billion in Malaysia through 2038, which could support over 3,500 jobs annually.\n\nJMP Securities analyst Nicholas Jones projected AWS’s upside, especially flagging the absence of capacity constraints in Microsoft Corp’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure business.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up 0.45% to $180.36 premarket at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon AWS To Invest $11B in UK, Support 14K Jobs Annually originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "There are at least two ways to make a million dollars in investing. One method is to stumble on a future blockbuster idea long before it catches on, and the other is to make steady investments in stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with decades of wealth-building staying power.\n\nThe first millionaire-maker method involves more luck than planning. Investing authority Benjamin Graham would call this approach \"gambling,\" not \"investing.\"\n\nThe second approach is much more reliable. Build a diversified portfolio full of robust companies with long-term business plans, and watch your net worth grow for decades. If you really want to make a million on Wall Street, this is a sensible plan. Invest $5,000 a year, settling for an average annual return of 8%, and you'll have a million-dollar portfolio after 36 years.\n\nSo I'm not here to show you the hottest growth stock of the next decade. Instead, I'll suggest two tech stocks that look ready to deliver solid gains for many years to come. And I wouldn't be surprised to see them beat the market along the way, accelerating your journey to the $1,000,000 mark, but I'm doubling down on unbreakable staying power in this quick review.\n\nAmazon\n\nWhat started as an online bookstore has grown into a global behemoth of e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) is building a business empire for the ages, bit by surprising bit.\n\nIt started with founder Jeff Bezos' insight that an online marketplace without physical stores can save tons of operating costs compared to traditional book stores. Passing on those savings to customers in the form of low book prices led to explosive growth, eventually expanding into all sorts of online shopping categories.\n\nE-commerce is still the backbone of Amazon's operations today. In the recently reported second quarter of 2024, the company collected 82% of its revenues from online retail sales.\n\nAt the same time, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing platform accounted for 64% of Amazon's operating profit. AWS started life as an experimental way to make some money from Amazon's massive network of computing assets, which sometimes sat unused in their data centers. Now, it's an incredibly lucrative service and also Amazon's gateway into the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nThe company is also building an unmatched shipping network, developing a satellite-based broadband service to provide internet access for emerging countries, while winning Emmies and Oscars for the Prime Video platform's original content. I'm just scratching the surface of Amazon's business expansion efforts here, and that's before even mentioning the opportunity for international growth in the e-commerce division.\n\nStory continues\n\nA couple of decades ago, I might have said that \"this little Internet retailer is going places.\" Now, it's one of the largest companies in the world with an $1.8 trillion market cap and $604 billion in trailing twelve-month sales -- and Amazon is still going places.\n\nThis flourishing e-commerce and technology titan is not running short on growth ideas. This is the stuff that long-term returns are made of.\n\nIBM\n\nIt's not the same old International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) that your parents and great-great-grandparents knew, building data centers in the 1990s and electronic multipliers in the 1940s. And Big Blue's stock has underperformed the market over the last decade due to a long and painful strategy shift.\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/charts/fund_chart_creator/fool/#/?annualizedReturns=false&calcs=id:total_return_forward_adjusted_price,include:true,,&chartId=&chartType=&correlations=&customGrowthAmount=&dateSelection=range&displayDateRange=&endDate=&format=indexed&legendOnChart=true&lineAnnotations=&nameInLegend=name&note=&partner=fool_720&quoteLegend=false&recessions=false&scaleType=linear&securities=id:IBM,include:true,type:security,,id:%5ESPX,include:true,type:security&securityGroup=&securitylistName=&securitylistSecurityId=&source=false&splitType=metric&startDate=&title=&units=false&useCustomColors=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=10&dataInLegend=value&hideValueFlags=false\n\nBut that business plan revamp was exactly the right idea, as it positioned IBM for decades of growth and leadership in AI expertise and consulting services. The company is starting to prove the financial worth of its new plan right about now, and I can't wait to see how its AI-based revenues and profits will rise in the next few years.\n\nAnd then I'll be thrilled to see the company take another sharp turn into whatever long-term idea comes next. Maybe IBM will lean into the quantum computing realm, where it is already setting the standards without writing too many headlines. Or perhaps I haven't even heard of whatever next-generation business driver this innovator is working on behind closed doors.\n\nAnd it doesn't really matter. The important part is IBM's open attitude to market change. You can't stop it -- you can only hope to control it. That's why it started focusing on the Watson-branded AI systems many years before OpenAI opened the AI floodgates with its ChatGPT release. IBM was built to roll with the punches and thrive in the long haul. Its business already has more than a century of operating history, and I full expect it to be a relevant tech titan in the 22nd century, too.\n\nAmazon and IBM can't compete with the instant diversification you get from an index fund, but they may be the next best thing. With these tech giants in your pocket, you'll be ready to ride out whatever market shifts and economic trends might emerge over the next few decades. Their staying power will help you build that a million-dollar portfolio in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar: 2 Growth Stocks With 26% and 38% Upside to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) closed in correction territory on Aug. 2, meaning it had fallen at least 10% from its bull market high. Worrisome labor market data factored heavily into the drawdown. The U.S. added fewer jobs than analysts anticipated in July, and unemployment reached its highest level since 2021.\n\nHowever, investors have good reason to be optimistic. The index tends to bounce back quickly. During the last 15 years, the Nasdaq has returned an average of 21.9% during the 12 months following its first close in correction territory. The implied upside is approximately 22% by August 2025 because the index has traded sideways since entering a correction last month.\n\nOf course, past performance never guarantees future results. But Wall Street analysts forecast sizable gains for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS).\n\nAmazon has a median 12-month price target of $220 per share, implying 26% upside from its current share price of $174. Zscaler has a median 12-month price target of $220 per share, implying 38% upside from its current share price of $159.\n\nHere's what investors should about these Nasdaq stocks.\n\nAmazon: Wall Street forecasts 26% upside\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is gaining share across all three markets. In e-commerce, Amazon will account for 40.4% of online retail sales in the U.S. this year, up 80 basis points from last year, according to eMarketer.\n\nIn digital advertising, Amazon will account for 13.9% of digital ad spending in the U.S. this year, up 140 basis points from last year, according to eMarketer. And in cloud computing, Amazon Web Services accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services spending in the second quarter, up 100 basis points from the previous quarter, according to Synergy Research Group.\n\nAmazon reported decent financial results in the second quarter, though the company narrowly missed top-line estimates. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, but Wall Street expected revenue to grow half a percentage point faster. However, GAAP earnings still increased 94% to $1.26 per dilute share, easily topping the 58% growth analysts anticipated.\n\nMissing second-quarter revenue estimates alone may not have caused a problem, but management also forecasted slower growth in the third quarter. Specifically, the midpoint of guidance implies 9% revenue growth, which is slightly below the 11% growth analysts anticipated. The stock fell sharply on the news and it has yet to rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut investors are missing the big picture. Amazon is gaining market share across its core businesses, and Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings at 23% annually over the next three years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 42 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.8, which is well below the three-year average of 2.9. In that context, investors should feel confident buying a small position in this growth stock today.\n\nZscaler: Wall Street analysts forecast 38% upside\n\nZscaler is a cybersecurity company that specializes in zero trust network access. Its security service edge (SSE) platform solves three major problems inherent to traditional perimeter-based solutions. First, it provides a better user experience because web traffic is inspected in the cloud rather than private data centers, which prevents bottleneck-based performance issues.\n\nSecond, it frees businesses from the burden of buying expensive on-premises security appliances. Third, it improves threat detection because Zscaler has more data than non-security companies. It uses that information to train artificial intelligence models, creating a network effect whereby every data point enhances its ability to detect and stop attacks.\n\nCEO Jay Chaudhry recently highlighted that advantage. \"We are training our AI security models with vast amounts of data generated by over 400 billion daily transactions on our platform to deliver superior threat detection. We are leveraging AI to automatically classify data and enforce policies for better data loss prevention.\"\n\nZscaler reported better-than-expected financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended July 31). Revenue increased 30% to $593 million and non-GAAP net income jumped 38% to $0.88 per diluted share. CEO Jay Chaudhry said the company set a record for new and upsell business during the quarter, driven in part by emerging products for AI analytics and digital experience monitoring.\n\nHowever, management provided disappointing guidance that caused the stock to fall over 17% following the report. Revenue growth is projected to decelerate to 20% in fiscal 2025. But that reflects temporary headwinds arising from higher-than-expected turnover in the sales organization last quarter. Hiring and training sales reps will take time, according to CFO Remo Canessa. But the company's go-to-market capabilities should improve toward the second half of they year.\n\nMeanwhile, the drawdown creates a buying opportunity for patient investors. Wall Street expects Zscaler's revenue to grow at 21% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 10.9 times sales look reasonable. In fact, Zscaler shares haven't been that cheap in 15 months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Disney investors are glued to CEO succession outcome: Goldman Sachs analyst",
        "content": "Who lands the Disney (DIS) CEO gig after Bob Iger remains a hot button issue with institutional investors.\n\n\"When I talk to investors, succession planning is incredibly important because it dictates the strategy of the company. And I think over the last few years prior to Mr. Iger coming back into his current role, we've seen a few missteps perhaps on the film and TV studio side in particular, where there has been some market share loss,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Tuesday.\n\nNg rates Disney's stock at a Buy rating.\n\nAdded Ng, \"One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep, deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios and obviously at ESPN.\"\n\nThere are reportedly four internal candidates being considered for the coveted position, which Iger held from 2005 to 2020 before returning in November 2022: entertainment division co-chiefs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, parks division head Josh D'Amaro, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro. Walden is seen as having a slight edge, but it's far from certain.\n\nThe company could also choose to go with an outside candidate.\n\n\"I think we may know this year, but [Bob Iger] has two and a half more years. So it wouldn't surprise me if it is extended a little bit beyond this calendar year into next calendar year,\" close adviser and Candle Media co-founder Kevin Mayer told Yahoo Finance at the Cannes Lions Festival in mid-June.\n\nThe CEO search is set against a backdrop of more challenging operating conditions for Disney.\n\nDisney (DIS) reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings in early August, but called out a late quarter slowdown in its theme park business. The company thinks the slowdown will persist for the next few quarters.\n\n\"We certainly see consumers behaving in a way — I wouldn't call it recessionary necessarily — they're watching their pennies a little bit more,\" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston told me on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief.\n\nSales in its experiences segment — which houses the global theme park business — rose 2% year over year. Operating income fell 3%. Attendance was relatively unchanged year over year.\n\nFor the current quarter, Disney forecasts that operating profit for the segment will fall by a mid-single-digit percentage.\n\nShares of Disney are down about 14% in the last three months.\n\nDespite the stock slide, Ng is staying upbeat with several longer-term positives for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There's going to be a short list of media companies that can have large scaled streaming video businesses. I think Disney probably sits there among a few other companies, namely Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) Prime,\" Ng said.\n\n\"One other thing that I think puts Disney in a very good position over the long-term is its marquee sports rights portfolio, many of which are locked up through the end of the decade.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "Amazon Web Services' competitive advantage in AI is its competitors",
        "content": "Amazon Web Services (AMZN) isn't putting all its chips on one AI model. Instead, it aims to win by keeping friends close and potential rivals closer.\n\nWhile other hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) compete on large language models, AWS hopes to offer customers whatever models they want. The cloud giant is positioning itself not just as an artificial intelligence platform to train models but as a marketplace to sell them.\n\n\"There's not going to be one model that's going rule them all,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"The best model today may not be the best model tomorrow. … If you have a platform that has a bunch of models available, it's actually relatively easy to take advantage of new ones or add new capabilities from other providers as they come along.\" An Amazon Web Services logo is pictured during a trade fair in Hannover Messe, in Hanover, Germany, April 22, 2024. (REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned this strategy on Amazon’s latest earnings call. Jassy noted that Amazon's Bedrock service has the \"broadest selection of LLMs\" and offers a variety of leading foundational models to AWS customers, who can then build their own AI applications using Anthropic’s Claude 3 models, Meta’s Llama 3 models, and Amazon's Titan models.\n\nThe latest example of this strategy emerged on Monday when AWS and Oracle announced a partnership despite 15 years of competition between the two cloud providers.\n\nCooperation, not direct competition, is how AWS plans to diversify its revenue streams and monetize AI. AWS is projecting $105 billion in revenue this year — about 17% of Amazon’s total revenue, according to estimates.\n\nAWS not 'rushing in' to chatbots\n\nWhen asked about the perception that Amazon is falling behind on AI — particularly when compared to Microsoft — Garman was quick to mention that for Microsoft, \"it’s not their own technology. … OpenAI was listed as a competitor of theirs, which is an interesting dynamic for them. ... We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\n\nIn other words, AWS’s perceived sluggishness in AI adoption is a strategic feature, not a bug.\n\n\"We felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology that ... looks cool and allows people to write haikus,\" Garman said. \"That's not really the eventual place that the value is going to come from this technology.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat focus on AI infrastructure has helped buoy the stock amid a tech pullback. Year to date, Amazon stock has gained 18%, outperforming the Nasdaq index and other hyperscalers, such as Microsoft and Google.\n\nAnd AWS is not just offering multiple LLMs to customers — the company is also offering chips from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), as well as their own.\n\n“If you talk to customers out there, still, the large majority of usage is on Nvidia chips,\" Garman said. \"They have a great platform … and they're very popular with customers.”\n\nThat popularity explains why AWS has yet to talk about competing directly with Nvidia on chips. While Garman would not share details about the usage ratio of Nvidia's chips to AWS's on internal workloads, he agreed it would be beneficial to rely more fully on their in-house chips over time to protect margins.\n\n“I don't know that we'll ever be fully reliant on [in-house chips] because I think that the Nvidia team builds some great processors and some great products, and they execute really well.”\n\nIn his remarks at the conference, Garman walked a fine line between promoting AWS chips while reminding the audience that AWS offers Nvidia GPUs as well, again promoting the idea of customer choice as AWS's key differentiator.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the Goldman conference on Wednesday morning. Garman quipped that he would have plenty to say about Nvidia's partnership with AWS.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Dunn characterized the government's claims as gerrymandered in order to eliminate the existence of substitute online advertising services that could broaden the market.\n\n\"I think it's a clever play by Google,\" McCuaig said. \"I don't think it ultimately carries the day.\"\n\nMcCuaig said Google may have relied too strongly on a Supreme Court case involving American Express, in which the high court ruled that credit card networks were one market with two sides.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n'No such thing' as open web display ad tools\n\nAccording to the DOJ, businesses that offer technology to automate sale and purchase of ads on the open web, or \"open web display ads,\" operate in distinct markets. The technologies are responsible for processing more than $24 billion in online ad sales each year.\n\nProsecutors claim that Google illegally monopolized three markets for open web display ads: the publishing ad server market, the ad exchange market, and the advertiser ad network market.\n\nTogether, the technologies make it possible for website owners to organize and offer display ad space on their web and mobile pages. For advertisers, they help evaluate those advertising opportunities. Exchanges then process auctions for the ad, in real time, most of which is automated using algorithms.\n\nThere is \"no such thing\" as a \"tool for open web display ads,\" Google lawyer Dunn told US District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, who will decide the case.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, Dunn argued, ad tech tools are just part of a larger online advertising market that, in addition to algorithm-driven or \"programatic\" auctions, also includes digital ad deals negotiated human-to-human.\n\nA single, two-sided market\n\nThat larger market, Google said, is a single, two-sided, rapidly changing one in which Google competes with other tech giants, including Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, TikTok, Roku, Disney, and Yahoo Finance's parent company Yahoo.\n\nOn top of that, Google said it also competes with ad tech companies that deal more exclusively in the businesses of supplying ad tech for publishers, advertisers, or exchange platforms.\n\nHowever, on Monday, the government's first four witnesses suggested that separate ad tech markets do, in fact, exist.\n\nJames Avery, founder and CEO of the ad tech company Kevel, testified that his company serves only the publisher side of the industry by building proprietary ad technologies for publishers. One goal of that type of technology, he said, is to make website owners less reliant on third-party ad tech, like Google's publisher server DoubleClick for Publishers.\n\nAvery said his company stopped trying to compete with Google around 2012, once he realized that he couldn't overcome the tech giant's rules that walled off rival publisher servers from accessing Google's real-time inventory on Google's exchange, AdX.\n\nAvery added that his publisher-side technology does not preference exchanges unless a customer chooses to do so.\n\n\"We have no horse in that race,\" Avery said, distinguishing Kevel's market from other parts of the ad tech stack.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnother witness, Joshua Lowcock, president of the advertising data firm Quad (QUAD), testified that open web display ads, or \"programmatic\" display ads, are unique because they can be placed anywhere on the internet.\n\nThose ads are different from ads run on platforms such as Facebook (META), TikTok, or Amazon (AMZN), which run their own auctions on proprietary \"walled garden\" ad tech software.\n\n\"Direct\" transactions, otherwise known as human-to-human transactions, are another market still, Lowcock said, in that they are negotiated between real people.\n\n\"They are not substitutes,\" Lowcock said about the different ad platforms.\n\nLowcock admitted on cross-examination that his firm had suggested that a client replace ad spending on programmatic ads with ads bought through social media platforms, which tend to own their own ad auctions.

(AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhether a consumer would substitute one product for another is integral to how Judge Brinkema will evaluate the DOJ's suggested markets.\n\nIn theory, if a substitute exists, the market should be defined broadly enough to include it.\n\nAndrew Casale, founder and CEO of ad exchange Index Exchange, testified for the government that exchanges are yet another part of the ad tech ecosystem, along with walled garden ad tech software that does not integrate with third-party exchanges.\n\n\"I view these as separate businesses,\" Casale said. \"We only compete in one business.\"\n\nOne antitrust expert who talked with Yahoo Finance doesn't buy what the Feds are selling.\n\nAlden Abbott, a Mercatus Center research fellow and former general counsel for the US Federal Trade Commission, said that despite the DOJ's claims, he views Microsoft, TikTok, Yahoo, and others as Google's online advertising competitors.\n\n\"I don't see how this is an antitrust problem,\" Abbott said. \"Where are the barriers to entry?\"\n\nAbbott and McCuaig said antitrust cases ultimately depend on the welfare of consumers, and the DOJ's case fails if it cannot prove that consumers are harmed by Google.\n\nOne obstacle to proving consumer harm, they said, is that the publisher- and advertiser-side technologies have no independent consumer demand absent their counterparts.\n\n\"Where is a harm to consumer welfare?\" Abbott asked. \"Antitrust, in my mind, is not supposed to design a market,\" Abbott said. \"That's not a role that governments should play.\"\n\nIt's uncertain how long the trial will last. Google's case over the DOJ's search monopoly claims lasted 10 weeks. Google will have a chance to call its own witnesses once the government rests its case.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Short Seller Sentiment For This Big-Name Stock is Bullish",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big-Name Stocks to Buy Right Now According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big name stocks.\n\nIn early April 2024, Goldman Sachs Inc.’s data revealed that short selling on individual US-listed stocks was at the highest level in 6 months, and the most targeted sectors were technology, telecom, and media. This increase in short positions was seen after the significant ~9% advance seen in 1Q 2024 for the S&P 500. As per the data, some hedge funds that were using long-short equity strategies have started to fight the rally.\n\nDuring extreme market volatility, short selling has become pronounced and has drawn significant interest from institutional and retail investors. It has prompted regulatory intervention as new reporting requirements have been issued by the SEC to offer transparency and ensure the availability of short position data.\n\nRecent Trends in Short Selling\n\nIn the 2Q 2024, the US and Canadian markets saw an increase of ~$58 billion in short interest or a rise of 5.1% from the previous quarter.\n\nRecently, S3 Partners, a renowned tracker of short-interest data, reported that the sectors that saw the largest increases in short exposure in 2Q 2024 included information technology (a rise of $49.3 billion), communication services (at $11.2 billion), and utilities (a rise of $3.7 billion) from the previous quarter. The sectors that saw the largest decrease in short exposure were the energy and financial sectors, down $12.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n\nEarlier in 2024, a significant surge in the leading AI giant resulted in losses of ~$3 billion for the short sellers. Some market experts even described this as an “AI-generated nightmare.”\n\nIn global equities, short interest climbed during July 2024, with strong increases seen throughout the Automobile (+13bps), REITs (+11bps), and Consumer Durables (+11bps) sectors, reported S&P Global. On the other hand, the largest decreases were in the Financial Services (-10bps) and Real Estate Management and Development (-4bps) sectors.\n\nTalking about the US equities, the average short interest decreased to 77 basis points during July 2024. Significant increases in short interest were seen throughout REITs (+6 basis points) and the Household and Personal Products (+8 basis points) sectors. Conversely, the largest declines were in the Financial Services (-15 basis points) and the Automobile (-9 basis points) sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeavily Shorted Stocks Might Not Always Be in Distress, Says S3 Partners\n\nS3 Partners revealed that there is a relatively weak correlation between short positions in certain assets and distress measures. This means that not all heavily shorted stocks are facing difficulties. As per the firm, broader market sentiments and valuation concerns are some of the factors that can drive short interest.\n\nThe company believes that shorting an asset can form part of broader strategies or hedging activities not linked to distress. It mentioned that there can be 3 measures of bearishness for stocks —- average analyst ratings (From 1 to 5), Credit default swap (CDS) spreads, and Altman Z-Score.\n\nFor example, the US Dollar had a low short position of ~1.32%. However, it had a high CDS spread of 1000 basis points. This indicates high perceived distress on the currency even though there is minimal short interest. This can be because of factors such as currency market dynamics or investor sentiments.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) The Best Big-Name Stock to Buy Right Now According to Short Sellers?\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding (August 15, 2024): 0.77%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an online retailer, offering a wide range of products. Its products include books, music, computers, and numerous other products. The company also operates a cloud platform offering services globally.\n\nThe company’s Prime business, together with its e-commerce efforts, offers a steady stream of high-margin recurring revenue from the customers purchasing more frequently from its properties. Given its leadership position in cloud infrastructure, AWS provides crucial services throughout industries. As more and more businesses adopt cloud-based solutions, AWS seems to be well-placed to capture a significant share in this high-growth market.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) should also benefit from the expected rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Even the slightest reduction in borrowing costs should support the consumer purchasing power. Therefore, the rate cuts can act as a growth catalyst for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s e-commerce segment.\n\nMoreover, the company is well-placed for long-term growth given its network effects, cost advantages, intangible assets, and switching costs. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s business has intangible assets related to technology and branding, the company also has a cost advantage that is tied to purchasing power, logistics, and vertical integration.\n\nInsider Monkey’s 2Q 2024 data revealed that 308 hedge funds held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 302 in the preceding quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Here is what the fund said\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd on our list of the best big name stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating and a price target of $600.\n\nLuria noted Meta Platforms as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most critical future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\n\nThe analyst said Meta Platforms has skillfully positioned itself as the open source leader for major technology platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\n\nUnlike previous revolutionary innovations, Luria noted that a mega-cap could only win these two future platforms.\n\nWhile previous technology innovation was driven by nimble startups, AI and Spatial Computing require unprecedented scale, reach, and capital, the analyst said.\n\nWhile Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are crowding into the closed garden side of these platforms, Meta Platforms has the pole position on the open side, Luria noted.\n\nThe analyst expects the closed-garden side of the AI compute platform to be an expensive fight between the Big Techs, but he noted that Meta is almost entirely alone on the open-source side.\n\nGoogle will need to manage the headwind of transitioning to AI-enhanced Search, Meta is already reporting how the advancements in AI are driving better ad delivery and yields, Luria flagged.\n\nIn spatial computing, the analyst expects the tens of billions Meta Platforms have poured into Reality Labs to become the moat that positions Meta Platforms as the open-source winner alongside Apple’s closed garden.\n\nThe analyst said Meta exemplifies the benefits of being led by its founder more than any other mega-cap, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nLuria’s price target represents 24x 2025 EPS, a premium to Alphabet based on better positioning. The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality Lab’s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\n\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for META\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jul 2020 Desjardins Initiates Coverage On Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests",
        "content": "Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests\n\nBofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $210.\n\nThe re-rating followed Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) and Amazon Web Services’ new partnership, which connects Oracle’s Autonomous Database & Exadata Database and AWS applications.\n\nAWS customers would benefit from more seamless access to their data, simplified database administration, billing, and unified customer support, Post noted.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Targets Walmart’s Grocery Market with Expanded Prime Discounts\n\nPost said that Oracle and Amazon were competitive with database customers. Hence, the new partnership suggests that cloud providers have a sizable opportunity to unlock demand for infrastructure and applications using data housed within Oracle’s databases.\n\nAccording to Oracle, partnerships with leading Cloud providers are already driving growth. AWS CEO Matt Garman also spoke at an investor conference, outlining optimism for artificial intelligence demand and AWS’ differentiated infrastructure.\n\nDespite concerns about AI-related disruption to AWS’ strong Cloud industry position, Post said the CEO commentary suggests optimism on AI-related demand and differentiated AWS AI infrastructure to drive client wins.\n\nAlso, Amazon is walking a fine line between promoting its cost-efficient infrastructure and featuring Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong GPU capabilities. Still, he flagged customer choice as a differentiated and compelling offering.\n\nThe price target reflects Post’s Sum Of The Parts (SOTP) analysis, which values the 1P retail business at 1.2 times 2025E Revenue (including subscription and Prime membership fees), the 3P retail business at 3.0 times 2025E Revenue, AWS at 8.0 times 2025 Sales, and the advertising business at 5.0 times 2025 Sales.\n\nFor 2025E, Post’s 8.0 times AWS multiple is relatively below the analyst’s SaaS comps at 8.5 times, his 1.2 times GMV multiple is a discount to his retail comps at 1.3 times, and his 5.0 times advertising multiple is a discount to his digital advertising comps at 5.2 times, which are warranted given growth rates in excess of peers.\n\nOracle Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Oracle, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Oracle, the 200-day moving average sits at $123.04, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $156.09. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up 2.54% at $179.86 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\nLatest Ratings for AMZN\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Initiates Coverage On Buy Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Amazon and Oracle Partnership Unlocks Major Cloud Growth Opportunity, Analyst Suggests originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Lucid CEO: New midsize cars, EV tech make Lucid a long-term play like Tesla and Amazon",
        "content": "EV maker Lucid Motors (LCID) revealed new information today about its upcoming full-size Gravity SUV at its Technology & Manufacturing Day, along with updated delivery numbers for 2024 and a glimpse of its upcoming midsize SUV.\n\nThe Gravity is still on track for a late 2024 release, CEO Peter Rawlinson said, and it will be made cost-effectively too. Rawlinson believes there is a misunderstanding in the marketplace regarding how expensive it is for Lucid to make its EV tech.\n\n“If you look at our [electric] drive units, not only are they very competitively priced for the power, they're incredibly cheap, but what they enable is a significantly smaller battery, which leads to a very considerable cost saving,” Rawlinson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGerman engineering firm A2MAC1 looked over the data and found a number of cost efficiencies and metrics that showed Lucid topping some competitors in some areas, and at least nearing them in other parts. A2MAC1 and Lucid's analysis of drive unit costs (credit: Lucid Motors) (Lucid Motors)\n\nWith regards to drive units, A2MAC1 found that the Lucid's drive unit cost $1,911 to manufacture, cheaper than 2 of the 3 competitors it was baselined against, however the the drive unit produced more power, and weighed significantly less. When normalized for mass of the drive unit, Lucid's drive unit costs approached the cheapest, which was Competitor A ($1,791 vs $1,653). Though unsaid, Competitor A is most likely Tesla.\n\nWith regards to batteries, the Lucid found that when normalized for size (128 kWh), Lucid's batteries were cheaper than the two other competitors in the study. However when normalized for competitor range, Lucid's batteries - due to their efficiency - produced even more cost savings. Lucid analysis of battery costs vs the competition - Lucid data and Bloomberg's Green Electric Car Ratings (credit: Lucid Motors) (Lucid Motors)\n\nWhile the data is good to see, cost efficiencies may come as a surprise to investors since Lucid lost $790 million in the second quarter, or nearly $330,000 per unit delivered in Q2. Rawlinson stressed he is only talking about costs associated with the powertrain — meaning electric motors, drive units, and batteries — which he said are competitive compared to the industry.\n\nHowever, investors and Wall Street analysts are likely in “prove it” mode when it comes to profits or lack thereof, with the stock down nearly 19% in 2024.\n\nOn the bright side, Rawlinson revealed that the company hit a new sales milestone. “I'm not giving guidance for Q3, but I can announce at this juncture by Aug. 31, we've actually delivered more cars in 2024 by Aug. 31 than we had in the whole of 2023 where we delivered 6,001 [vehicles],” Rawlinson said. Rawlinson did not give a specific figure (third quarter deliveries come out next month), but he acknowledged it was above 6K.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe boost comes as the company has begun selling lower-cost versions of its Lucid Air sedan. The upcoming full-size Gravity SUV should help those numbers considerably, Rawlinson has said in the past, when the base model goes on sale for around $80,000, which is the federal EV tax credit threshold.\n\nThe Gravity will ship with Tesla’s NACS charging inlet built in, providing native access to the substantial Tesla Supercharger network, another bonus for the vehicle. Lucid isn’t taking preorders for the Gravity yet but will do so soon.\n\nMidsize vehicles are coming\n\nLooking ahead, Lucid and Rawlinson are most excited about the upcoming midsize SUV, unnamed at the moment, which will be powered by the just-revealed Atlas drive unit and cost around $50,000 when it goes on sale in 2026.\n\nRawlinson said the Atlas unit is made entirely in-house, smaller, more efficient, and cheaper to make than its current drive units. The Atlas could also find its way up the food chain to cheaper Air sedans and Gravity SUVs.\n\nRawlinson also gave up more details on the future of the midsize vehicle (or vehicles). A teaser image of Lucid's upcoming mid-size SUV. (Lucid Motors) (Lucid Motors)\n\n“There's not just one midsized vehicle, there's a plural. I've not disclosed how many based upon the midsized platform, but I mean that is going to take on the Tesla Model 3, Model Y — bestselling car in the world — but it's going to have Lucid advanced technology,” Rawlinson said.\n\nThe CEO also believes that Lucid’s midsize vehicles will be able to go further distances than the Model Y, for instance, with similar batteries, and that they will be more cost-effective to manufacture down the line.\n\nRawlinson isn’t shy about making these claims, and that might be the point. He’s confident in Lucid’s ability to deliver, but the market may not be so sure and will need more time to see if Lucid’s goals become reality.\n\nThat’s fine with Rawlinson. Lucid is a long-term bet, he said, one that Saudi Arabia’s PIF sovereign wealth fund is deeply committed too.\n\n“My view is [Lucid] is a long-term play; it's like Tesla, it's like Amazon. We've got a long-term strategy.”\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "After more than a decade of competition, Amazon Web Services (AMZN) is changing course on Oracle (ORCL).\n\nOn Wednesday, AWS announced a partnership with Oracle that will allow customers to access Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Exadata Database Service within AWS, making it easier for customers to integrate data and manage databases.\n\nThe partnership is a marriage of former foes. Oracle Database@AWS marks a pivot in the longstanding competitive relationship between the two companies.\n\n\"Hell hath frozen over,\" Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance about the partnership. \"These two companies have been essentially at war with each other since AWS was formed 15 years ago, and AWS's thesis before this was they were going to take out Oracle ... and they would use their database. ... What's clear today ... was that Oracle database is very much alive and well.\"\n\nOracle stock jumped 12% in early trading Thursday on the news, while Amazon stock rose 2%.\n\nAWS CEO Matt Garman spoke to Yahoo Finance about the partnership at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communicopia and Technology Conference on Wednesday. According to Garman, who is three months into his CEO role at AWS, \"We've always wanted to have a broad set of offerings for customers, ... [and] customers do like running on Oracle databases.\"\n\n\"We thought about how integrating AI services into Oracle databases would work,\" Garman said (video above). \"It took us a while to get there, but I do think it's a partnership that strongly benefits customers, and that's something that's good for AWS. It's good for Oracle.\"\n\nThe partnership is certainly a shift. As of Thursday, AWS and Oracle still had blog posts on their websites highlighting challenges and complaints about each other's services. For instance, AWS pointed out complaints about Oracle's \"non-standardized systems\" and \"jaw-dropping\" price increases, while Oracle charged that AWS has complex pricing models and less flexible offerings.\n\nMoorhead noted that the deal is particularly bullish for Oracle stock.\n\n\"Cloud isn’t winner take all and this is a perfect example that it takes a village,\" Moorhead said. \"The most sophisticated investors now see the durability of Oracle database in the cloud. … This event will see more bulls come out.\"\n\nThis partnership also reflects a broader strategy from AWS amid an AI boom that has left tech giants scrambling to be the first and have the best large language model, something Garman said he's not concerned about.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There’s not going to be one model thats going to rule them all,\" Garman said. \"We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\n\nThe strategy has AWS on track for $105 billion in annual revenue, and the stock is currently outpacing the Nasdaq year to date.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "ADDING MULTIMEDIA National Football League and Amazon Web Services Expand Partnership to Further Shape the Future of Football",
        "content": "(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nNFL Media Implements Generative AI Tools to Boost Operational Efficiency\n\nNEW YORK & SEATTLE, September 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Football League and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced an extension of their long-term partnership. Since 2017, the NFL and AWS have been at the forefront of innovation, leveraging AWS's artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to shape the future of football.\n\nThe global partnership will be on display during this week’s games with the debut of a new AI-powered Next Gen Stat that changes how we understand and analyze tackles in football. The Tackle Probability ML model predicts, at any given moment of a play, the likelihood that a given defender will make a tackle, helping to quantify which defenders are the most reliable tacklers and which ball carriers are most elusive. Tackle Probability can be used to calculate various metrics that can be applied to both offensive and defensive analysis, such as missed tackle attempts by a defender and missed tackles forced by a ball carrier.\n\nTo view a video of Tackle Probability in action, please go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqvAiuC7d7U.\n\nPowered by AWS, the Next Gen Stats platform collects over 500 million data points each season. This wealth of data serves as the foundation for innovation throughout the NFL, from enhancing fan engagement through advanced statistics to transforming the viewing experience by enabling alternate broadcasts and new ways of visualizing the action on the field. Additionally, data-driven insights have a direct impact on the game itself by informing rule changes to make the game safer and even more exciting, including the NFL’s new Dynamic Kickoff.\n\nA key component of the partnership renewal is the implementation of generative AI to increase operational efficiency and drive additional value for the league and its fans.\n\n\"Through our collaboration with AWS, we are continuously pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in football,\" said Gary Brantley, chief information officer at the NFL. \"By harnessing the power of data and advanced technologies like generative AI, together we are accelerating the pace of innovation in important areas such as player safety, fan engagement and content production. This season we’ll see an increase in operational efficiency as we begin to leverage AWS’s generative AI capabilities at NFL Media.\"\n\nNFL Media has implemented Amazon Q Business, a generative AI-powered assistant, so users can ask questions and get answers to a wide range of business intelligence and production questions. This enables a self-service helpdesk for common technical and operational questions with detailed and immediate responses. Additionally, NFL Media has launched a generative AI-powered research tool built on Amazon Bedrock that enables the production team to use natural language prompts to retrieve insights and relevant footage from distinct plays throughout the NFL’s Next Gen Stats database quicker than ever before.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese developments will boost employee productivity and enable teams to concentrate on producing high-quality content across NFL Media’s properties including NFL Network, NFL Films, NFL.com, NFL+, the NFL app and the NFL Channel on FAST platforms, as well as the NFL’s social media channels.\n\n\"The NFL and AWS share a passion for innovation and we are excited to continue to drive advancements across the NFL ecosystem,\" said Julie Souza, global head of sports at AWS. \"As we look ahead, this partnership represents an opportunity for the NFL and AWS to reimagine the future of football in a world of quickly evolving technology. By leveraging AWS's cutting-edge capabilities, the NFL will unlock new levels of operational efficiency, further advance player health and safety and deliver unparalleled viewing experiences for fans worldwide.\"\n\nAdditionally, the partnership extension will build upon several industry-leading innovations, including:\n\nNext Gen Stats: The NFL’s proprietary player and ball tracking platform, Next Gen Stats, benefits the entire NFL ecosystem as it is utilized by the league, broadcasters, partners, teams, coaches, scouts and players. The NFL leverages AWS to help manage the scale, speed and complexity of the enormous data set. Further, the NFL utilizes AWS’s machine learning capabilities to help turn the tracking data into advanced statistics that help contextualize the action on the field.  Digital Athlete: This cutting-edge injury recognition and analytics tool provides a complete view of an NFL player’s experience, using video and data from training, practice and in-game action. AWS technology runs millions of simulations of specific in-game and practice scenarios to identify which players are at risk of injury, enabling coaches and training staff to develop individualized injury prevention, training and recovery regimens. The Digital Athlete has also been instrumental in informing recent rule changes, including the NFL’s new, Dynamic Kickoff. The NFL used it to model the new kickoff, simulating 10,000 seasons’ worth of the play to better understand potential risk to players.  NFL Big Data Bowl: The NFL annually hosts the Big Data Bowl powered by AWS, a crowd-sourced competition that challenges applicants to use data and technology to create new insights and make the game more exciting for fans. To date, more than 50 participants in the competition have been hired by NFL teams or league vendors to work in football analytics.  Unified View of the Fan: The NFL has developed a platform on AWS that combines data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of fans across all touchpoints. By leveraging AWS’s advanced analytics capabilities, the league can glean deeper insights into fan behavior, preferences and engagement levels, enabling more personalized and tailored experiences.  NFL Schedule: The NFL uses AWS to power its schedule-making process, running high-performance computing workloads to find the best possible schedule each year from a quadrillion possible combinations.  NFL Films and NFL Media: The NFL utilizes AWS for NFL Films’ digital archive, ensuring that the league’s invaluable content is preserved and accessible for generations to come. Additionally, AWS provides the cloud infrastructure for NFL+, enabling the NFL to strengthen its direct relationship with fans and provide greater access to football content.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Oracle shares rose more than 9% in premarket trading on Tuesday as the cloud computing company's upbeat quarterly results and forecast reinforced investor confidence about its ability to narrow the gap with the market leaders.\n\nThe Texas-based firm's cloud business - viewed as a less expensive option to leaders Microsoft and Amazon - has seen rapid adoption due to integration of artificial intelligence.\n\nOracle's cloud services revenue rose 21% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter. Its overall revenue of $13.31 billion beat estimates of $13.23 billion.\n\n\"Q1 results were good overall and remain fundamentally positive on certain aspects of Oracle's narrative, particularly Oracle's ability to capitalize on AI training-related opportunities,\" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.\n\nOracle's shares have risen more than 32% this year, while Microsoft and Amazon have added 8% and 15%, respectively.\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure is also powered by Nvidia's hardware, widely considered the gold standard for AI semiconductors.\n\nThe company is also partnering with rival cloud service providers to make it simpler for its customers to connect their data across vendors. On Monday, it announced a tie-up with Amazon Web Services, after having signed a similar one with Alphabet's Google Cloud in June.\n\n\"Now with the help of all big three (Azure, Google Cloud and now AWS joining force), we will continue to observe a nice cloud revenue lift as well as growth acceleration thanks to the multi-cloud partnership,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\n\nOracle trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.30, while Microsoft stood at 29.81 and Amazon at 31.59.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Seemingly Infatuated With These 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Between a steady stream of economic data releases and thousands of companies lifting the hood on their operating results every three months, it can be easy for investors to miss an important announcement. Last month, one of the most-critical announcements of the quarter likely went under the radar for some investors.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F gives investors a concise snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's brightest investment minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nEven though this information can be up to 45 days old when filed, 13Fs still offer valuable clues about which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of top money managers -- including billionaire investors.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the June-ended quarter is that, while artificial intelligence (AI) is still a popular trend, billionaires weren't shy about parting ways with shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But while Nvidia was shown to the door, 13Fs make clear that billionaire investors were seemingly infatuated with two other hypergrowth stocks.\n\nSeven billionaire money managers were sellers of Nvidia stock\n\nThe June-ended quarter marked the third consecutive quarter that at least seven prominent billionaire asset managers were sellers of Nvidia stock. The latest round of sellers included (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nConsidering that Nvidia's shares have gained 603% since 2023 began, through the closing bell on Sept. 6, profit-taking is a valid reason that likely explains some of this selling activity. But there's more to this story than just billionaires cashing in their chips for tax or diversification purposes.\n\nTo start with, investor expectations for the AI revolution are probably too lofty. For 30 years, every highly touted innovation and technology has endured a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. This has been a reflection of investors consistently overestimating the uptake of new technologies/innovations by consumers and businesses. Since most companies lack a clearly defined plan for how they'll monetize AI, it's looking likely that artificial intelligence is simply the next in a long line of hyped bubbles.\n\nStory continues\n\nRapidly growing external and internal competition represents another reason for billionaire investors to fade Nvidia.\n\nDespite Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) having clear computing advantages over external competitors, the company's extensive chip backlog, coupled with the considerably cheaper price point for non-Nvidia AI-GPUs, is liable to coerce at least some businesses to turn to its competitors.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are internally developing AI-GPUs that'll be used in their data centers. The writing is on the wall that Nvidia's chips are going to miss out on valuable data center real estate moving forward.\n\nBut while billionaire money managers were busy dumping shares of Nvidia in the second quarter, they were actively piling into the following two supercharged growth stocks. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first high-octane growth stock that billionaire investors were drawn to in the June-ended quarter is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Form 13F filings show that five top-tier billionaire investors were buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,391,262 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,597,676 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,214,055 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,114,948 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (702,235 shares)\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its world-leading online marketplace, this operating segment isn't why these five billionaires purchased shares of Amazon during the second quarter.\n\nThe primary lure for Amazon as an investment is its globally leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Tech analysis firm Canalys pegged Amazon Web Services (AWS) worldwide market share at 33%, as of June 2024. AWS has a sustained double-digit growth rate, is pacing more than $105 billion in annual run-rate sales, and is consistently responsible for between 50% and 100% of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAWS is also Amazon's vessel to take advantage of the rise of AI. The company plans to deploy generative AI solutions to help AWS clients improve their business and better reach consumers. The enterprise cloud and AI revolution are still in their early innings, which bodes exceptionally well for AWS' future.\n\nBut there's more to Amazon than just AWS and its e-commerce platform. Amazon is drawing more than 3 billion visits each month, which makes it a magnet for businesses wanting to advertise. Advertising services revenue has grown by at least 20% on a year-over-year basis for two years.\n\nFurthermore, its growing content library and exclusive sports partnerships -- an 11-year streaming rights deal with the NBA and the streaming rights for Thursday Night Football -- should afford the company exceptional pricing power with its Prime subscription.\n\nNio\n\nThe second hypergrowth stock that billionaires appear to be infatuated with in lieu of Nvidia is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio(NYSE: NIO). In spite of its diminutive nominal share price, which hovered around $5 for much of the second quarter, a half-dozen billionaires piled in, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (4,018,659 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,484,185 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (626,300 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (395,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (30,868 shares)\n\nOn one hand, we've certainly witnessed a cooling in EV demand throughout 2024. Competition has picked up in the EV arena, and consumers have been a bit leery to take the plunge given the lack of available EV charging infrastructure. But in spite of these challenges, we've witnessed meaningful sales growth and a sizable production ramp from Nio.\n\nSince China lifted its cumbersome COVID-19 mitigation measures in December 2022, Nio has enjoyed a fairly steady production expansion. The absence of supply chain constraints has allowed the company to produce around 20,000 EVs per month. Through August, deliveries were up nearly 36% from the comparable period in 2023.\n\nNio also wins with its innovation. It's been introducing at least one new EV annually for years, and has taken advantage of an increase in demand since rolling out its NT 2.0 platform, which incorporates an assortment of new driver assistance features.\n\nTo add, Nio introduced its ONVO brand to the world in May. Whereas Nio has traditionally focused on premium EVs, the ONVO brand is more family oriented and will provide a potentially more palatable price point for Chinese consumers.\n\nLastly, the efforts of management to keep costs under control while improving margins are beginning to pay off. Vehicle margin jumped six percentage points in the June-ended quarter to 12.2% from the prior-year period, while adjusted net loss shrank close to 17%. Though Nio still has a lot of work to do to reach profitability, it's taking steps in the right direction.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "29.5% of Warren Buffett's $305.7 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has been at the helm of the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company since 1965. During his 59 years of leadership, Berkshire Hathaway stock has delivered a compound annual return of 19.8%, which would have been enough to turn an investment of $1,000 back then into more than $42.5 million today.\n\nBuffett's investment strategy is simple. He looks for growing companies with robust profitability and strong management teams, and he especially likes those with shareholder-friendly programs like dividend payments and stock-buyback plans.\n\nOne thing Buffett doesn't focus on is the latest stock market trend, so you won't find him piling money into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks right now. However, two stocks Berkshire already holds are becoming significant players in the AI industry, and they account for about 29.5% of the total value of the conglomerate's $305.7 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple: 28.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company with a $3.3 trillion market capitalization, but it was worth a fraction of that when Buffett started buying the stock in 2016. Between then and 2023, Berkshire spent about $38 billion building its stake in Apple, and thanks to a staggering return, that position had a value of more than $170 billion earlier this year.\n\nHowever, Berkshire has sold more than half of its stake in the iPhone maker during the past few months. Its remaining position is still worth $88.3 billion, so it's still the largest holding in the conglomerate's portfolio, and I think the recent sales reflect Buffett's cautious view on the broader market as opposed to Apple itself. After all, the S&P 500 is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27.6 right now, which is significantly more expensive than its average of 18.1 going back to the 1950s.\n\nBesides, Apple is preparing for one of the most important periods in its history. With more than 2.2 billion active devices globally -- including iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers -- Apple could become the world's biggest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nThe company unveiled Apple Intelligence earlier this year, which it developed in partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It's embedded in the new iOS 18 operating system, and it will only be available on the latest iPhone 16 and the previous iPhone 15 Pro models because they are fitted with next-generation chips designed to process AI workloads.\n\nConsidering Apple Intelligence is going to transform many of the company's existing software applications, it could drive a big upgrade cycle for the iPhone. Apps like Notes, Mail, and iMessage will feature new writing tools capable of instantly summarizing and generating text content on command. Plus, Apple's existing Siri voice assistant is going to be enhanced by ChatGPT, which will bolster its knowledge base and its capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Apple's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent quarters, the company still ticks nearly all of Buffett's boxes. It's highly profitable, it has an incredible management team led by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, and it's returning truckloads of money to shareholders through dividends and buybacks -- in fact, Apple recently launched a new $110 billion stock buyback program, which is the largest in corporate American history.\n\nThere is no guarantee Berkshire has finished selling Apple stock, but the rise of AI will likely drive a renewed phase of growth for the company, so that's a good reason to remain bullish no matter what Buffett does next.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought a relatively small stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2019, which is currently worth $1.7 billion and represents just 0.6% of the conglomerate's portfolio. However, Buffett has often expressed regret for not recognizing the opportunity much sooner, because Amazon has expanded beyond its roots as an e-commerce company and now has a dominant presence in streaming, digital advertising, and cloud computing.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest business-to-business cloud platform in the world, offering hundreds of solutions designed to help organizations operate in the digital era. But AWS also wants to be the go-to provider of AI solutions for businesses, which could be its largest financial opportunity ever.\n\nAWS developed its own data center chips like Trainium, which can offer cost savings of up to 50% compared to competing hardware from suppliers like Nvidia. Plus, the cloud provider also built a family of large language models (LLMs) called Titan, which developers can use if they don't want to create their own. They are accessible through Amazon Bedrock, along with a portfolio of third-party LLMs from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic. LLMs are at the foundation of every AI chat bot application.\n\nFinally, AWS now offers its own AI assistant called Q. Amazon Q Business can be trained on an organization's data so employees can instantly find answers to their queries, and it can also generate content to boost productivity. Amazon Q Developer, on the other hand, can debug and generate code to help accelerate the completion of software projects.\n\nAccording to consulting firm PwC, AI could add a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and the combination of chips, LLMs, and software apps will help Amazon stake its claim to that enormous pie.\n\nAmazon was consistently losing money when Berkshire bought the stock, and it doesn't offer a dividend nor does it have a stock buyback program, so it doesn't tick many of Buffett's boxes (hence the small position). But it might be the most diverse AI stock investors can buy right now, and Berkshire will likely be pleased with its long-term return from here even if Buffett wishes it owned a bigger stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got a Grim Warning From Apple and Amazon",
        "content": "Semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\n\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\n\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\nApple's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\n\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\n\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\n\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's the 'magical' moment Goldman Sachs sees for tech stocks",
        "content": "To get big tech stocks powering higher again, it will take the convergence of two factors, says Goldman Sachs' veteran tech analyst Kash Rangan.\n\nThe magic formula is a steady dose of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve combined with a burst of innovation that jumpstarts earnings growth in excess of 20%.\n\n\"We have to get the industry back from an 11% growth rate to 20%-30% and to do that, new innovation has to happen,\" Rangan told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference on Monday.\n\nRangan — a bull on Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) — says the tech sector must deliver on the AI front in areas like upselling customers and monetization.\n\n\"When you compound that innovation with lower rates, magic happens,\" Rangan said.\n\nInvestor attention is squarely on the Fed as it nears its next monetary policy decision on Sept. 18.\n\nThe Fed has widely telegraphed its first rate cut in several years as it looks to stabilize an economy that's beginning to slow.\n\n\"I wouldn't rule out 50 basis points, but 25 basis points strikes me as more likely,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius told Yahoo Finance at the conference.\n\n\"I think there is a solid rationale for doing [a 50 basis point cut]. And the rationale is that five and three-eighths, five and a quarter to 5.5% is a really high fed funds rate. It's the highest policy rate in the G10. It is despite the fact that the US has actually seen more progress on inflation than most G10 economies,\" Hatzius added.\n\nAs for the other component, that may take a little more time — although signs of fresh innovation inside the AI growth story is beginning to surface.\n\nSalesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me in late August the company is on the cusp of releasing AI powered digital agents that can help businesses automate customer service. Salesforce will charge the usage by conversation, Benioff says.\n\nMeantime, AMD (AMD) chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su took the veil off a series of new AI chips through 2026 in an interview at the conference today.\n\n\"AI is a much larger cycle than I would have expected five years ago,\" Su said.\n\nTo be sure, tech stocks could use a little magic right now.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has shed about 5% in September as investors take profits in hot AI trades amid fears of slowing economic growth. Investors have also been concerned about an AI spending slowdown, triggered in part by mixed second quarter earnings from chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia is off by a whopping 11% month to date, with AMD down 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The recent performance [of Nvidia's stock] hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance at the conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons (AMZN), the Googles (GOOGL), the Microsofts (MSFT) of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

The average selling price for toys was relatively unchanged at $11.57.\n\nOnly four of the 11 toy \"super-categories\" experienced sales growth from the G12 countries, underscoring the pressure the category is under.\n\nOne bright spot: sales of building sets rose 20% in the first half of the year.\n\nToy sales have \"stabilized,\" said Circana global toys industry adviser Frederique Tutt.\n\n\"As we move through the second half of the year and prepare for the holiday season, we expect to see more new products being launched that will deliver excitement for children and adults alike. The industry will continue to gain traction in product categories including building sets, plush, robotic interactive pets, and collectibles,\" Tutt added.\n\nMattel's second quarter sales fell 1% year over over year to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings improved to $0.19 from $0.10 a year ago as Mattel continued to benefit from cost cuts and share repurchases.\n\nFor the full year, Mattel sees sales relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion. Adjusted earnings pegged to increase 14% year over year at the mid-point of Mattel's guidance of $1.35 to $1.45 a share.\n\n\"While we are encouraged by the first half performance, we continue to believe the upcoming year will be a challenging operating environment for the toy space. Mattel is lapping difficult comparisons from last year's Barbie movie with a lackluster movie slate ahead,\" Jefferies analyst Kylie Cohu said in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nCohu rates Mattel shares at a Hold.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "Nvidia stock sell-off is overdone, Goldman Sachs analyst says",
        "content": "Goldman Sachs isn't scared off by the latest Nvidia (NVDA) sell-off.\n\nNvidia shed roughly $400 billion in market value last week after the stock fell nearly 10% on Tuesday. The tech stock was one of the biggest drivers of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) worst start to September since 1953, according to Bespoke Investment Group, though it recovered some of its losses on Monday.\n\nDespite the selling, Toshiya Hari, a lead analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintained a Buy rating on the chip giant. When asked if the sell-off in Nvidia stock was overdone, Hari said, \"Yes, we do.\"\n\n\"The recent performance hasn't been great, but we do remain positive on the stock,\" Hari told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"First of all, demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong. We tend to spend quite a bit of time on the hyperscalers — the Amazons, the Googles, the Microsofts of the world — but you are seeing a broadening in the demand profile into enterprise, even at the sovereign states.\"\n\nNvidia's sell-off began when the company's better-than-expected earnings print on Aug. 28 just wasn't good enough for Wall Street. While Nvidia’s revenue beat Wall Street expectations by 4.1%, that was the smallest margin for the company since its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe big debate around Nvidia is whether its earnings momentum is sustainable. Hari said that investors are questioning whether that will be the case not only for 2025 but for 2026 too.\n\nInvestor sentiment on artificial intelligence has \"swung nearly 180 [degrees]\" since early 2023, Goldman's equity research team wrote in a recent note. Investors' patience is wearing thin, and they want to be shown — not told about — AI-driven revenue streams and profit margin improvements.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nStill, the Goldman team wrote, with a profound generational technology shift such as AI, \"it would be futile to pass judgment based on near-term cost and return economics.\"\n\nThe focus is on the long game: Goldman estimates that generative AI will begin materially contributing to sector growth by the second half of 2025.\n\n\"I think their competitive position continues to be really strong,\" Hari said of Nvidia. \"We do think within merchant silicon, Nvidia is the go-to, and even versus custom silicon, they've got the edge in terms of the pace of innovation.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the conference on Wednesday morning.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Temu's growth in the U.S. market is beginning to show signs of deceleration, according to a note from Bank of America on Monday.\n\nCiting data from Bloomberg Second Measure (BSM), BofA analysts noted that Temu's observed sales growth in the U.S. slowed to 37% year-over-year in August, down from 45% in July and significantly lower than the 99% growth seen in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThis slowdown comes after a period of rapid expansion in 2023, when Temu's market share ramped up significantly.\n\nBofA analysts attribute the deceleration to tough year-over-year comparisons and plateauing sales, with Temu's market share relative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stabilizing at around 3% in the first seven months of 2024.\n\nHowever, Temu saw a slight 40 basis point increase in August, bringing its share to 3.4%. Despite this, daily active users (DAUs) have been on the decline, dropping 17% year-over-year in August, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\n\"BSM data also indicates that absolute sales dollars vs. Amazon had seemingly plateaued at around 3% in the first 7 months of 2024, after ramping in 2023, though we do note a solid 40bps m/m in August to 3.4% (Temu grew 3.5% m/m while Amazon was down m/m following Prime Day),\" wrote BofA.\n\nThe note also highlights comments from Temu's parent company, Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: PDD), which noted that \"high revenue growth is not sustainable\" and pointed to new challenges, including a shift toward quality over low prices and increasing global competition.\n\nPDD is said to be taking steps to address these challenges by supporting higher-quality merchants and removing \"bad actors\" from its platform.\n\nWhile Temu's slowing growth may have a limited impact on the broader U.S. eCommerce sector, BofA analysts caution that online advertisers like Meta (NASDAQ:META) could face slight headwinds.\n\nWith 10% of Meta's revenue coming from China-based advertisers, a slowdown in ad spend from companies like Temu and Shein could pose a minor challenge, though the bank says that broader declines would be needed for a significant impact.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTemu growth is slowing down in the US: BofA\n\nUS SEC hits 7 public companies with penalties for violating whistleblower protections\n\nUS stocks open higher following biggest weekly sell-off in more than a year\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share, indicating a change of +35.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Hayden Capital, an investment management firm, released its second-quarter 2024 investment letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Driven by the core positions, the portfolio rose in the past few months. The firm is currently seeing signs of market stabilization following the erratic macroeconomic environment of the past few years. In the second quarter, the portfolio generated a 7.0% return compared to a 4.3% return for the S&P 500 and a 2.9% return for the MSCI World Index. The firm’s assets are invested in Asia at approximately 57%, in North America at approximately 41%, and the remainder in cash. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\n\nHayden Capital highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores that operates through North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments. The one-month return of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was 2.75%, and its shares gained 19.77% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 6, 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock closed at $171.39 per share with a market capitalization of $1.799 trillion.\n\nHayden Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Our portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we’ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today\n\nSome of our biggest winners in the last two years, have been “re-acceleration” stories. These are cases where once rapidly growing companies suddenly put the brakes on during a weak economy. There could be several reasons for this – customers pulling back during a recession, the company proactively curtailing growth spend as a precaution, needing to cut costs & right-size the business to become profitable quickly, or many other reasons.\n\nBut the commonality seems to be that as soon as growth stops, the market narrative turns suddenly from positive, to “this company is finished”. They go from being valued for many years of rapid growth, to being priced like a mature company that will never realize significant growth again. But often neither scenario is true, with the ultimate future path somewhere in between.\n\nI find the fact this type of opportunity even exists, fascinating. Especially since it seems to happen every bear-market – perhaps indicating it’s embedded in human nature (and thus persistent & likely minable throughout one’s investing career). For example, I gave the examples of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock performance in our Q1 2022 letter (please re-read this piece for more context; LINK)...\" (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in first position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 308 hedge fund portfolios held Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the second quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. In the second quarter, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Workers at several large US tech companies overwhelmingly back Kamala Harris, data shows",
        "content": "By Arriana McLymore\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Workers at many of the largest U.S. tech companies overwhelmingly back Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, according to donation data, even as some of the most powerful tech billionaires have thrown their support to Republican rival Donald Trump.\n\nWorkers at Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are donating millions of dollars to the Harris campaign, significantly more than employees who are opting to send money to former President Trump’s camp, according to the data compiled by political watchdog OpenSecrets. The data includes donations made by company employees, owners, and workers' and owners' immediate family members.\n\nHowever, tech billionaires like Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz co-founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz are rallying behind Trump, citing the former president's stances on the economy, taxes and big business.\n\nThe Nov. 5 presidential election has riven Silicon Valley, once a bastion of democratic and liberal support. Venture capitalist Reid Hoffman from Greylock and entrepreneur Mark Cuban are pledging support for Harris’ White House bid, with hopes of seeing more abortion rights for workers and pro-tech policies.\n\nBut in recent years several other tech leaders have bristled at Democratic President Joe Biden’s business policies, including a broad attack on mergers and acquisitions and clamping down on data privacy.\n\nCompanies themselves can not directly donate to federal campaigns, including presidential ones, according to campaign finance laws. Corporations often donate to congressional and state-level campaigns through political action committees, which are funded by employee donations and limited on how much candidates can receive.\n\n“Many businesses serve customers on both sides of the political aisle, and they don't want to alienate customers by making contributions that support just one party or one candidate in a partisan race,” said Michael Beckel, research director at campaign finance reform nonprofit Issue One. While corporations are blocked from sending money directly to presidential candidates, their employees aren't, and tech employees are overwhelmingly giving to Harris.\n\nEmployees at Alphabet and its subsidiaries, which includes Google, and their family members have donated $2.16 million so far to Harris’ campaign, nearly 40 times as much as Trump has received, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nAmazon and Microsoft employees and family members donated $1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Trump’s campaign pulled in $116,000 from Amazon workers and $88,000 from Microsoft workers, as well as their family members.\n\nStory continues\n\nEmployees at Amazon, which is also a top U.S. retailer and the second largest employer in the country, are outpacing donations from other e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail workers.\n\nFor example, Walmart workers have donated a total of $275,000 to both Harris and Trump, with both presidential candidates receiving nearly the same amount in funding. Trump’s campaign is taking in $144,000 from Walmart workers, about $14,000 more than Harris’.\n\nCampaign donations mostly come from corporate employees who have more disposable income than the typical warehouse worker or cashier, said Sarah Bryner, director of research and strategy for OpenSecrets. Bryner said Amazon and other tech company corporate employees often make more money than those at Walmart, giving them more leeway to contribute to political campaigns.\n\nAmazon corporate employees on average make more money than Walmart corporate employees, who are often based in Bentonville, Arkansas. Amazon’s U.S. corporate employees take home an average of $133,000 per year, while Walmart’s corporate workers’ average annual salary is $85,000, according to data from job marketplace ZipRecruiter.\n\nWorkers and family members at Meta and Apple haven’t hit the $1 million mark in donations to Harris yet, but they are continuing the trend of outpacing contributions to Trump. Meta employees have donated $25,000 to Trump compared with $835,000 to Harris, while Apple employees donated $44,000 to Trump compared with $861,000 to Harris.\n\nSilicon Valley has traditionally been seen as more left-leaning in the U.S. In August, more than 100 venture capitalists said in a letter they would support Harris, who has been considered pro-innovation on business and technology.\n\n(Reporting by Arriana McLymore in New York City; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – September 9, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Roche Holding AG RHHBY, GE Aerospace GE, Canterbury Park Holding Corp. CPHC and NVE Corp. NVEC.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Amazon.com, Roche and GE Aerospace\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Roche Holding AG  and GE Aerospace, as well as two micro-cap stocks Canterbury Park Holding Corp. and NVE Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nAmazon.com shares have lost ground lately, along with the rest of its Magnificent 7 peers and other megacap Tech operators, but they have still been strong performers this year (up +13.7% vs. +15.3% for the S&P 500 index. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\n\nAmazon.com’s expanding global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses, remain a plus. Growing adoption of AWS is aiding Amazon’s cloud dominance. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\n\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Amazon issued weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance due to the changing shopping pattern of consumers, which is a negative.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\n\nShares of Roche have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months (+22.0% vs. +4.1%). The company's performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2024 was impressive because of the high demand for its drugs and tests.\n\nThe second quarter saw an acceleration in growth as total sales were no longer affected by the decline in COVID-19 sales, resulting in very strong sales growth. Consequently, Roche raised its earnings outlook for the full year. Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Evrysdi and Polivy boost growth. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Roche is also looking to diversify and make inroads in the lucrative obesity market in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs due to competition from biosimilars. The company’s efforts to develop new drugs are encouraging. The base diagnostics business is also performing well.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)\n\nShares of GE Aerospace have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry over the past six months (+25.1% vs. +7.7%). The company has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies.\n\nRising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. GE Aerospace remains committed to making investments to boost growth and provide better services to its customers.\n\nIts portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. For 2024, it expects organic revenues to grow in the high-single-digit range from the year-ago level. However, it has been dealing with high costs and expenses related to projects and restructuring activities.\n\n(You can read the full research report on GE here >>>)\n\nCanterbury Park’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the year-to-date period (-0.6% vs. +6.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $100.78 million offers significant long-term revenue potential through diversified projects like an amphitheater, Winners Circle and residential units, driving growth beyond traditional gaming.\n\nFinancially stable with $24 million in cash and short-term investments, Canterbury Park can fund growth without debt. Improved EBITDA margins and diversified revenue streams, including pari-mutuel wagering and event hosting, support CPHC’s earnings stability. The company’s vision of a regional destination is progressing, with leasing success indicating solid demand.\n\nHowever, risks include a 93.6% drop in second-quarter 2024 net income due to a non-recurring gain in 2023, weak casino revenues and substantial losses from equity investments. Increased competition from nearby casinos could impact market share and profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Canterbury Park here >>>)\n\nShares of NVE have gained +0.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s gain of +16.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $367.89 million exhibits strong margins in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, with gross margin rising to 86% and operating margin at 65%, driven by a profitable product mix and direct sales.\n\nThe company's increased R&D spending by 26%, especially in wafer-level chip scale packaging aimed at medical and industrial applications, expected to drive new revenue streams. Despite a 24% sales decline due to semiconductor downturns, strong cash flows and a $53 million cash reserve support a steady $1.00 per share dividend. NVE Corporation's focus on spintronic technologies positions it well in high-growth sectors.\n\nHowever, revenue risks persist with heavy reliance on key customers and competitive pressures. Rising operating expenses and labor market challenges may pressure near-term profitability, while supply-chain vulnerabilities and inventory management issues could impact operational efficiency.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\n\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\n\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\n\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\n\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\n\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\n\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\n\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 308\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $60.8 million\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American eCommerce company that has also diversified its business into the lucrative cloud computing market. Its eCommerce site attracted 3.25 billion users in June, which provides the firm with a sizeable customer base and increases its value to merchants and advertisers. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud business and its tech focused approach have also allowed it to bring its very own AI model under its fold. The firm's partnership with Anthropic has enabled Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to use the Claude AI model. This enables it to build a variety of internal and external AI driven services on a foundational base, meaning that the company does not have to pay fees to others for using AI. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also working on all three layers of the AI stack, from developing its own chips, to building a foundation model and developing AI applications. This could position the firm nicely to benefit from all aspects of AI demand in the future.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s management provided key details for its AI work during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we’re building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we’ve heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It’s why we’ve invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\n\nAnd the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling in price performance. We’re seeing significant demand for these chips. These model builders also desire services that make it much easier to manage the data, construct the models, experiment, deploy to production, and achieve high-quality performance, all while saving considerable time and money. That’s what Amazon SageMaker does so well, including its most recently launched feature called HyperPods that changes the game and networking performance for large models. And we’re increasingly seeing model builders standardized on SageMaker. While many teams will build their own models, lots of others will leverage somebody else’s frontier model, customize it with their own data and seek a service that provides broad model selection and great generative AI capabilities.\n\nThis is what we think of as the middle layer, what Amazon Bedrock does and why Bedrock has tens of thousands of companies using it already. Bedrock has the largest selection of models, the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG and agenting, and then makes it easy to switch between different model types and model sizes. Bedrock has recently added Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 models, which are the best performing models on the planet. Meta’s new Llama 3.1 models and Mistral’s new Large two models. And Lama’s and Mistral’s impressive performance benchmarks in open nature are quite compelling to our customers as well. At the application or top layer, we’re continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data.\n\nQ has the highest known score and acceptance rate for code suggestions, but it does a lot more than provide code suggestions. It tests code, outperforms all other publicly benchmarkable competitors on catching security vulnerabilities and leads all software development assistants on connecting multiple steps together and applying automatic action. It also saves development teams time and money on the muck nobody likes to talk about. For instance, when companies decide to upgrade from one version of a framework to another, it takes development teams many months, sometimes years, burning valuable opportunity costs and churning developers who hate this tedious, though important work. With Q’s code transformation capabilities, Amazon has migrated over 30,000 Java JDK applications in a few months, saving the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years compared to what it would have otherwise cost.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Wall Street veteran Alex Green issues warning to Americans who invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks\n\nFor many investors, stocks that pay dividends represent the height of reliability. Just witness the track records of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and its main competitor PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP): Both rank among the 53 “dividend kings” that have increased shareholder payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nYet the question remains whether paying dividends is really the most resourceful option.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n\"There are some companies that are growing so rapidly that the best use of their cash is not to pay dividends to shareholders or even to buy back their own shares, but to reinvest in their own operations” said The Oxford Club’s Chief Investment Strategist Alex Green in a recent interview with finance YouTuber Ari Gutman.\n\nMarket giants like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have opted over time for the latter. That sets the stage for more growth, which can in turn lead to higher share prices.\n\nGreen recalled a time more than 24 years ago when he worked on Wall Street and advised a client to buy shares in billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A). The client, who was retired, took a pass because they wanted some steady income and the company didn't pay out dividends. (It still doesn't.)\n\n\"Think how well he would have done if he'd have bought those shares of Berkshire and just sold a little bit off each year if he needed some income,\" Green said. “That’s what everyone needs is return, not income.”\n\nWe did the math and since the year 2000, the stock has soared by more than 1,200%.\n\nHow dividends work — and sometimes fall short\n\nA dividend is a shareholder payout companies make, usually on a quarterly basis, based on their profits. Many investors like them because it can act as a steady source of income.\n\nFor example, sitting atop the “dividend kings” utilities sector you’ll find two businesses that have upped their dividend growth for 69 consecutive years: American States Water (NYSE:AWR) and Northwest Natural (NYSE:NWN). This is as ranked by Simply Safe Dividends whose tagline says it all: \"We're boring and conservative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet as Green’s too-careful client learned the hard way, boring and conservative can be humbling and costly. Consider the aforementioned Amazon, a high-flying company whose stock is doing better now than it has over the last two years. Since last year, the stock is up by more than 100%.\n\nOut of 65 analysts surveyed by the Wall Street Journal, 54 call it a \"buy.\" And it has never offered a dividend. Compare that to American States Water, whose stock has lowered over the same period.\n\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year — but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\n\nPiecing the puzzle together\n\nSkepticism over dividend-centered investing is nothing new. But it’s not that dividend stocks are bad bets in and of themselves; rather, they can be part of a balanced portfolio that could include even more conservative investments such as bonds and riskier ones such as cryptocurrency.\n\nMeanwhile, tech-sector companies that famously resisted dividends have gotten into the game. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) started paying out dividends in 2012, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gave out its first-ever dividends in June 2024.\n\nJust a few months prior, Meta (NASDAQ:META) announced its first dividend effective Feb. 22. In each case, the dividend marked a point where the companies had matured past their go-go stages and had plenty of money to sit on. All three today boast market caps measured in trillions of dollars.\n\nGreen urged investors to think of stocks not just in terms of dividends, which many treat as income, but total returns. If a stock skyrockets, its share price will far outpace even the biggest dividend; in the S&P 500, that's offered by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).\n\n“I have nothing against dividend investing,” he said. “A lot of smart people are dividend oriented and there are a lot of great dividend-paying stocks out there. But I just would warn people not to invest exclusively in dividend-paying stocks.”\n\nWhat to read next\n\nUnlock access to 4,700+ hand-picked, single-family homes across America — and the juicy rental cash they can generate.

        "title": "Amazon Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "Investing doesn't have to be complicated. Sometimes, it's just about checking a few important boxes. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has checked those boxes for years, and that's primarily why it's one of the best-performing stocks Wall Street has ever seen.\n\nBut what are those boxes, and does Amazon still have what it takes to make investors money? Let's explore whether Amazon is a buy, sell, or hold today.\n\nAre Amazon's competitive moats still intact?\n\nAmazon started as an online bookstore in the late 1990s and has become a one-stop shop for consumers across America. Today, you can buy almost anything from Amazon; roughly 200 million households pay for Amazon's Prime subscription to unlock all of the company's products, services, and perks. Amazon didn't stop there; it began selling its information technology services to customers via Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, and it's the world's leading cloud platform today.\n\nAmazon does over $600 billion in annual revenue across its businesses. It dominates U.S. e-commerce with an estimated 38% of the U.S. market. AWS controls 31% of the world's cloud market. Being the largest comes with competitive advantages. For example, its tremendous supply chain and logistics network can deliver more products faster than other e-commerce stores. It can also use its size as leverage with sellers to achieve the lowest prices. It's a similar story in AWS, where companies get more value from Amazon than others, aside from maybe Microsoft's Azure, the next-largest cloud platform with a 25% market share.\n\nAt this point, Amazon's biggest threat could be U.S. regulators, who may want to break up Amazon's dominance rather than other companies knocking it off its top spot in e-commerce and cloud.\n\nCan Amazon still grow?\n\nAll companies mature and slow down eventually, and Amazon is no different. However, the fact that Amazon can still grow revenue at a double-digit rate at its size is remarkable: AMZN Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon's growth-oriented culture means the company could keep growing larger. For starters, e-commerce still represents only 16% of total retail spending in the United States. Amazon should benefit if that continues to expand. Meanwhile, the world's shift from on-premise computing to the cloud is ongoing. Experts believe the global cloud services market could grow by 21% annually through 2030, so there is still a lot of opportunity there, too.\n\nThese are just Amazon's two core businesses. The company has invested in media to grow its advertising business, including securing rights to live sports in the NFL and NBA. The company is also wading into the healthcare field. Amazon has the deep pockets to continue pushing into new categories and is willing to make those efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs the stock priced right?\n\nSo far, so good, right? Amazon is a juggernaut with the means to grow for years to come, but no stock is worth paying any price for. The good news is that high-quality stocks like Amazon only need a fairprice to create fantastic long-term returns. However, Amazon is offering something even better: It's a relative bargain.\n\nShares trade at a forward P/E of 38, while analysts believe Amazon will grow earnings by an average of 23% annually over the long term. Its PEG ratio of 1.6 indicates a reasonably priced stock for its expected earnings growth. I usually look for PEG ratios around 1.5 or lower if possible.\n\nSo, what makes the stock a bargain? Amazon is known for aggressively reinvesting profits into the business to grow the company, so earnings don't always tell the whole story. Instead, investors can value the stock against the day-to-day cash flow Amazon's business generates. Using that, the stock is near its lowest ratio in a decade! AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon's stock is reasonably priced or a flat-out deal, depending on how you want to value it.\n\nBuy, sell, or hold Amazon?\n\nGreat investments happen when you can check all the boxes.\n\nAmazon does that today. The company is as dominant as ever in e-commerce and continues to lead in the cloud. These existing businesses could still grow for years to come. Meanwhile, Amazon is leaning into new opportunities. Lastly, the stock trades at a price that should allow Amazon's wonderful business traits to translate to similarly stellar investment returns over time.\n\nThat makes the stock a no-brainer buy for any long-term investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Smart investing means staying patient. Indeed, numerous studies agree: The longer someone stays invested in the stock market, the greater their returns.\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a closer look at two fantastic buy-and-hold candidates and explore why long-term investors should seriously consider them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first no-brainer stock I want to highlight is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). There are dozens of reasons to own this iconic company, but let's focus a bit on a few key financial metrics that explain why Amazon is a great stock to own for the long term.\n\nFirst, Amazon is enormous. Its annual revenue is over $600 billion, trailing only Walmart in terms of revenue generated by an American company.\n\nSecond, despite its massive size, Amazon is growing impressively. Its revenue is growing at around 10% year over year, meaning that, at its current size, Amazon is adding about $60 billion per year in new sales.\n\nThird, Amazon is on the cutting edge of some of the world's most exciting new technologies. The company's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is generating much of that new annual revenue, as it is growing at a faster clip than the rest of the company -- roughly 19% year over year. In addition, Amazon is a pioneer in the robotics industry -- with over 750,000 robots working day and night in its fulfillment centers. Finally, the company has many artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, including using generative AI to streamline its e-commerce business and its ubiquitous voice-powered echo devices.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's large and growing sales figures show that the company continues to find new ways to serve its existing customers and attract new ones. Over the next decade, Amazon remains a no-brainer stock to own thanks to its combination of proven businesses and innovative new ventures.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe next no-brainer stock to own is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).The reason Meta is such an obvious pick is that the company delivers on the most important factor for any stock: It drives shareholder value.\n\nWhat I mean is that Meta generates a ton of free cash flow -- which is the lifeblood of any great stock.\n\nThink of a garden hose. When the spigot is fully open, water comes flying out at a rapid pace. The more the valve is closed, the less water makes it out the other end of the hose.\n\nIn the case of a company, the valve represents operating expenses and capital spending, and the water represents free cash flow -- it's what's left over after employee salaries, taxes, capital expenditures, and many other costs have been subtracted from revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's so great about Meta is that the company generates a ton of free cash flow. Moreover, its total keeps on growing larger. META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nOver the last 10 years, Meta has increased its free cash flow from about $3 billion to almost $50 billion. That's astounding. Bear in mind that many large companies you've heard of don't generate $50 billion in sales, let alone free cash flow.\n\nSimply put, Meta's free cash flow makes it a stock market juggernaut. With so much free cash flow at its disposal, the company can return value to its shareholders in any number of ways, including paying dividends, repurchasing shares, or making acquisitions.\n\nIn short, it gives Meta's management many ways to increase its share price. And that's something that should make investors happy for many years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Did This ESG Stock Receive a Good Rating from Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other ESG stocks.\n\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it’s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn’t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\n\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45°C—closer than ever to the 1.5°C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists’ initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\n“If you solely look at climate as your window, you’ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.”\n\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market’s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve’s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as “woke” investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\n\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren’t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the ‘Magnificent Seven’, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 3.55%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) initially aimed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 and power its operations with 100% renewable energy, a goal it claims to have achieved seven years ahead of schedule. In July 2020, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched The Climate Pledge Fund to accelerate the development of sustainable technologies and services in line with The Climate Pledge. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is backing nearly 1.7 GW of capacity across six offshore wind farms in Europe, which, when fully operational, are expected to generate enough energy to power 1.8 million average European homes. These initiatives make Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) the world’s leading corporate buyer of offshore wind energy.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its operating income surge 141% year-over-year, reaching a record high. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the primary driver of this profit, contributing 84% of the company’s second-quarter operating income. As a leading cloud platform, AWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making Amazon’s performance a crucial factor in future profit forecasts.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also a dominant force in digital advertising, surpassing a $50 billion annual run rate with 20% growth. The company generated $53 billion in free cash flow over the past year and remains appealing at its current share price, bolstered by strong cash flow yields.\n\nMorgan Stanley recently reiterated its positive outlook on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), maintaining an Overweight rating and a $210 price target. The firm remains optimistic about AMZN’s financial prospects, noting that the stock is currently trading at 21 times Morgan Stanley’s projected 2026 free cash flow. This valuation suggests a 30% growth rate in free cash flow per share CAGR from 2024 to 2026, representing a roughly 30% discount compared to the median growth-adjusted multiple of Amazon’s mega-cap tech peers.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\n“There is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\n\nAnd I’m not talking about economics here—you could be an econ major and still learn nothing about financial planning or retirement readiness, let alone investing. Money is just not talked about. Frankly, it’s become the third rail of American education. You’re a thousand times more likely to read Marx’s “Das Kapital” than to read anything about planning a budget or picking stocks.”\n\nCramer’s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\n“That’s why I’m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you’re going to stop working—hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I’m betting most of you, even if you don’t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\n\nDecades ago, corporate pensions started going the way of the dodo, and now the 401(k) is the main way that Americans save for retirement. They’re offered by your employer, and they’re among the greatest tax-deferred investment vehicles out there, along with the IRA. And I’m not talking about the Irish Republican Army—I’m not even talking about the Inflation Reduction Act, for that matter. I mean the Individual Retirement Account.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it’s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\n“Hear me out, darn it—you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there’s a lot the so-called experts don’t tell you or don’t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)—you’d have to be a fool not to contribute.\n\nMany experts will even advise you to max out your 401(k) contributions every year if you can afford to. Right now, the maximum contribution is over 20 grand, with room for an additional 7 grand if you’re over 50. It tends to rise gradually over time, usually a little faster than inflation. In 2004, it was $13,000; by 2023, it was $22,500. Either way, that’s a serious chunk of change, even with these contributions coming from your pre-tax income.”\n\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\n“However, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I’m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it’s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns—sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I’ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)—maybe there’s a better way for you to invest for retirement.”\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) The Large Cap Stock Jim Cramer Can’t Stop Talking About?\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nMarket Capitalization: 1.85T\n\nJim Cramer shared his views on Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), explaining that he recently purchased more shares of the company because he felt the market was too critical of its last quarterly performance. Cramer believes Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a solid investment and expects it to continue performing well in the future.\n\n“We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Q2 2024 earnings report reveals a strong recovery, with revenue reaching $134 billion, up 11% from the previous year, and net income soaring to $6.7 billion, up from $6.75 billion from the same quarter last year. This turnaround is largely driven by a 19% increase in revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), underscoring Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s dominant position in the cloud and AI markets. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s investment in generative AI and warehouse automation supports its long-term growth prospects, especially in high-margin areas.\n\nAlthough the retail segment faces some challenges due to cautious consumer spending, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s strategic improvements in its delivery network and shopping experience are expected to enhance margins and increase market share. Analysts remain optimistic about Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s future, with expectations for continued growth in AWS and positive outlooks from major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Wedbush.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can’t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among The Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other cloud stocks.\n\nThe cloud computing market is one of the fastest growing in the technology industry as the ubiquity of the internet allows business to digitally outsource their functions to reduce investment costs and access specialized services. Estimates show that the cloud computing market was worth $480 billion in 2022, and despite its heft, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% to be worth a whopping $2.2 trillion by the end of 2032. The three segments of the cloud computing industry are infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS).\n\nREAD ALSO 13 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers and 8 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\n\nThis market, like other mega technology industries, is dominated by mega cap technology companies. As per research from Gartner, the global IaaS market is dominated by five services as of 2023 end. These are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Aliyun, and Huawei Cloud. Their market shares are 39%, 23%, 8.2%, 7.9%, and 4.3%, respectively, with all other firms commanding 17.6% of the total market. In terms of revenue, AWS raked in an impressive $54.6 billion in revenue, while the others brought in $32.1 billion, $11.4 billion, $11.1 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. AWS' dominance in the industry is clear as it brought in more than twice the revenue of all other firms that follow Huawei since their cumulative revenue was $24.6 billion.\n\nApart from the biggest players, whose valuation metrics are different due to their mature and diverse business models, valuing cloud computing stocks is different from how you'd value other companies. For instance, most firms are valued through their price to earnings (P/E) ratio. This measures the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's earnings, but the ratio becomes useless when we try it to value cloud computing stocks. This is because of the industry's obsession with growth, and its need for high margins, meaning that cloud cloud computing stocks, and particularly SaaS stocks, reinvest large portions of their revenue back into growth.\n\nSo much so that one of the most troubled SaaS companies these days has been aggressively investing in growth despite its shares being down 39.65% year to date. This firm ranks 6th on our list of Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth, with its second quarter product revenue of $868.8 million marking a 28.9% annual growth. However, this growth clearly hasn't been enough, as the stock tumbled by 14.7% after the latest earnings report. During the same period, this firm's marketing and research and development expenses sat at $838.2 million, or 96% of its revenue. This is a classic illustration of the cloud computing industry, and one that requires different valuation metrics than the P/E ratio as these firms are not profitable most of the time.\n\nThe two key metrics for valuing SaaS stocks in particular are the EV/Revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value is its market value plus net debt, and when divided by revenue, the resulting ratio measures the premium that a buyer would be willing to pay for a firm over its ability to generate revenue. The Rule of 40 is simpler, as it simply states that the sum of a SaaS firm's revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40. While this rule is simply a benchmark and not all inclusive of SaaS performance, it does have some key implications. For instance, it implies that if a firm is growing its revenue at or faster than 40%, then it can be unprofitable.\n\nOn the flip side, if growth slows down, to say 10%, then it must be highly profitable with margins of at least 30% to show that the lower growth is accompanied by the benefits of the beefy margins that software companies enjoy. McKinsey also substitutes the profit margin with the free cash flow (FCF) margin to further broaden this rule's scope. A firm's FCF simply eliminates the impact of interest, taxes, and capital expenditure on the net income. As per its analysis, the top Rule of 40 SaaS companies are investor favorites. This is because McKinsey's data shows that in a sample size of 100 SaaS companies, those with the 25 highest Rule of 40 scores had median EV/Revenue multiples of 22. This was nearly 22x the overall sample's 11x, and nearly 3x the bottom 25 firms' median EV/Revenue multiples of 8. In other words, investors are typically willing to pay a higher premium over sales for SaaS firms that have either robust revenue growth, superior cost control, or a mix of both.\n\nFinally, while EV/Revenue and Rule of 40 measure the financial validity and stature of these firms, their stock performance is also tightly linked to the economy and monetary policy. A low interest regime means that businesses can spend more money, which is beneficial for SaaS and cloud computing firms, both. On Wall Street, August has marked a paradigm shift after Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that his organization was satisfied with macroeconomic indicators to cut interest rates. This has also impacted valuations, as the median EV/Sales ratio for the top companies, i.e. Rule of 40 firms with a growth rate higher than 30%, sat at 13.3x as of the latest market close. This is the second highest for the year, with the last high being in May when it sat at 16.3x. This was before a brief rate gloom took over Wall Street in July which saw the flagship S&P index lose 8.5% between mid July and early August.\n\nAny discussion of SaaS stocks would be incomplete without a brief discussion of the implications of artificial intelligence. According to hedge fund Coatue Management, SaaS valuations as measured by forward sales are at a historic low right now through a median of 5.5x. This comes with lower growth expectations, as just 1% of SaaS firms are now seeing a median forward growth estimate of 30%+. As for the business model, SaaS firms are seeing a shift from a traditional seat based model that drove revenue from the number of users that were using the services to a consumption driven model. Their lower growth expectations are also somewhat driven by the belief that AI could allow companies to cost effectively create their own code and thereby reduce their reliance on SaaS and cloud computing providers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the holdings of First Trust's cloud ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short. Then, the stocks with the lowest percentage were selected.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q2 2024: 308\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 0.77%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology focused firm known for its strong presence in the cloud computing and the eCommerce industries. More than 80% of its revenue is from eCommerce, which means that the typical drivers of eCommerce valuation are also relevant for the company. These include reducing delivery times and growing its premium membership services. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also the world's biggest cloud computing company in terms of market share. As per Gartner, the firm controls 39% of the cloud market through its AWS business division. This introduces a high margin revenue stream for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). AWS has an operating margin of 24% as per Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s latest financial results, which is 20 percentage points higher than its North American eCommerce operations' margin of 3.8% and the overall margin of 5.7%. Through AWS and its broader technology focus, the firm is also concentrating on all three layers of the AI stack. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefits from its access to the Claude AI foundational model too, and its eCommerce market share provides it with a wide moat.\n\nPatient Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Will Outperform Nvidia by Year End",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has run circles around other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few years thanks to its leadership in the field. The company holds an 80% share of the AI chip market, and that has helped it generate triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter. As a result, the stock soared more than 2,200% over the past five years.\n\nBy comparison, its other top technology peers, including Apple and Alphabet, saw their shares rise in the double or triple digits during that period.\n\nThough I expect Nvidia to continue as a winning stock over time, from now until the end of the year another stock could step ahead. Investors have worried about Nvidia's dependence on AI revenue in an uncertain economy and the competition it faces in the chip market. In fact, Nvidia already has lost some momentum, falling 12% over the past three months.\n\nSo, investors could turn to another company that is benefiting from the AI boom but brings in billions of dollars in revenue from other businesses, too. This player might be more resilient through a difficult or uncertain economy, and my prediction is that this AI stock will outperform Nvidia by year end. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis stock is a household name\n\nThe stock I predict will beat Nvidia by year end is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Its booming e-commerce business sells essentials, general merchandise, and even various devices, books, and movies. It has become a household name, especially thanks to its Prime subscription service, with more than 200 million members.\n\nThis helped Amazon report more than $121 billion in North American and international revenue in the most recent quarter, gaining in both of these areas year over year.\n\nAnd the company might see more sign-ups for Prime in the coming weeks as it plans another Prime Big Deal Days sales event in October. With bargains exclusively for Prime members, these events are known to boost membership in the service.\n\nEven better, Amazon usually does well when it comes to retaining members. After a 30-day trial period last year, 72% of users subscribed to the service, according to Statista.\n\nRegardless of the economy, customers see value in a Prime membership because they can buy essentials for good prices and get fast and free delivery.\n\nOn top of this sure and steady revenue source, investors also benefit from growth thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, and this is where we'll find the company's AI strengths. AWS offers a broad range of cloud services, and it has gone all in on AI, selling its own lower-priced chips, premium Nvidia chips, a full-service AI platform known as Amazon Bedrock, and much more.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement says it aims to be involved in every layer of AI -- from chips to power programs to apps.\n\nAmazon's profit driver\n\nAll of this has helped AWS reach an annual revenue run rate of $105 billion this year, particularly important because AWS has traditionally been Amazon's profit driver. In the most recent quarter, AWS operating income made up 63% of the company's total.\n\nIn recent times, Nvidia's growth has topped that of Amazon and other tech companies and has wowed investors. But as sentiment becomes more cautious, investors might turn to companies such as Amazon that are involved in AI but are less dependent on it than Nvidia. Right now, both of these players are trading around the same level, at 37 times forward earnings estimates, and Amazon might seem like a safer bet for the price.\n\nThis doesn't mean Nvidia and the AI market won't deliver on their promises over the coming years; I'm confident that any short-term uncertainty in the market won't change this exciting long-term story.\n\nBut my prediction is that Nvidia, after recently losing momentum, might leave room for others to jump ahead on share price performance in the coming months. And Amazon is likely to take the lead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is There An Opportunity With Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) 48% Undervaluation?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAmazon.com's estimated fair value is US$331 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$171 suggests Amazon.com is potentially 48% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 51% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$219\n\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$71.9b US$94.9b US$113.5b US$134.0b US$149.2b US$162.2b US$173.3b US$182.9b US$191.4b US$199.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x18 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 11.37% Est @ 8.71% Est @ 6.85% Est @ 5.54% Est @ 4.63% Est @ 3.99% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8%  US$67.3k US$83.3k US$93.3k US$103.1k US$107.6k US$109.5k US$109.6k US$108.3k US$106.2k US$103.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$992b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$199b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.5%) = US$4.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.8t÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$2.5t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.5t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$171, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "title": "Do Analysts Believe That Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Is The Safest Stock to Invest In Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Starter Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\n\nThe Market Outlook for the Rest of 2024\n\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an interview on CNBC. Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\n\nThe Possible Impact of Rate Cuts on Stocks\n\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\n\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor’s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 safe stocks to invest in now, we looked for well-established companies in the energy, finance, healthcare, technology, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. These stocks have a history of performing well and boasting consistent financial results, making them ideal and safe long term investments for beginners. We then picked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by money managers and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the 10 safe stocks to invest in now. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries.\n\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also spearheading the AI transformation. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. In July, the e-commerce giant processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. The company’s investment in hardware is not recent. Its non-AI computing chip, Graviton, has been under development for almost a decade now. More recent chips by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 25% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.46 billion.\n\nAMZN is currently trading at 38 times this year’s earnings estimate and the sector forward P/E is 16. While AMZN is trading at a higher multiple, its earnings are expected to grow by 63% this year to $4.73.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st among the safe stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 37% of His $25.7 Billion Portfolio Invested in 5 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There's little question that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind the current market rally -- and with good reason. These next-generation algorithms generate original text and images, streamline processes, and automate menial and time-consuming tasks, all with a few simple keystrokes. The potential for vast increases in productivity has companies lining up to see how they can best deploy AI to benefit their respective businesses.\n\nPhilippe Laffont knows a thing or two about profiting from emerging technology. The billionaire trained under the watchful eye of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson of Tiger Global Management. Laffont heads up Coatue Management, the world's premier tech-centric hedge fund, which he founded in 1999. Since then, he's parlayed $50 million in starting capital into a financial empire with $58 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, Coatue has far outpaced the returns of the broader market, delivering annualized returns of 14% over the past three years, compared to 8% for the S&P 500.\n\nLaffont believes AI will be one of the prevailing investing themes over the coming decade, and he has his money where his mouth is: Five top AI stocks are Coatue's five largest holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Meta Platforms -- 8.2% of holdings\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is Coatue's largest AI holding -- and largest overall position, with nearly 4.2 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. Laffont trimmed the position by 3%, but gains during the second quarter left the position relatively unchanged. It isn't surprising that Meta is his largest position, given the company's long track record of using AI to its advantage. From surfacing relevant content on its social media platforms to recognizing and tagging people in photos, Meta was an early adopter of earlier branches of AI.\n\nThe company is something of an exception compared to its big tech colleagues, as Meta doesn't have a cloud infrastructure service to hawk its AI. That didn't stop the company from creating its homegrown Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama), which is available on all the major cloud services -- for a price. Advertising makes up the lion's share of Meta's revenue, so the company offers a growing suite of free-to-use AI-powered tools that help marketers on its platforms succeed, which keeps them coming back for more.\n\nImproving economic conditions are already lifting its digital advertising business. And at just 24 times forward earnings, Meta is inexpensive in light of its vast opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Amazon -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was already Laffont's second largest position, but he increased it by 7% in Q2. It now totals roughly 10.8 million shares worth nearly $2.1 billion. The e-commerce and cloud giant also has a long history of deploying AI. Amazon uses AI to surface relevant products for its online shoppers, recommend programming choices to its Prime Video and Music audience, determine the most efficient delivery routes for its e-commerce shipments, and plan inventory levels at its warehouses, among other uses. More recently, Amazon released generative AI tools to answer shoppers' questions and help sellers create compelling product descriptions.\n\nLet's not forget Amazon Web Services (AWS), which launched Bedrock AI to offer the most popular generative AI models to its cloud customers. The company also created AI-specific chips -- dubbed Inferentia and Trainium -- to accelerate AI processing on AWS.\n\nThe improving economic conditions are expected to be a boon to Amazon, and AI will no doubt play a part in its success. And at less than 3 times sales, the price is right.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- 7.7% of holdings\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is the \"world's largest and best semiconductor foundry,\" according to the company. Since state-of-the-art chips are the heart of AI processing, it isn't surprising that TSMC is Laffont's third-largest position. He added more than 1 million shares in the second quarter, increasing his holdings by 10%. Coatue's position now amounts to 11.4 million shares, collectively worth roughly $2 billion.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has increased demand for the world's most advanced processors. TSMC dominates the semiconductor foundry space, with an estimated 62% of the market. More importantly, the company manufactures roughly 92% of the world's most advanced chips -- including most of the processors used for AI.\n\nGiven TSMC's pivotal role in the industry and the widespread belief that the AI revolution is still in its early stages, the next few years should provide a windfall for the company -- and its shareholders. And at just 25 times forward earnings, TSMC is still reasonably priced.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Nvidia -- 6.6% of holdings\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may well be the standard bearer for the AI revolution, so it's only natural it would figure prominently in Laffont's portfolio. Coatue trimmed its position by less than 1% during the second quarter, but the value of its holdings increased, thanks to 37% gains for Nvidia stock. Laffont now owns roughly 13.8 million shares worth $1.7 billion.\n\nThe company's cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) are already the gold standard for AI processing in data centers and cloud computing, having previously been the go-to for machine learning,  an earlier branch of AI. Even with an estimated 90% market share, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels and has accelerated its product release schedule to a one-year cadence. This dramatic increase in the pace of its chip development will make it even tougher for rivals to compete.\n\nThe triple-digit year-over-year growth Nvidia has delivered for five consecutive quarters is expected to decelerate this year but remain high by historical standards. Despite dominating the AI chip market, Nvidia stock is reasonably priced, with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 5: Microsoft -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was quick to enter the AI revolution, integrating AI across a broad cross-section of its products and services and offering a growing suite of AI models on its Azure Cloud platform. That's probably why it's Laffont's fifth-largest holding, one he increased by nearly 21,000 shares in Q2. The position now amounts to 3.7 million shares worth nearly $1.7 billion.\n\nHowever, the company's biggest coup was likely the release of Copilot, its productivity-enhancing suite of AI-powered assistants. While Microsoft doesn't yet break out its results, some on Wall Street believe that Copilot -- and, more broadly, AI -- could generate as much as $100 billion in incremental revenue by 2027. It's also having an impact now, as Microsoft's proliferation of AI services is having a halo effect on its Azure Cloud, contributing 8 percentage points of growth in its most recent quarter.\n\nThe stock is selling for 31 times forward earnings which is an attractive price given Microsoft's growth potential. META Chart\n\nAll long-term winners\n\nEach of these stocks is well known for dominating their respective industries, but it's their performance since the AI revolution kicked off early last year that really stands out. As you can see from the chart above, every one of Laffont's five top holdings have outperformed the S&P 500, and most by a wide margin.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually in the coming years, according to estimates compiled by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Some estimates are much higher. Given their pivotal positions in the emerging AI industry, each of these stocks is worth a look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Slumped on Friday",
        "content": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's all about the economy\n\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\n\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\n\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\n\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\n\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote –- that a recession could still occur.\n\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI opportunity\n\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\n\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\n\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\n\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards. Meta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms. Tesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity.

        "content": "Semiconductor ETFs Take A Beating, Dragged Lower By Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom Stocks\n\nSemiconductor, hardware, and artificial intelligence-linked stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are down as the sector continues to pull back.\n\nAI stocks led by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) selloff continue their downward price trajectory as the Nvidia and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) quarterly prints failed to impress the Street.\n\nBroadcom released its third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The topline grew 42% to  $13.07 billion in the third quarter, topping the analyst estimate of $12.96 billion. The chipmaker expects fourth-quarter revenue of $14 billion, above the analyst consensus of $12.70 billion. The adjusted gross margin grew by 110 bps sequentially and 230 bps year-on-year to 77.4%.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur projected upside, citing robust AI growth, VMware momentum, and recovery in traditional semiconductor sectors.\n\nLast week, Nvidia’s second-quarter topline grew 122% to $30.04 billion, surpassing the analyst estimate of $28.68 billion. It expects third-quarter revenue of $31.85 billion-$33.15 billion versus the analyst consensus of $31.77 billion. The adjusted gross margin declined 320 bps sequentially and grew by 450 bps year-on-year.\n\nBofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya maintained a bullish outlook backed by data center and AI training demand and supply chain recovery.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which tracks the overall performance of the 25 largest U.S.-listed companies that produce semiconductors, including Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and AMD, has been down 12% in the last five days. iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell 12% in the previous five days.\n\nNvidia has been down 15% in the last five days. AMD lost over 10%, and Taiwan Semiconductor lost 8%.

        "content": "Friday, September 6, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Roche Holding AG (RHHBY) and GE Aerospace (GE), as well as two micro-cap stocks Canterbury Park Holding Corporation (CPHC) and NVE Corporation (NVEC). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAmazon.com shares have lost ground lately, along with the rest of its Magnificent 7 peers and other megacap Tech operators, but they have still been strong performers this year (up +13.7% vs. +15.3% for the S&P 500 index. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nAmazon.com’s expanding global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses, remain a plus. Growing adoption of AWS is aiding Amazon’s cloud dominance. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\r\n\r\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Amazon issued weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance due to the changing shopping pattern of consumers, which is a negative.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Roche have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months (+22.0% vs. +4.1%). Th company’s performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2024 was impressive because of the high demand for its drugs and tests.\r\n\r\nThe second quarter saw an acceleration in growth as total sales were no longer affected by the decline in COVID-19 sales, resulting in very strong sales growth. Consequently, Roche raised its earnings outlook for the full year. Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Evrysdi and Polivy boost growth. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Roche is also looking to diversify and make inroads in the lucrative obesity market in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs due to competition from biosimilars.  The company’s efforts to develop new drugs are encouraging. The base diagnostics business is also performing well.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of GE Aerospace have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry over the past six months (+25.1% vs. +7.7%). The company has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies.\r\n\r\nRising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. GE Aerospace remains committed to making investments to boost growth and provide better services to its customers.\r\n\r\nIts portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. For 2024, it expects organic revenues to grow in the high-single-digit range from the year-ago level. However, it has been dealing with high costs and expenses related to projects and restructuring activities.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on GE here >>>)\r\n\r\nCanterbury Park’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the year-to-date period (-0.6% vs. +6.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $100.78 million offers significant long-term revenue potential through diversified projects like an amphitheater, Winners Circle and residential units, driving growth beyond traditional gaming.\r\n\r\nFinancially stable with $24 million in cash and short-term investments, Canterbury Park can fund growth without debt. Improved EBITDA margins and diversified revenue streams, including pari-mutuel wagering and event hosting, support CPHC’s earnings stability. The company’s vision of a regional destination is progressing, with leasing success indicating solid demand.\r\n\r\nHowever, risks include a 93.6% drop in second-quarter 2024 net income due to a non-recurring gain in 2023, weak casino revenues and substantial losses from equity investments. Increased competition from nearby casinos could impact market share and profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Canterbury Park here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NVE have gained +0.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s gain of +16.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $367.89 million exhibits strong margins in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, with gross margin rising to 86% and operating margin at 65%, driven by a profitable product mix and direct sales.\r\n\r\nThe company's increased R&D spending by 26%, especially in wafer-level chip scale packaging aimed at medical and industrial applications, expected to drive new revenue streams. Despite a 24% sales decline due to semiconductor downturns, strong cash flows and a $53 million cash reserve support a steady $1.00 per share dividend. NVE Corporation's focus on spintronic technologies positions it well in high-growth sectors.\r\n\r\nHowever, revenue risks persist with heavy reliance on key customers and competitive pressures. Rising operating expenses and labor market challenges may pressure near-term profitability, while supply-chain vulnerabilities and inventory management issues could impact operational efficiency.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include IQVIA Holdings Inc. (IQV), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Would a gen AI-powered Alexa return real profits for Amazon?",
        "content": "Ten years ago this November, Amazon released a breakthrough device with an understated tweet.\n\n“Introducing Amazon Echo,” it read. “Always ready, connected, and fast. Just ask.”\n\nBuried within the subsequent announcement was the introduction of Alexa, too, which quickly captured the minds of consumers young and old on its way to becoming a cultural phenomenon. Coming on the heels of Amazon’s Fire phone flop, the release felt even more astonishing.\n\nFor a period of time in my household, Alexa felt like magic. Sure, we queried it for weather updates and asked it to serve as a timer during cooking. But it was the ability for our young kids to start a post-meal dance party by uttering just a few words that, looking back, my wife and I remember the most fondly. No, the speaker didn’t have the greatest sound. But it was more than passable and the moments it helped create for our family were delightful.\n\nThe problem for Amazon, eventually, was that our usage of Alexa never translated into real incremental revenue or profit for the company once the Echo was in our house. We didn’t shop from the company any more than we did before and slowly stopped engaging overall as much as we once did. Over time, Alexa started to sound more desperate, too, offering us suggestions we had no interest in after an answer to our actual query was given. Along the way, Amazon was still spending billions with no real return in sight.\n\nThen, ChatGPT and the generative AI boom happened, and Alexa was caught flat-footed as my colleague Sharon Goldman reported in depth. Now, a gen AI-powered version of Alexa could be announced as early as this month, but it is expected to come with a monthly fee. Yes, Amazon has half a billion Alexa-powered devices out in the world, but it may be an uphill battle to convert enough existing users to a paid version years after the popularity of the original Alexa peaked.\n\nIf unsuccessful, it’s fair to wonder how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy would react. He hasn’t been afraid to course-correct and cost-cut aggressively in his three years as chief executive. He could decide that Amazon’s AWS cloud business, with its multiple positions in the AI land grab, is enough.\n\nThen again, a 500-million device footprint is massive and Amazon has pleasantly surprised the masses and the media before, as the early years of Alexa proved. Can they do it again?\n\nMore news below.\n\nJason Del Rey\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Herbalife and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – September 6, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses CVS Health CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, Herbalife Ltd HLF and Amazon's AMZN.\n\nIndustry: Pharmacies and Drug Stores\n\nLink:https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2332143/3-stocks-to-avoid-from-the-volatile-retail-pharmacy-industry\n\nThe majority of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of rising expenses and labor shortages. Consumers have limited money to spend, which is leading to a decline in retail pharmacy products. Added to this, the entire retail pharmacy industry is currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. Unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are acting as a huge burden on this sector, putting substantial pressure on the companies.\n\nCVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Herbalife Ltd are three stocks that have been negatively impacted by the industry-wide trends. Also, Amazon's dominance in the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue for the existing entities.\n\nOn a positive note, in the middle of the ongoing trend of digitalization within the healthcare product supply side, there has been a significant shift toward digital consumption of healthcare products and services as well. Amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is witnessing growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care.\n\nFurther, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers.\n\nOver the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\nStory continues\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices stemming from the rising cost of raw materials.\n\nThe industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. Going by a National Association of Chain Drugs report, payors are substantially shrinking reimbursement, many times below the cost of buying and dispensing prescription drugs. This is putting substantial and unsustainable financial pressure on the companies to the extent that many of the industry players over the past year were seen shutting down their businesses, reducing the number of stores or going private.\n\nAmazon Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy's omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report of 2023, Amazon's omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market.\n\nIn June 2024, the company announced that Prime's RxPass subscription savings program is gaining popularity by providing an exclusive benefit to Prime members that enables affordable access to common medications. In 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately.\n\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market. With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon's emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even now, when the pandemic is over, pharmacy retailers have been witnessing growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies.\n\nThe digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments. Further, with the digitalization of drug stores, easy online purchases of medicines have gained popularity.\n\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #249, placing it in the bottom 1% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 22.7% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector's growth of 18.6%. The S&P 500 composite has risen 22.6% over the said time frame.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.45X compared with the S&P 500's 21.17X and the sector's 22.38X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X.\n\n3 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks to Avoid\n\nCVS Health, within the Health Care Benefits segment, has been grappling with a sudden increase in Medicare Advantage members' utilization trend, where an increasing number of members are opting for health benefits. This significantly impacted the company's second-quarter 2024 performance. CVS Health is particularly facing outpatient and supplemental benefits pressure.\n\nAdded to this, the company is also witnessing pressure from inpatient categories, RSV vaccines and other pharmacy benefits. This has resulted in a significant rise in the company's medical costs, putting pressure on margins. The downward revision in the 2024 earnings outlook looks worrisome.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings indicates a 25.4% plunge from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), delivered a trailing four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 2.02%.\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. Like the company's industry peers, Herbalife too is grappling with issues of U.S. retail pharmacy. Increased reimbursement pressure and drug cost inflation have been denting the company's margins.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues indicates a 1.8% dip from the 2023 reported figure. The 2024 earnings estimate projects a 59.3% decline from the year-ago period. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #4 at present.\n\nOver the past few quarters, Walgreens Boots has faced significant challenges within the company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy business stemming from an unfavorable consumer environment and challenging pharmacy industry trends. The company, in this regard, noted that customers have become increasingly selective and price-sensitive in their purchases. Despite several planned measures being taken, the company does not expect an immediate improvement within the U.S. retail business as the operating environment might continue to remain challenging.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 earnings indicate a decline of 27.9% and 29.8% decline from the respective year-ago figures. Walgreens Boots presently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)’s Ad Platform, Combined With Its Extensive Customer Data, Makes It A Compelling Choice For Advertisers’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\n\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn’t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let’s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don’t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\n\nSo, can I just take a moment to speak some words that we all believe but very rarely get to say in polite conversation? Look, money's important. It's really important. And caring about the state of your finances does not make you seem like some sort of superficial bourgeois monster. Say you’ve got a lousy credit score and you want to get married—congratulations, you've just inflicted your horrible credit on your new spouse. Now neither you nor your partner will be able to qualify to buy a car or a home or perhaps even just get a darn credit card.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\n\nSo let me answer one of the most important questions out there: What the heck should young people do with their money? First, foremost, and always, you need to invest. That's the only way you're going to be able to achieve financial freedom. And by freedom, I mean living a life where you're not totally dependent on the next paycheck. Teaching you how to do this is one of the reasons I actually put so much time and energy into creating the CNBC Investing Club. I'm always thrilled when I see younger members taking an active hand in managing their own money.\"\n\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they’re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\n\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it’s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\n\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\n\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\n\"Here’s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nJMP Securities has raised its price target for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), thanks to positive expectations about its advertising business. Analysts believe that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s ad platform, combined with its extensive customer data, makes it a compelling choice for advertisers, potentially drawing more marketing dollars compared to its competitors. Jim Cramer points out that this boost in the price target reflects confidence in Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s ability to leverage its advertising strengths effectively.\n\n\"Amazon landed a price-target bump at JMP Securities, rooted in analysts’ optimism about its advertising business. Amazon’s integrated ad platform combined with its trove of customer data is an attractive pairing that should attract more marketing dollars relative to peers, analysts argued.\"\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has shown a strong recovery in its Q2 2024 earnings report. Revenue reached $134 billion, marking an 11% increase from the previous year, while net income surged to $6.7 billion, a turnaround from a $2 billion loss in the same quarter of 2022. This improvement is largely attributed to a 19% rise in revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), highlighting Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s leading role in the cloud and AI markets.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s investments in generative AI and warehouse automation are expected to support long-term growth, particularly in high-margin sectors. Despite some challenges in retail due to cautious consumer spending, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making strategic enhancements to its delivery network and shopping experience. These efforts are likely to improve profit margins and boost market share. Analysts are optimistic about Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s future, anticipating continued growth in AWS and favorable outlooks from major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Wedbush.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Dow Jones Stocks Billionaires Are Buying",
        "content": "Following the stock picks of billionaires can help any investor become more informed about the markets and what stocks might be worth closer consideration. Billionaire investors tend to focus on relatively safe companies that can grow and preserve wealth, and they can afford to conduct thorough research into the companies they invest in. They have shown a propensity for avoiding companies that have peaked and/or are losing their competitive edge.\n\nBillionaires Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and Daniel Loeb of Third Point currently hold large stakes in two tech stocks that are among the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Halvorsen has had a very successful career as a professional investment manager. His net worth is estimated at $7 billion, according to Forbes. Loeb has an estimated net worth of $3 billion, according to the same source.\n\nViking Global bought more shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the second quarter, while Third Point started a position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Here's why these two Dow stocks getting added billionaire attention are smart buys right now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nCoincidentally, Amazon is the largest holding for both Viking Global and Third Point. Despite the stock's sharp rebound since bottoming out in 2022, Viking Global bought more shares in the second quarter, suggesting the stock still offers attractive potential.\n\nAmazon saw accelerating growth in its market-leading cloud computing business this year. Management is also working to improve margins on the retail side. Operating profit grew 91% year over year last quarter. The growing profits provide more resources to pursue opportunities to strengthen its e-commerce business, its largest revenue source.\n\nAmazon is currently laying the groundwork to launch a satellite internet service, a market expected to grow 13% per year through 2030, according to Grand View Research. The company's new broadband service, Project Kuiper, is going after up to 500 million households that don't have broadband connectivity. It could be Amazon's next multibillion-dollar revenue stream.\n\nThese investments are ultimately widening the company's economic moat by creating a stickier service for customers to find what they need. It explains why the stock is the top holding for these billionaires, and why Amazon should be worth a lot more in 10 years than it is today.\n\n2. Apple\n\nOne of Third Point's new positions in the second quarter was Apple. Like Amazon, it benefits from a strong brand name. The smartphone market is very competitive, but the iPhone still brought in trailing-12-month revenue of $198 billion, roughly half of Apple's business.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrand Finance ranked the company as the top brand in the world in its annual Global Top 500 2024 report. Apple has been very successful in recent years at building a sticky ecosystem of apps and services that work together across the company's devices, which is why customers tend to pay a premium for its products.\n\nApple controls only less than 20% of global smartphone unit sales, so it has a lot of opportunity to convert more users over the long term. Management continues to invest in opening more retail stores (it just opened its first location in Malaysia).\n\nIts active installed base of devices grew to new highs in every geographic segment last quarter, which suggests there is still great potential for the brand worldwide.\n\nThe launch of new artificial intelligence (AI) features will go a long way to stimulating more demand for iPhone upgrades over the next few years. An increasing installed base should lead to more profitable growth that fuels returns for Apple investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn’t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let’s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don’t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\n\nSo, can I just take a moment to speak some words that we all believe but very rarely get to say in polite conversation? Look, money's important. It's really important. And caring about the state of your finances does not make you seem like some sort of superficial bourgeois monster. Say you’ve got a lousy credit score and you want to get married—congratulations, you've just inflicted your horrible credit on your new spouse. Now neither you nor your partner will be able to qualify to buy a car or a home or perhaps even just get a darn credit card.\"\n\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\n\nSo let me answer one of the most important questions out there: What the heck should young people do with their money? First, foremost, and always, you need to invest. That's the only way you're going to be able to achieve financial freedom. And by freedom, I mean living a life where you're not totally dependent on the next paycheck. Teaching you how to do this is one of the reasons I actually put so much time and energy into creating the CNBC Investing Club. I'm always thrilled when I see younger members taking an active hand in managing their own money.\"\n\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they’re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\n\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it’s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\n\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\n\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\n\"Here’s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) the Number One EV Stock Across the Globe?\n\nA state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall.\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nJim Cramer believes Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a strong long-term investment because its products are impressive. While having a well-funded partner is a positive sign for Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s stability, Cramer advises that this doesn’t automatically mean you should buy the company right now. Instead, he suggests holding onto it rather than selling, as Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s continued presence in the market is a key factor to consider.\n\n\" I think Rivian is a great long-term stock. Why? Because the actual product is so fabulous that the last thing I want to do is write these guys off. Now that they have a deep-pocketed partner, does that mean you should own the stock? No. It means that you shouldn't sell the stock necessarily, but it means the company's sticking around, and that's what really matters.\"\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a promising investment due to its successful launch of the R1T electric pickup truck and R1S electric SUV, which have been well-received for their performance and unique features. These vehicles, designed for adventure and outdoor use, give Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) a strong position in the EV market. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) benefits from strategic partnerships, including a significant deal with\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMZN) for 100,000 electric delivery vans and an investment from\n\nFord Motor Company\n\n(NYSE:F). These partnerships strengthen Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s market position and financial stability.\n\nAdditionally, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is expanding production with its facility in Normal, Illinois, and plans to build a second U.S. factory to meet high demand and boost revenue. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s early entry into the electric pickup and SUV markets provides a competitive advantage as the global shift toward electric vehicles grows.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a US-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, namely the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. They also have exposure to the commercial vehicle market with their electric delivery vans (EDVs) that are sold to companies like Amazon. The company has faced challenges amid the broader slowdown in electric vehicle demand and rising interest rates.\n\nThis has contributed to Rivian underperforming expectations over the past few quarters. Rivian has also incurred losses as it continues to invest in the development of its products and manufacturing capabilities. We own Rivian in a hedged structure, which provides a significant margin of safety. Despite the near[1]term challenges, several factors provide optimism that Rivian can emerge as a long-term winner in the EV market. Rivian’s balance sheet is strong, with a substantial cash position that enables the company to continue investing in its growth and navigate through the current economic headwinds.\n\nRivian is also unveiling the R2, which is a smaller and more affordable EV platform that will open the company’s products to a wider customer base. Lastly, Rivian’s investment in the enhancement of its production capabilities should improve the company’s manufacturing efficiency and drive a path to profitability. We continue to hold the company in a hedged structure.”\n\nOverall RIVN ranks 8th on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.  Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\n\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Even as the company increases capital expenditures related to AI, it continues to deliver on a range of financial metrics in earnings, soothing investor concerns around ROI. The firm reported over $100 billion in operating income in the second quarter, with operating margin reaching nearly 10%. The revenue of the firm during this time was almost $150 billion, with nearly 19% growth in Amazon Web Services. AWS contributed almost 70% to the operating income. The business model of the firm, with large stakes in the retail, cloud, and advertising markets, will likely deliver 10% annual top line growth for the next three years.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. JMP Securities recently raised the price target on the stock to $265 from $245 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares, underlining that higher-than-consensus advertising estimates released by the firm seemed reasonable given the vertically integrated full-stack advertising platform, which can serve upper funnel down to lower funnel advertising solutions.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says\n\nDespite the significant growth and investor interest in artificial intelligence stocks, Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday the sector is not in a speculative bubble, unlike previous technology booms such as the late 1990s internet bubble.\n\nYet the analysts highlight the importance of diversification given the high concentration risk among leading tech companies, often referred to as the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe extraordinary performance of tech stocks in recent years has been justified by their earnings, said Goldman stategist Peter Oppenheimer.\n\nGlobal tech earnings per share have risen by approximately 400% since the global financial crisis, while non-tech sectors achieved a comparatively modest 25% increase, he said.\n\n“The technology sector is not in a bubble and is likely to continue to dominate returns,” Oppenheimer said.\n\nTech Valuations Remain Reasonable: Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs highlights a key difference between the AI-driven rally and previous market bubbles.\n\nThe valuations of major tech players are significantly lower than those of tech stocks during past speculative phases.\n\nFor instance, while the Magnificent Seven — Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) — account for over 30% of the S&P 500's market weight (compared to 19% for tech giants in the 2000s), they trade at nearly half the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seen in the prior dot-com bubble.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($bn) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Apple 7.3 3,387 26.5 7.7 Microsoft 6.6 3,043 25.7 9.4 NVIDIA 5.7 2,649 24.1 13.2 Amazon 4.0 1,850 25.4 2.5 Alphabet 3.9 1,808 16.6 2.0 Meta Platforms 2.4 1,118 19.2 5.5 Tesla 1.4 672 55.4 4.9 Magnificent 7 31.3 14,527 23.9 5.0\n\nIn contrast, tech giants during the 2000s dot-com bubble were trading at much higher multiples. Cisco Systems, for example, had a forward P/E of 101.7, while Intel‘s was 42.1, significantly inflating their valuations relative to the broader market.\n\nCompany S&P 500 Weight (%) Market Cap ($B) Forward P/E R&D (% of Revenue) Microsoft 4.5 581 53.2 19.2 Cisco Systems 4.2 543 101.7 17.5 Intel 3.6 465 42.1 N/A Oracle 1.9 245 84.6 N/A IBM 1.7 218 23.5 28 Lucent Technologies 1.6 206 37.9 N/A Nortel Networks 1.5 199 86.4 N/A 2000 Bubble Leaders 19.0 2,457 52.0 N/A\n\nDiversification: Key To Reduce Major Volatility Events\n\nThe Goldman Sachs equity team is flagging the concentration risks that come with this tech dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a few stocks dominate market returns, the potential for “stock-specific mistakes” increases, exposing the broader market to severe corrections, Oppenheimer said. For instance, before the July market correction, the Magnificent Seven stocks were responsible for about 50% of the S&P 500's total returns for the year.\n\n“A market that becomes dominated by a few stocks becomes increasingly vulnerable to either disruption or anti-trust regulation,” he said.\n\nA risk also exists that heightened competition and new entrants into the AI space could compress margins and slow growth for the market leaders.\n\nGoldman Sachs recommends seeking opportunities beyond the tech behemoths, particularly in smaller tech companies and sectors tied to infrastructure spending, which may benefit from AI advancements.\n\nThe growth of infrastructure capex could boost old-economy industries that incorporate AI technologies into their operations, the firm said.\n\nRead Next:\n\nS&P 500 Earnings Could Face Major Swings Under Harris Or Trump Tax Plans, Goldman Sachs Warns\n\nPhoto via Unsplash.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article AI Tech Sector 'Is Not In A Bubble,' But Diversification Out Of Magnificent 7 Is Key, Goldman Sachs Says originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com sued a U.S. labor board on Thursday, accusing it of illegally interfering in a union election at a New York City warehouse and claiming the agency's structure violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in San Antonio, Texas, federal court seeks to block the National Labor Relations Board from deciding a case that could force Amazon to bargain with the union, which won a 2022 election at the warehouse in Staten Island.\n\nThe labor board last week upheld the results of the election, rejecting Amazon's claims that it was tainted by demonstrations held by workers and union organizers and that board officials who oversaw the voting were biased toward the union.\n\nAmazon's lawsuit says the board's in-house enforcement proceedings violate the constitutional separation of powers and the company's right to a jury trial.\n\nNearly 20 other companies including rocket maker SpaceX, Starbucks and Trader Joe's have made similar claims against the board in pending lawsuits and administrative cases.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An NLRB spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe election at the Amazon warehouse known as JFK8 was the first and so far only successful union campaign in the company's history.\n\nWorkers at two other Amazon warehouses in New York and one in Alabama have since voted against joining the Amazon Labor Union, which recently affiliated itself with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n\nThe NLRB issued scores of complaints accusing Amazon of illegal union-busting tactics during those campaigns, including firing union supporters, making threats, holding mandatory anti-union meetings, and refusing to bargain with the Staten Island union. Amazon has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThat included a rare lawsuit the board filed in New York federal court on the eve of the Staten Island election accusing Amazon of illegally firing a pro-union worker. In Thursday's lawsuit, Amazon claims that the labor board \"interfered with the free and fair choice of the employee voters\" by suing the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's lawsuit also alleges that the NLRB's five members, who are appointed by the president, are improperly shielded from being removed at will, and that the board's unique structure where it serves as a prosecutor, judge, and jury in certain cases violates the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, has said the claims about the board's structure lack merit and that companies challenging the agency are attempting to distract from their violations of workers' labor rights.\n\nIn July, two federal judges in Texas issued separate rulings temporarily blocking NLRB cases against SpaceX and pipeline operator Energy Transfer. The judges said the companies were likely to prevail on claims that board members and administrative judges are improperly insulated from removal.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Richard Chang, Alexia Garamfalvi and Diane Craft)",

        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Thursday, adding as much as 3.8%. As of 3:05 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.8%.\n\nThere were a pair of catalysts that sent the cloud computing leader higher. The company got a little love from Wall Street and Amazon Web Services (AWS) got a prestigious new client.\n\nStrong and growing momentum\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan initiated Amazon stock with an overweight (buy) rating while assigning a price target of $230. For those keeping score at home, that represents potential upside of 33% compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst cited opportunities in both online retail and AWS. Mathivanan believes Amazon has room to expand its retail margins, which will boost profits. He also suggests that AWS growth will continue to accelerate.\n\nThe analyst notes Amazon's \"dominant competitive position in two large consumer and software end-markets with its retail and cloud businesses provides a lot to be bullish about over the next 12-18 months.\"\n\nThe second catalyst was the announcement that Central Japan Railway Company had selected AWS to advance its operations. The high-speed railway provides services to 170 million passengers each year. The company will tap AWS' Internet of Things, machine learning, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to help make data-driven decisions, improve operational efficiencies, and lower maintenance costs.\n\nMultiple opportunities\n\nBy acquiring an important new client, Amazon seemed to punctuate the analyst's point about the acceleration of AWS and he's clearly done his research. In the second quarter, AWS increased sales by 19%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon has no equal in the realm of digital retail, generating sales of nearly $122 billion in Q2. Even a small improvement in the company's margins will result in a big increase in profits.\n\nFinally, at roughly 3 times sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly in light of the multiple opportunities for growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): An AI Stock You Should Not Have Missed",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\n\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Latest reports reveal that Amazon will power the latest updates to Alexa, the virtual assistant it has been marketing for years, with the AI model of Anthropic, a California-based AI startup. The reports indirectly reveal the failure of in-house AI models at Amazon, with some sources that spoke to news agency Reuters claiming that the in-house AI models of Amazon have lag times of six or seven seconds and problems with consistency and accuracy. The tech giant will charge $5 or $10 per month for advanced AI features in Alexa.\n\nFollowing the latest earnings release, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) earned an Overweight rating at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $210. In an investor note, the advisory highlighted that the mix shift toward lower average selling price and lower margin items, combined with a slower than expected ramp in high-margin advertising and cost to serve improvements, was weighing on profits of the tech giant more than expected.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Can Cloud Momentum Drive Amazon's Stock Beyond Its 14.1% YTD Gain?",
        "content": "Buoyed by cloud dominance, Amazon AMZN shares have gained 14.1% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s return of 11.2%. The company is also outperforming two other major cloud behemoths — Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google, which have returned 8.7% and 12%, respectively, in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nIn second-quarter 2024, AMZN’s cloud-computing arm — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — generated revenues of $26.3 billion (18% of net sales), which rose 19% year over year.\r\n\r\nPer Canalys data, AWS accounted for 33% of the total cloud spending in the same quarter, while Microsoft and Google accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAmazon has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant strides in strengthening its Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities. This, in turn, is strengthening its cloud-computing solutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the AMZN stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index’s rally of 15.9% year to date. Although Amazon is considered the e-commerce giant due to its solid Prime momentum Prime, growing relationships with third-party sellers and strong online store offerings, foreign exchange headwinds and changing consumer spending patterns are concerning for the company’s online retail business.\r\n\r\nGiven these hurdles in the e-commerce space, the most crucial question is whether Amazon's cloud momentum will drive the stock.\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAWS Portfolio Strength: A Key Catalyst for AMZN Stock\n\nAWS’s concerted efforts toward strengthening service offerings remain crucial in sustaining its dominance in the booming cloud market.\r\n\r\nIt recently unveiled a GenAI-powered service called AWS App Studio, which helps create enterprise-grade applications by leveraging natural language. It simplifies and fastens the process of developing an application from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe company announced the general availability of its new managed service called AWS Parallel Computing Service, which enables customers to build scientific and engineering models and seamlessly manage high-performance computing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIts introduction of AWS Graviton4-based compute instances, which offer up to 30% better price performance than the industry-leading AWS Graviton3 instances, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAWS’s deepening focus on innovating Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the GenAI space, is a major positive. The unveiling of Bedrock features like custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to provide customers a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced GenAI applications, is a plus.\r\n\r\nThe company’s GenAI offerings include a smart assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.\r\n\r\nApart from robust cloud solutions, Amazon’s expanding network of infrastructure regions is another positive. It recently launched AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region. With this move, AWS now has 108 Availability Zones across 34 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS’s Strong Clientele Drives Amazon’s Growth\n\nStrong GenAI capabilities, coupled with AWS’s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of infrastructure regions and Availability Zones, are bolstering its customer base.\r\n\r\nRecently, AWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS's Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.\r\n\r\nA global gold producer named Gold Fields shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS’s analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAccenture ACN joined forces with AWS to develop the Accenture Responsible Artificial Intelligence platform. Accenture leverages AWS’s AI services, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker, along with AWS Control Tower, Amazon DataZone and AWS observability tools.\r\n\r\nInfor, a leading provider of a global leader in business cloud software, recently selected Amazon Bedrock to deploy GenAI solutions embedded within Infor CloudSuite.\r\n\r\nAWS was picked by Iberdrola and PolyAI as their preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nRobin AI teamed up with AWS to power its legal assistant by using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker.\r\n\r\nGE HealthCare GEHC selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider to accelerate healthcare transformation with GenAI. GEHC intends to utilize AWS’s ML and GenAI capabilities for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration of Exscientia with AWS remains noteworthy. The former is expanding the use of AWS’s AI and ML services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost.\n\nAMZN’s Rising Estimates Paint Bright Picture\n\nAWS’s expanding customer base on the back of solid portfolio strength is expected to aid its long-term prospects.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.49 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 63.5%. The estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon Faces Challenges & Offers Lofty Valuation\n\nAlthough Amazon's cloud prospects and AI initiatives are positives, broader market concerns, macroeconomic uncertainties, geo-political tensions and intensifying cloud competition are major concerns, which make its near-term prospects foggy.\r\n\r\nThe looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to the AMZN stock’s AI-driven growth prospects.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the hurdles Amazon is facing in its e-commerce business do not bode well.\r\n\r\nAMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 2.67X compared with the industry’s 1.73X, reflecting a stretched valuation at this moment. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon’s solid AWS momentum and rising earnings estimates present a compelling investment opportunity.\r\n\r\nMacro headwinds surrounding the company’s prospects, along with challenges of changing consumer spending patterns in its online retail business, which contributes the most to its total revenues, are concerning.\r\n\r\nHence, investors should be mindful of these challenges. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Amazon.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "This NFL season is about to show how fast the sports TV landscape is changing",
        "content": "It was only three years ago the NFL signed a media rights deal that welcomed Amazon Prime Video (AMZN) into the fold as the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAt the time, the $13 billion, 11-year deal was viewed as a disruptive force that would forever alter the state of television and the status quo of sports media rights.\n\nBut more than any other major league, the NFL loves television and its wide distribution. Case in point: Within its new media rights deal was news the NFL would return to Disney's (DIS) ABC network on Monday nights, with the network also airing the Super Bowl in 2027 and 2031, ending what will be a 21-year absence.\n\nThe league also kept its primary packages in place with CBS (PARA), Fox (FOXA), and NBC (CMCSA). Moreover, the Amazon games are still broadcast over the air for free on local networks.\n\n\"The model for us, today at least, is we want to be on linear and digital,\" Hans Schroeder, executive vice president and COO of NFL Media, told Yahoo Finance. \"Streaming is clearly continuing to grow, and I think that'll be a bigger and bigger part of our future as we look forward.\"\n\n\"But to us, it's not an 'either-or' ... Pay TV is under a tremendous amount of pressure, but we've always been more tethered to broadcast and free to air.\"\n\nHistorically, the NFL has been careful not to place too much of itself and its games behind a paywall.\n\nYet, in the last two seasons, that strategy has begun to shift in what the league describes as \"the next step\" of its product.\n\nNetflix (NFLX), which previously said it wasn't interested in the business of live sports, inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air Christmas Day games. The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSimilarly, Peacock will host one exclusive in-season game — a Friday night game in Brazil on the season's first weekend — after it aired an exclusive Wild Card playoff game last season. The platform, which paid a reported $110 million for the rights to the playoff game, saw a significant lift in subscribers as a result.\n\nGoogle's YouTube TV (GOOG, GOOGL) now holds the exclusive rights to NFL Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide.\n\n\"You have to meet consumers where they are,\" Anthony Palomba, professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told Yahoo Finance. \"That is something that I think up until recently has been lost on all of the major CEOs of media companies. You can't keep doing what's familiar.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSchroeder said the shift to more digital-first, streaming partners is one that \"feels less revolutionary this year\" and \"more like the next step in the evolution.\"\n\n\"For us, it all starts with wanting wide, broad reach of our games,\" he said. \"That's why 85% [of our games] are on broadcast television. It's really a smaller part that aren't. All games are on broadcast in their home markets.\"\n\n\"But we also need to be smart. We know our fans are increasingly spending their time on other screens, other platforms, and we need to be on those platforms too.\"\n\n'A mutually beneficial relationship'\n\nAs the media landscape has changed and consumers turn away from cable bundles more and more, sports sometimes feels like the only thing left to watch on TV.\n\nAnd when it comes to sports on TV, the biggest audiences aggregate in one place: NFL football. NFL games on TV accounted for 93 of the 100 highest-rated shows on TV in 2023. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes fires up the crowd before the first half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions, Saturday, Aug. 17, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"We were a big part of the growth of broadcast TV,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter last year.\n\n\"It was a mutually beneficial relationship. We reached a much broader audience, and it helped them develop to the point where we even developed a fourth network with Fox in the early ’90s. And that wasn’t just a sports network, that was a network.\"\n\n\"Now it’s streaming, and I think a large part of that is advertising and subscription and dual revenue streams, and that’s the case here,\" he said.\n\nSome experts see the recent move to carve out one-off games — Black Friday on Amazon, Christmas on Netflix — as the beginning of a broader trend for the league.\n\n\"It's in the league's best interest to start to create more skinny bundles or smaller packages that they sell,\" Adam Paul, executive director of TV at data company LiveRamp, told Yahoo Finance. \"You're going to see more breaking down of the games or packages into smaller parcels because they can increase the fees that they ultimately get across all of their distribution.\"\n\nBut the NFL said these one-off games are more of the exception than the rule.\n\nThese games \"are a great way to go onto platforms in a smart way, [but] most of our rights, most of our packages will be more than just a couple of games,\" Schroeder said.\n\nThat being said, there's no denying the recent hype around the Olympics has reshaped what's possible in terms of how leagues (namely, the NFL) think about distributing their content.

(Christian Liewig - Corbis via Getty Images) (Christian Liewig - Corbis via Getty Images)\n\n\"The one thing that is unique about the Olympics, but I think other leagues will have to pay attention to, is there's so many events and sports teams going on at once,\" Paul added. \"I could choose to tune in to any event that I wanted to watch at any time throughout the games.\"\n\n\"And so, the most basic and obvious way to think about that for the NFL is, I might live in New York, but I could be a Cowboys fan. That's what consumers want: The optionality to watch the thing I want to watch when I want to watch it.\"\n\n'Consumers are getting savvier'\n\nThe NFL isn't the only league seeing the value of its sports rights go up. Nor has it been the most creative when it comes to divvying up its schedule.\n\nThe NBA, for instance, signed a new media rights deal this year worth around $77 billion over 11 years with new partners that include Amazon and NBCUniversal. It was also able to strike a new agreement with one of its current media partners, Disney. The league did not re-sign with its other partner, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).\n\nThis new deal will see playoff games, including conference finals series in six of the deal's 11 years, air on Amazon Prime.\n\nMeanwhile, the MLB has national television contracts with broadcasters including ESPN, Fox, and TBS. Connected TV platform Roku (ROKU) recently acquired the rights to \"Sunday Leadoff,\" which broadcasts MLB games primarily held on Sunday afternoons, and Apple TV+ airs Friday night games.\n\nSome have argued all of this optionality may lead to more confusion over when, where, and how to watch. The NFL has implemented tools, like a new help center, to combat this confusion, offering fans a personalized view of how to watch games based on location.\n\nBut there's also more access to sports content today than ever before. And more games in more places is the ultimate audience motivator.\n\n\"Consumers are getting savvier,\" said Paul. \"They'll figure it out. Just the rise in streaming has made consumers smarter about how to consume the content that they want to watch.\"\n\nTo that point, TV consumption on streaming has been on a steady rise.\n\nAccording to the latest installment of the Gauge report from Nielsen, streaming hit another record in July, accounting for 41.4% of overall TV viewing. YouTube led the charge, becoming the first streaming platform to break 10% of total TV viewing time.\n\n'How can TV be more like gaming?'\n\nA push to lock in the next generation of NFL fans is central to how games are distributed, and the NFL has even played with the actual broadcasts in an effort to engage younger fans.\n\n\"Younger generations really like gaming and social media just as much, if not more, than television and movies,\" said UVA's Palomba, who specializes in entertainment and consumer behavior. \"How can gaming be more like TV? How can TV be more like gaming?\"\n\nLast year, ESPN and the NFL teamed up for a \"Toy Story Funday Football\" — a fully animated, alternative telecast between the Jaguars and Falcons. CBS also aired a \"Nickelodeon NFL Nickmas Game\" last season and aired an alternate feed of the Super Bowl that featured characters like SpongeBob SquarePants offering commentary on the game.\n\n\"We're still in the early days of figuring out the right way to bring the live game in combination with these other experiences together,\" said Schroeder. \"But the good news is that the opportunity ahead of us is so wide.\" (Courtesy: ESPN, NFL)\n\nAmazon has also leaned in to a more engaged user experience, airing QR codes and interactive banners for viewers to actively shop while watching last year's Black Friday games.\n\nESPN has also found success with the Manningcast, an alternate live TV experience of Monday Night Football hosted by former NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, and tried this format across other sports, like college football and golf.\n\n\"The gamification of NFL football enables greater engagement and satiates younger consumers' [tendencies] to eventually switch to a more interactive experience,\" Palomba said of the recent experiments.\n\n\"If you're in the business of making a profit, if you're in the business of maximizing audiences, you're always looking for different eyeballs,\" Palomba said. \"Wherever you can find them.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Can Help Supercharge Your Portfolio. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Over the long term, the S&P 500 has produced an annualized return of about 10% per year. For the individual investor who wants to pick single businesses, perhaps the obvious goal is to outperform the broader index over the long haul.\n\nThis might seem like a daunting task, as even most active fund managers lose to the market. But I believe average investors can supercharge their returns by focusing on one important characteristic. These stocks are proof that this strategy has merit.\n\nThink like a customer\n\nAs individual investors, we might forget that we have valuable first-hand knowledge of some businesses out there. That's because we are also customers of many companies. It's by using this perspective and identifying businesses that do a fantastic job at taking care of their customers, by offering superior products or services, that we can find potential stock ideas.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's the customers that generate revenue for companies. There is no argument here. This ultimately leads to profits and cash flows, which can result in happy shareholders.\n\nLook at these five stocks\n\nIf you adopt this mental framework, then it's actually quite easy to find businesses that delight their customers. I've chosen five obvious examples.\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST)is loved by its shoppers, who can't get enough of the low prices and treasure hunt experience. The worldwide membership renewal rate of over 90% exemplifies customer loyalty. It's also worth mentioning that the number of member households has climbed 40% in the past five years. In the past decade, this top retail stock has generated a total return of 807%.\n\nThe restaurant industry is extremely competitive, but Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) has found remarkable success by focusing on real ingredients, having a simple menu, and providing customers with tremendous value. This is especially true following the health scare in 2015, when the business regained the trust of consumers and investors. Shares are up 226% in the past five years, propelled partly by 114% sales growth during that time. Image source: Amazon.\n\nCompanies in the tech sector also stand out. Just look at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), which disrupted the media industry with its streaming service that now has 278 million global subscribers. The business provided a much better viewer experience at a lower price point than traditional cable TV.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos was the first to publicly mention in the company's 1997 shareholder letter that obsessing over the customer was a top strategic priority. The business' Prime membership is wildly successful, providing fast and free shipping on millions of items, in addition to other valuable perks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen there's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which sells some of the most in-demand products the world has ever seen. The company's seamless combination of hardware and software creates a powerful ecosystem that essentially locks customers in, bolstered by an active installed base of more than 2.2 billion. Historically, Apple has been able to flex its pricing power, by introducing new devices at fixed price points while offering older models at a discount -- an offer consumers often found too tempting to pass up.\n\nInvestors won't find a lot of investments that fared better than these three. Netflix, Amazon, and Apple have seen their shares soar 933%, 899%, and 768%, respectively, in the past 10 years.\n\nPay the right price\n\nThese five stocks are the perfect example of companies that continue to focus on serving the needs of their customers. Investors can look around and find other businesses doing the same thing. It's another filter to add to your analysis toolkit to use before making an investment decision.\n\nBut to be clear, the previously mentioned stocks aren't automatic buys today. Valuation is another important factor to consider. Looking at the popular forward price-to-earnings ratio in relation to other variables, namely growth potential, I believe investors should wait for a pullback before thinking about buying Costco, Chipotle, and Apple. Netflix and Amazon, on the other hand, look like better buying opportunities at the moment.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 719% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 162% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 3, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "A Photo of the Super Conducting Maglev Train (Photo: Business Wire) For the SC Maglev system, electrical current flows from substations to ground coils based on pre-set patterns, automatically propelling and guiding the train. SC Maglev train acceleration and deceleration is controlled by adjusting the current magnitude and frequency in the propulsion coils. Continuous real-time monitoring of electrical equipment transmitting power to these coils is critical for SC Maglev operations. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nOne of Japan's leading railways to use AWS generative AI, machine learning, and IoT technologies to improve track maintenance and deliver high-quality passenger experiences on the world’s fastest trains\n\nSEATTLE, September 05, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced that the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), which provides high-speed railway services to more than 170 million passengers through Tokaido Shinkansen annually, is using AWS technologies to enhance operations for its Yamanashi Maglev Line. By building critical IT infrastructure workloads on AWS and using AWS's Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, JR Central will advance its data-driven operations, drive operational efficiencies, and reduce maintenance costs.\n\nJR Central is preparing to launch the next generation Super Conducting Maglev (SC Maglev), an ultra-high-speed train that travels at twice the speed of bullet trains by floating and propelling above the tracks using magnetic forces. This new high-speed train service, which is in trial operation in the Yamanashi Maglev Line and expected to travel at speeds of up to 500 km per hour, will cut train travel times in half. For example, Chuo Shinkansen, a new line that is currently under construction, uses the SC Maglev system to take passengers from Tokyo to Nagoya in 40 minutes (versus 86 minutes) and Tokyo to Osaka in 67 minutes (versus 134 minutes). The Chuo Shinkansen will serve as a backup route to the Tokaido Shinkansen in case of emergencies, such as major earthquakes, creating a dual high-speed rail artery.\n\nAWS’s ML and IoT capabilities allow the Yamanashi Maglev Line to use railway infrastructure monitoring data, generated by power lines and electronic track inspection vehicles, to detect signs of impending failure and take corrective action. These insights allow JR Central to predict outages and equipment failure, optimizing the deployment of railroad maintenance workers. For example, the company built an ML model with Amazon SageMaker that identifies power transmission equipment abnormalities. The rail operator visualizes the data with Amazon QuickSight, a cloud-based business intelligence service, to identify machine irregularities, enabling preemptive maintenance to prevent outages and service disruptions. In the future, the Yamanashi Maglev Line plans to use Amazon Bedrock, the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models, to provide employees with recommended actions to take based on equipment manuals and maintenance records.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"By accelerating various innovations using AWS in the Yamanashi Maglev Line, we will realize the future vision of high-speed railway operations,\" said Motoaki Terai, senior corporate executive officer, director general of the Maglev System Development Division of the Chuo Shinkansen Promotion Division, Central Japan Railway Company. \"At JR Central, we're committed to delivering new transportation solutions for our passengers using innovative technology. Our next-generation SC Maglev train line will not only revolutionize travel between Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, but it will also set new global standards for efficiency and safety through data-driven operations.\"\n\nTo drive cloud proficiency across its organization, JR Central’s Maglev System Development Division works with AWS to provide hands-on employee cloud skills training. In 2023, the AWS Professional Services ML Talent Development Support Program trained the division’s mechanical engineers to build and optimize an ML model that identifies power transmission equipment abnormalities.\n\n\"Japan’s world-leading transportation sector is leveraging the cloud to make high-speed rail safer, more efficient, and more enjoyable for passengers,\" said Jaime Vallés, vice president and general manager, Asia Pacific and Japan at AWS. \"Built on AWS, JR Central has the resiliency and innovation needed to offer one of the world’s fastest and most advanced train services operation, using the power of generative AI, machine learning, and data to drive unmatched efficiency. Our partnership is just getting started, and we look forward to pushing the bounds of what’s possible in train travel.\"\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Augmented Reality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\n\nAR/VR Startups\n\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\n\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that  positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAugmented Reality Market & Outlook\n\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\n\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pokémon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers advanced tools for AR and VR developers through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The company also provides AR/VR platforms such as Room Decorator, which allows users to visualize various furniture pieces in their space, and Virtual Try-On, which lets users see how clothing might look on them.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS business is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in artificial intelligence, with operating margins exceeding 37% in the first quarter, 8 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of the past year and around 10 percentage points above the annual average margin since 2018.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s operating income soared 141% year-over-year, reaching a record high. The bulk of this profit came from Amazon Web Services, which accounted for 84% of the company’s second-quarter operating profit. Given AWS’s position as a top cloud platform, industry projections indicate annual growth of 15% to 21% through 2028, making Amazon’s performance a key factor in profit forecasts.\n\nInsider Monkey's research for the March quarter of 2024 showed that 308 out of the 912 hedge funds tracked held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The largest hedge fund investor was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, with a stake valued at $8.46 billion.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Kroger, Albertsons CEOs Tout Deal to Counter Amazon, Walmart",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Kroger Co. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen said he keeps a 2017 article from the Cincinnati Business Courier on his desk with the headline: “How Amazon is Crashing Kroger’s Party.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office Hong Kong’s Arts Hub Turns to Selling Land to Stay Afloat The Outsized Cost of Expanding US Roads\n\nThe clipping is a reminder, McMullen told a federal judge on Wednesday, that Amazon.com Inc. is a “creeping competitor” to the country’s largest supermarket chain, much like Walmart Inc.\n\n“Everyday it reminds me Amazon is going to be a bigger competitor tomorrow than they are today and we can never forget that,” McMullen testified in Portland, Oregon, as part of the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit to block Kroger from buying grocery rival Albertsons Cos. “Amazon is going to be a bigger competitor in five years and 10 years than they are today.”\n\nHigher Prices\n\nAntitrust enforcers allege the $24.6 billion deal would combine the two largest traditional supermarket chains, leading to higher prices for consumers and lower wages for workers. As Kroger’s first witness to take the stand in its defense, McMullen sought to show that his company faces plenty of competition.\n\nThe Albertsons purchase “gives us national coverage and lets us compete better against Costco and Amazon and Walmart,” he said. “Together we believe we can do things we can’t” separately.\n\nAlbertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran, who took the stand after McMullen, said agreeing to a deal with Kroger was “the most consequential decision” of his career. Since taking over as head of the grocer in 2019, Sankaran has sought ways to cut Albertsons costs, but said “there’s always a limit to what we can do.”\n\nThe tie-up will make Kroger and Albertsons “not as big as Walmart but big enough” to help the grocers “change the growth trajectory,” said Sankaran, who was previously at PepsiCo Inc., before helping take Albertsons public in 2020.\n\nUnder Sankaran, Albertsons has focused on selling more fresh, higher-quality foods by relying on a wider network of suppliers. The company continued to centralize how its divisions buy products and remodeled stores, while growing its private-label business and investing in e-commerce. The Boise, Idaho-based company also expanded its offerings of local-specific groceries – what Sankaran has said makes Albertsons unique.\n\nWalmart Supercenter\n\nSupermarkets paid little attention to Walmart in the 1980s when it launched, thinking it was just a retailer, McMullen said. But the Arkansas-based company soon became the largest US seller of paper goods, then diapers and pet food, he said. Grocery stores didn’t really start thinking of Walmart as a competitor until it opened supercenters where it sells food items alongside retail goods, McMullen said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy then it was too late. When Walmart opened its first supercenter in Dixon, Tennessee, in the 1990s, McMullen said, it captured between 30% and 35% of Kroger’s sales in that area overnight. The rapid rise of Walmart and Amazon are part of the transformation of the grocery business where McMullen has worked for the past 46 years, the last decade as Kroger’s CEO.\n\nAfter growing up on his family’s farm in Kentucky and joining Kroger as a part-time bagger in the late 1970s, he worked his way up to chief financial officer in his 30s. As CEO he has led the company through the emergence of online shopping, the pandemic, a period of historic inflation and an almost two-year odyssey to close what would be the biggest US grocery deal.\n\n“When I joined, A&P was the largest grocery retailer,” McMullen said Wednesday. “They don’t even exist today.”\n\nAt Kroger, McMullen has flexed his dealmaking muscles to help the grocer gain scale and compete. He and his team helped lead various deals such as Fred Meyer Inc., Roundy’s Inc. and Home Chef, among others.\n\nAs CEO, he has pushed the Cincinnati-based grocer to diversify operations beyond the four walls of its stores. McMullen has said Kroger competes for food spending against a range of businesses from restaurants to dollar stores.\n\nAnalytics, Advertising\n\nKroger expanded into data analytics and advertising, and signed a deal with Ocado Group Plc in which the UK company would build warehouses for online orders. Along with the rest of the grocery sector, Kroger has been beefing up its private-label and prepared food offerings to draw more shoppers. Today, it is one of the largest sellers of sushi and a major producer of milk in the US.\n\nIf the deal with Albertsons goes through, Kroger has promised to invest $1 billion annually in cutting prices, McMullen said Wednesday. While acknowledging that the promise isn’t legally binding, McMullen said the company has made the pledge publicly and to investors and would suffer reputational harm if it pulls back. He also denied the FTC’s contention that the deal would give Kroger the ability to raise prices.\n\nIf we raised prices “we would lose a significant amount of business to Aldi, Costco, Walmart and others,” he said.\n\nAlbertsons, which started as a single store, has had a windy history. Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management took a stake in the company almost two decades ago. After acquiring Safeway, the grocer tried to go public but canceled its plans due to soft market conditions in 2015. It tried again to go public after buying Rite Aid Corp. in 2018, but pulled that deal due to investor pushback. Less than two years after going public, Albertsons began exploring strategic alternatives to improve value for shareholders.\n\nAlbertsons’ Sankaran said in his testimony that if the acquisition doesn’t move forward, he will need to make some “tough decisions” that could include layoffs, closing stores or seeking another acquisition partner. Under questioning by the FTC, he acknowledged that Albertsons is financially sound and had profits of $4.3 billion in its last fiscal year.\n\n“We are developing early perspectives” about options if the deal doesn’t go through, Sankaran said. “I don’t have a plan today to take action tomorrow.”\n\n(Updates with comments from Albertsons CEO beginning in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America’s Immigration Courts Brazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show La justicia no viene al caso en las cortes de inmigración de EE.UU.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\n\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow​.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\n\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug​.\n\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon’s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company’s total sales​. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure​. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Recent reports indicate that Amazon will use Anthropic's AI model, developed by a California-based startup, to power the latest updates to its virtual assistant, Alexa. This decision hints at shortcomings in Amazon's in-house AI models, with some sources telling Reuters that these internal models suffer from lag times of six to seven seconds and issues with consistency and accuracy. The tech giant plans to charge $5 or $10 per month for Alexa's advanced AI features.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also in the news after recent reports in the media claimed that Chinese companies are bypassing US export bans on AI-related products, software, and technology by leveraging American cloud service providers. These providers, including Amazon's AWS, have integrated AI features into their platforms over the past few months to meet the rapidly growing demand for advanced technology. A report initially published by Reuters alleges that Amazon has granted Chinese entities access to high-end AI chips and advanced models such as Claude.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Beyond Meat (BYND) founder and CEO Ethan Brown isn't letting challenging industry conditions distract him from his mission to expand the plant-based meat market.\n\n\"I think we feel really good about where we are. We've been now public for over five years, and there was this tremendous growth in the category and then a contraction, and Beyond Meat continues to lead. And we think we're going to lead the next phase of growth for the category and for Beyond Meat,\" Brown said on Yahoo Finance, following a breakfast meeting inside Nasdaq's headquarters on Wednesday.\n\nThe challenges Beyond Meat are facing continue to be formidable.\n\nSecond quarter sales fell 8.8% from the prior year to $93.2 million, led by an 18.9% drop among food service partners in the US. Sales at US retail locations dropped 7.5% year over year. The company lost $23 million on an adjusted operating income basis.\n\nFor the six months ended June 24, Beyond's cash pile fell 24.4% to $144.8 million as the company battles to win market share from those that consume traditional meat.\n\nTo right the ship, Beyond Meat has overhauled its product line and plans to market aggressively the health benefits of its offerings.\n\nIn late February, Beyond Meat shifted to avocado oil in its signature burger and beef — a move that cut the saturated fat count by 60% compared to the previous version. Prior iterations used a combination of canola oil and refined coconut oil. The company has since made the same switch for its sausages.\n\nOther new ingredients include red lentil and faba bean protein. Previously, the company used a mixture of pea and rice proteins. Overall, Beyond Meat said it reduced the number of ingredients for the products.\n\nThe company was also able to secure a label from the American Heart Association (AHA) that marks the product as a \"heart-healthy recipe.\"\n\nBeyond Meat also showed off a whole muscle steak product to Yahoo Finance that will be packaged to look like filet mignon, and priced at a premium.\n\nNo launch date was provided.

        "title": "Is It Time to Buy August's Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stocks?",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8% in August. That's a great performance, especially considering the widely followed index is up roughly 8.5% year to date.\n\nHowever, several Dow stocks fell last month. Is it time to buy August's worst-performing Dow Jones stocks?\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) stood out by far as the worst Dow stock last month. Shares of the chipmaker plunged 28% in August and are down close to 60% in 2024.\n\nWhat's behind Intel's malaise? Much of it is caused by changing market dynamics, with a marked increase in competition. Revenue and earnings are declining. The company plans to suspend its dividend in the fourth quarter. Intel is slashing costs, reducing its headcount by over 15%. Some investors are concerned that these cost-cutting efforts will include throwing in the towel on constructing a new chip fabrication plant in Germany.\n\nThe picture looked even worse only a few days ago. However, Intel's shares rebounded somewhat after news reports that the company was evaluating a spin-off of its manufacturing operations from its core chip design business.\n\nIs Intel stock a good pick for investors looking for turnaround opportunities? Maybe, but I think the safest move is to stay on the sidelines for now. Intel competes in an intensively competitive industry where the company's central processing units (CPUs) have lost ground to graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\n2. Chevron\n\nChevron's (NYSE: CVX) performance in August wasn't nearly as bad as Intel's. However, shares of the oil and gas giant still slid 7.8% lower last month. Chevron stock is also down slightly year to date.\n\nIt didn't help matters that Chevron's second-quarter earnings, which were reported on Aug. 2, came in below Wall Street's expectations. Investors are also anxious about Chevron's pending acquisition of Hess. This deal is important to Chevron because it would greatly expand and diversify the company's portfolio and production capacity. An arbitration panel plans to conduct a hearing in 2025 to address an issue related to ExxonMobil's challenge related to a joint venture in Guyana.\n\nHowever, Chevron's management remains confident the Hess deal will close. More importantly, the company should be able to generate strong earnings and free cash flow growth over the long term regardless of what happens with this acquisition.\n\nI think Chevron is a great pick to buy on the dip for income investors. The company's forward dividend yield was 4.4% at the end of Tuesday's trading session. Chevron has increased its dividend payout for 37 consecutive years.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock skyrocketed 80% last year. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud services leader are beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024. However, August was a down month for Amazon, with the stock slipping 4.5% -- enough to make it the third-worst performer in the Dow.\n\nYou can blame Amazon's August decline squarely on its Q2 update. The company missed analysts' revenue estimates. Its guidance for Q3 revenue also fell short of expectations.\n\nI think these are only short-term issues resulting from customers who are still feeling the sting of inflation and are focusing more on lower-price products. But inflation is moderating. Amazon's underlying businesses remain strong. And the key is that the migration to the cloud -- where Amazon is an industry leader, through Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- is still only in its early innings. Most global information technology (IT) spending still goes to traditional on-premises equipment and infrastructure. Over the next 10 to 15 years, this spending should shift increasingly to cloud-based solutions, with AWS poised to be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nWe're also talking about a company that continually finds new markets to enter. Another one should be right around the corner. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the Q2 conference call that the company will begin shipping production satellites later in 2024. He added that management thinks \"this could be a very large business for us.\"\n\nIs Amazon a Dow stock to buy on the dip? Absolutely.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 755% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 166% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now…\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 3, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Generative AI Sales Could Soar 2,040%: My Pick for the Best AI Stock to Buy Now (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "In late 2022, digital assistant ChatGPT popularized generative artificial intelligence (AI), which uses machine learning models to create media content like text, images, and video. Since ChatGPT hit the market, companies across every industry have invested aggressively in generative AI, hoping to boost worker productivity through automation.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia has benefited greatly from that development. Its revenue nearly tripled in the past year due to unprecedented demand for its data center GPUs, and its share price rocketed 145% during the same period. However, investors who missed those gains have not missed their chance to make money on the AI boom.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI sales will increase by 2,040% to $1.4 trillion by 2032, compounding at 41% annually. That rising tide will lift many companies higher over the next decade, but Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) should be a major winner. Here's why.\n\nAmazon is investing in artificial intelligence across its three core businesses\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three quickly growing markets. As measured by revenue, the company runs the leading e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It is the third-largest digital advertiser in the world and the largest retail media advertiser. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the dominant public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services.\n\nAmazon uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency and create new revenue streams across all three business segments.\n\nE-commerce: In February, Amazon launched a generative AI shopping assistant (Rufus) for consumers. It has also introduced generative AI tools that help sellers create product listings. Additionally, in North American fulfillment centers, Amazon uses generative AI and computer vision to uncover product defects before they are shipped to consumers. And it uses machine learning to optimize warehouse inventory and last-mile delivery, making its logistics business more efficient. Digital advertising: Last year, Amazon introduced a generative AI tool that lets marketers create relevant and engaging lifestyle images featuring their products, which theoretically helps brands run more cost-effective advertising campaigns. Additionally, Amazon uses machine learning to ensure consumers see relevant sponsored product advertising on the marketplace. Cloud computing: AWS has designed custom AI chips for training and inference as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia GPUs. The company has also added new features to its machine learning platform SageMaker and generative AI platform Bedrock. CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts, \"During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined.\"\n\nMore broadly, AWS accounted for 32% of cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) spending in the June quarter, which puts it nine percentage points ahead of the next closest competitor, Microsoft Azure. Leadership in CIPS means AWS should be a major beneficiary as businesses spend more aggressively on artificial intelligence.\n\nIn a recent note, Jim Kelleher at Argus wrote, \"As the leading provider of infrastructure-as-a-service and other cloud services, AWS is positioned uniquely in the burgeoning AI-as-a-service market.\" Additionally, executives surveyed by Morgan Stanley collectively see Microsoft Azure and AWS as the public clouds most likely to gain share in generative AI in the next three years.\n\nAmazon stock trades at a reasonable valuation\n\nRetail e-commerce sales are projected to increase by 8% annually through 2028, and digital ad spending is projected to grow by 10% annually during the same period, according to eMarketer. But retail media is one of the fastest-growing verticals in advertising, so Amazon should outpace the average. Indeed, the company is gaining share so fast that it could overtake Meta Platforms as the second-largest ad tech company by 2030.\n\nAdditionally, the International Data Corp. (IDC) estimates that public cloud spending will increase by 19% annually through 2028. However artificial intelligence platform services are expected to be the fastest-growing vertical within cloud computing, with spending compounding at 51% annually during that period. That bodes well for AWS given its leadership in CIPS.\n\nThose forecasts give Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales for the foreseeable future, and earnings should grow slightly faster as the company prioritizes cost control. Wall Street expects Amazon's adjusted earnings to increase at 25% annually through 2025, which makes the current valuation of 42 times adjusted earnings seem reasonable. That's why now is a good time for patient investors to buy a small position in Amazon stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon has launched an AI-powered shopping assistant – named Rufus – in the UK for the first time.\n\nThe new chatbot, which is initially being launched to a subset of customers in Amazon’s mobile app, has been trained on Amazon’s product catalogue and information from across the web to enable it to answer any shopping queries users have.\n\nThe US tech giant said Rufus can help shoppers with broad research questions such as “What do I need for making smoothies?” to comparisons between different types of products and even specific questions about individual items.\n\nRufus was first introduced in the US earlier this year, and is the latest in a ever-growing list of examples where tech firms have looked to build generative AI tools into their services as a way to entice customers. Rufus can answer a range of queries from shoppers about specific products, or broader topics (Amazon/PA)\n\nGenerative AI has become the focal point for innovation in the tech sector since the launch of ChatGPT nearly two years ago.\n\nWhile many firms, including Amazon, have used other forms of artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their products and services for years, the ability of generative AI to create responses and even content from scratch is seen a major step forward.\n\n“Amazon has been using AI very expansively for over 25 years to improve customer experiences,” Amazon said in a blog post about the launch of Rufus.\n\n“The personalised recommendations customers get when they shop on Amazon’s store, the pick-paths in our fulfilment centres, and the conversational capabilities of Alexa are just a few examples of experiences fuelled by AI.\n\n“And we believe generative AI is going to change virtually all customer experiences that we know.\n\n“We are excited about the potential of generative AI and will continue testing new features to make it even easier to find and discover, research and buy products on Amazon’s store.\n\n“We look forward to progressively rolling Rufus out to additional customers in the coming weeks.”\n\nOnce available, Rufus will appear as an icon in the bottom corner of the screen within the Amazon Shopping app, with users able to expand the chat box to see answers to their questions, as well as tap on suggested questions and ask follow-up questions.\n\nAmazon confirmed users will be able to return to traditional search results at any time by swiping down to close the chat box.",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Admitted He Was 'Too Dumb' And An 'Idiot' For Not Investing In Amazon Early On – But Finally Took The Plunge 5 Years Ago",
        "content": "Regret is a tough pill to swallow, especially in business, where missed opportunities can mean billions left on the table. Yet even the most legendary investors aren't immune to it.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire behind Berkshire Hathaway, has built his empire on sharp decision-making and a deep understanding of business fundamentals. He's undeniably one of the most successful investors of all time. But there's one major investment Buffett wishes he'd made sooner: Amazon. And he's not shy about admitting it.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, when Amazon was just an online bookstore with big dreams, Buffett had the chance to invest. He also passed on buying shares during Amazon's IPO in 1997. Reflecting on this now, Buffett doesn't shy away from admitting his mistake. \"I was too dumb to realize\" the potential of Amazon and its visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, he's said, with his usual blend of humility and humor. In fact, he's gone as far as to call himself an \"idiot\" for not snapping up Amazon shares earlier, confessing that it was his \"stupidity\" that kept him from seeing what Bezos was building.\n\nTrending:\n\nCan you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average? IRS Finalizes 10-Year Rule For Retirement Withdrawals, Making Things ‘Even More Insanely Complicated’\n\nBuffett's regret isn't just about missing out on a financial windfall. It's also tied to his deep respect for Bezos, whom he describes as a thinker of rare clarity and brilliance. He's marveled at Bezos's managerial genius and how Amazon has shattered expectations, growing from a small startup into a massive powerhouse dominating the market. He even said in 2016, \"you're not going to find another Jeff Bezos.\"\n\nDespite his admiration for Bezos, Buffett's cautious approach to investing, particularly his wariness of high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stocks and tech companies, led him to hesitate. \"I invest in what I understand,\" he's often said, and back then, technology was a world that felt outside his comfort zone.\n\nBut Amazon isn't the only tech giant Buffett regrets passing on. He's been just as upfront about missing out on early investments in Google and Microsoft – companies that have transformed the world in ways few could have predicted. Buffett didn’t hold back during a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, labeling these missed chances as \"stupid mistakes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that Buffett's investment strategy has always been about the long game, with a focus on businesses he deeply understands. That approach has served him and Berkshire Hathaway incredibly well over the decades, even if it meant occasionally leaving money on the table. In recent years, though, there's been a subtle shift. In 2019, Berkshire started buying Amazon shares – not because Buffett suddenly changed his mind, but because one of his investment managers saw its value. This move signals a broader recognition within Berkshire of technology companies’ undeniable influence in today's economy.\n\nBuffett's openness about his missteps offers a valuable lesson: Even the best can get it wrong sometimes. What sets Buffett apart is his willingness to admit when he's made a mistake and his commitment to learning from those experiences. As he often reminds us, \"The most important investment you can make is in yourself.\" It's a reminder that, in investing and in life, the ability to grow and adapt is as important as the ability to succeed.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital.

        "title": "Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) investors will be pleased with their notable 95% return over the last five years",
        "content": "If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is 95% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 29%.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Amazon.com achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Amazon.com scores on these 3 valuation metrics.\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "UK investors are flocking to passive funds as only two of Interactive Investor top 10 most-bought investments in August are active funds in a list where Nvidia (NVDA) is the most bought stock.\n\nFundsmith Equity (0P0000RU81.L) has dropped from the top 10 for the first time since Interactive Investor began tracking its most-bought investments in 2018. Manager Terry Smith faces the headwinds of global stock market returns being heavily influenced by a small number of US technology companies.\n\nVanguard (VUSA.L) passive funds took the lead, with the asset manager taking five of the top 10 slots. The only active funds that made it into the top 10 in August were the Royal London Short Term Money Market (0P0000NRQO.L) and Jupiter India (0P00018LFD.L).\n\nThe L&G Global Technology Index Trust (0P0000XAFS.L) was the most bought investment last month on the platform as “many investors are positioning themselves for technology shares to continue their fine form”, Kyle Caldwell, funds and investment education editor at Interactive Investor, said.\n\nIn second place is Vanguard LifeStrategy 80% Equity (0P0000TKZM.L) and Royal London Short Term Money Market came in third.\n\nLooking at the top stocks, August proved to be a turbulent month for equities, with volatility sweeping across markets. Among the companies navigating this choppy environment was Nvidia, which released its latest quarterly update during the month.\n\nDespite the semiconductor giant surpassing analysts’ expectations, the heightened market volatility led to a decline in its share price. Nevertheless, Nvidia continued to be the favoured pick among investors, maintaining its position as the top choice in the US market.\n\nIn contrast, Tesla (TSLA), once a stalwart in the rankings, saw its fortunes shift dramatically. The electric vehicle manufacturer reported disappointing Q2 2024 earnings, which triggered a sharp reassessment by investors. As a result, Tesla plummeted out of the top 10 list entirely in August, a significant drop from its third-place standing in July.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Nvidia, Rolls-Royce, Tesla and Intel\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and HSBC (HSBA.L) made their way onto the list, signalling renewed investor interest. Moving in the opposite direction, easyJet (EZJ.L), which had previously been a popular choice, dropped out of the rankings.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “August started shakily and ended strongly, providing some buying opportunities as the month progressed either to add to holdings or to buy on the dip, and ii [Interactive Investor] customers took full advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\n“At the centre of the volatility was the US market darling Nvidia, which not only was at the centre of a technology tempest but also reported its latest quarterly update which, despite beating expectations, resulted in a fall in the share price. However, this was not enough to deter investors – for ii [Interactive Investor] the stock remains top of the most bought .”\n\nIn the UK, familiar names dominated the scene. Rolls-Royce (RR.L) continued to be a favourite among investors, adding 7% in August, bringing its total gain for the year to 66%.\n\nAdditionally, income-generating stocks remained in strong demand. Legal & General (LGEN.L), which also reported earnings in August, boasts a dividend yield of 9.2% and was accompanied by other high-yielding stocks such as BP (BP.L) (5.3%), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) (5%), HSBC (7%, rising to 9.4% with special dividends), and Rio Tinto (RIO.L) (7%).\n\nCaldwell looked at Fundsmith Equity and said that although it has outperformed the wider global market since it launched in November 2010, its performance has lagged over the past couple of years.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks crawl higher ahead of manufacturing data\n\n“Fundsmith Equity manager Terry Smith, like other professional investors, is continuing to face into the headwind of global stock market returns being heavily influenced by a small number of US technology companies,” he said.\n\n“Many investors are positioning themselves for technology shares to continue their fine form. L&G Technology Index retains its place as the most-bought fund. It has large positions, just over 40% of the fund, in Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. Therefore, holding this fund could spell trouble for investors who are overexposed to technology should there be a sharp correction,” he added.\n\nThe fund has only grown 6.8% over the last three years compared to an IA Global index growth of 11.5%.\n\nIn trusts, Scottish Mortgage (SMT.L) continued in its widespread popularity, but other tech trusts like Polar Capital Technology (PCT.L) and Allianz Technology (ATT.L) continued their long-running strength.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the first tech giants to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the dot-com boom in 1999, is now facing the possibility of losing its place in the prestigious index, according to an article from Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nThe publication notes that the American chipmaker's shares have slumped nearly 60% this year, making it the worst performer on the Dow and leaving it with the lowest stock price in the price-weighted index.\n\nA potential removal from the Dow would be a significant blow to Intel's already struggling reputation. The company missed out on the surge in artificial intelligence opportunities after opting not to invest in OpenAI, and its contract manufacturing unit, intended to compete with TSMC, has been suffering mounting losses, as reported by Reuters.\n\nTo finance a turnaround, Intel recently suspended its dividend and announced layoffs impacting 15% of its workforce, moves revealed during its last earnings report.\n\nHowever, speaking to Reuters, some analysts and a former board member expressed concerns that these actions may be too little, too late.\n\nRyan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, told Reuters that Intel being removed was likely a long time coming, with the company's latest disappointing results potentially being the final push needed to see it ousted from the Dow.\n\nThe index's selection committee makes changes as necessary, with the most recent adjustment occurring in February when Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was replaced by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nUnlike the S&P 500, which considers market value, stock price plays a crucial role in Dow inclusion. Currently, Intel is the least influential member of the index, with a weight of just 0.32%, according to Reuters.\n\nExclusion from the Dow would likely exacerbate Intel's struggles, further impacting its shares.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel's Dow status under threat: analysts\n\nBoeing free cash flow expected to be capped in \"a few years\" - Wells Fargo\n\nIllumina wins Grail battle in blow to EU merger power\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the biggest winners since the start of this millennium and has delivered stellar returns for long-term investors. On the other hand, the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant has actually been lagging behind the broader market in 2024.\n\nWhile Amazon stock has risen roughly 17.5% across this year's trading, the S&P 500 index has delivered a dividend-adjusted total return of 19.5% as of this writing.\n\nEven though Amazon has underperformed the benchmark index this year, investors shouldn't bet on that continuing to be the case over the long term. In fact, the stage appears to be set for the stock to deliver market-crushing returns over the next five years -- and artificial intelligence (AI) could be at the center of an incredible transformation.\n\nAmazon can still deliver huge earnings growth\n\nTake a look at the chart below, which tracks Amazon's quarterly operating margin over the last five years. AMZN Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nAs the chart shows, the tech giant's operating margin has seen some big swings -- but it's trending in an encouraging direction. Some key macroeconomic pressures began easing in 2023, and performance across two quarters in 2024 seemingly has the company on track to record its highest-ever annual operating margin. There are good reasons to think that performance will continue to improve.\n\nDriven by the still growing, higher margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services business, and the rapidly expanding -- and highly profitable -- digital advertising business, overall margins have expanded since 2023.\n\nWhile the e-commerce business still accounts for the majority of total sales, AWS and the digital ads business should continue to account for a growing portion of sales, helping push margins and overall profits higher. Even better, there's a good chance its massive online retail business will become significantly more profitable thanks to the rise of AI and robotics.\n\nDespite generating huge amounts of revenue, e-commerce is still a relatively low-margin business for Amazon.

        "title": "3 Sensational Warren Buffett Stocks That Make for Slam-Dunk Buys in September",
        "content": "Few investors are more revered on Wall Street than the aptly named \"Oracle of Omaha.\" Since Warren Buffett became the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a greater than 5,700,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) and guided Berkshire to become only the ninth public company to reach the $1 trillion market cap plateau.\n\nWhen you outperform Wall Street's major stock indexes by as much as Buffett has spanning almost six decades, you're going to garner quite the audience. Investors regularly wait on the edge of their seat to find out which stocks he and his investment team have been buying and selling. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAt the moment, Buffett and his top aides are overseeing a 45-stock, $318 billion portfolio. However, the outlooks for these holdings meaningfully differ.\n\nAs we motor ahead into September, three sensational Warren Buffett stocks stand out for all the right reasons and make for slam-dunk buys.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first outstanding Buffett stock that long-term investors can confidently add to their portfolio in September is e-commerce leaderAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe biggest knock you'll find with Amazon is that it's cyclical. Most people are familiar with the company because of its world-leading e-commerce segment. If the U.S. or global economy weakens and online retail sales growth slows or shifts into reverse, there's the perception that Amazon is going to struggle.\n\nHowever, there's a lot more to Amazon than just e-commerce. Though online retail sales generate a lot of revenue, the razor-thin margins associated with e-commerce are responsible for little in the way of operating cash flow and net income. Rather, the bread-and-butter of Amazon's cash flow can be traced to its three high-growth ancillary operating segments.\n\nAmazon's linchpin is its cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on estimates from tech analysis firm Canalys, AWS accounted for a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending in the June-ended quarter. Through the remainder of this decade, businesses are expected to shift more of their spending toward cloud services, which should only fuel double-digit growth potential for AWS.\n\nThe second fast-paced operating segment that's been a cash cow for Amazon is advertising services. The ability to draw well over 3 billion visitors to its website each month provides an insatiable lure for businesses that want to get their message(s) in front of consumers. Whether its Amazon's growing content library or its online marketplace, it's having little issue commanding top-notch ad-pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third piece of the puzzle is subscription services, such as Prime. In April 2021, former CEO and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos cited that Prime had surpassed 200 million global subscribers. With the company securing an 11-year streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and becoming the exclusive streaming partner for Thursday Night Football, Prime also possess exceptional pricing power.\n\nShares of Amazon can be purchased right now for less than 12 times forecast cash flow for 2025, which works out to a 47% discount to its average forward-year cash flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMastercard\n\nA second phenomenal Warren Buffett stock that makes for a slam-dunk buy in September is global payment-processing juggernaut Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\n\nSimilar to Amazon, being cyclical is typically the biggest concern for current and prospective shareholders of Mastercard. When the U.S. and/or global economy weaken, it's pretty normal for consumers and businesses to reduce their discretionary spending.\n\nThe good news for Mastercard is that the long-term numbers game is very much on its side. Out of the 12 U.S. recessions that have occurred since the end of World War II, only three reached the 12-month mark, and none surpassed 18 months. Conversely, a majority of economic expansions endured multiple years, with two lasting at least 10 years. Long-term growth in the U.S. economy leads to a fairly steady increase in spending activity.\n\nAnother reason Mastercard's management team has been able to successfully navigate the company through periods of uncertainty is because it steers clear of lending and focuses entirely on payment facilitation. Although Mastercard's brand is well-known, and it would likely have no issue becoming a respected lender, its avoidance of lending means the company doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses and credit delinquencies during economic downturns. This helps it bounce back from recessions faster than most financial stocks.\n\nMastercard is also still in the early innings of expanding its infrastructure into faster-growing, but chronically underbanked, emerging markets. Sans currency changes, cross-border payment volume grew by 17% on a year-over-year basis in the June-ended quarter, and has been rising by a double-digit percentage with consistency for as far back as the eye can see. Regardless of whether this expansion is organic or acquisitive, Mastercard has a multidecade opportunity to infiltrate these underbanked markets in Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nShares of Mastercard can be picked up for 29 times forward-year earnings. Though this might sound pricey, it's actually a 14% discount to its average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over the last five years, and represents a reasonable bargain with the company expected to grow its earnings per share by an annual average of 17% through 2028.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nThe third sensational Warren Buffett stock that makes for a slam-dunk buy in September is the only high-profile stock-split stock of 2024 that's set to conduct a reverse-stock split. I'm talking about satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nThe key headwind to monitor with Sirius XM is the health of the auto market. Sirius XM's satellite-radio services are offered with most new vehicle sales. The company counts on a certain percentage of these promotional three-month trials turning into self-pay subscribers. If auto sales weaken, self-pay subscriber additions can slow -- and we've certainly seen some evidence of a slowdown through the first six months of 2024.\n\nWhile Sirius XM's high-growth heyday is long gone, it does have a handful of sustained competitive advantages it can lean on that should, over time, help make patient shareholders richer.\n\nFor one, it's a legally licensed monopoly. Although it still competes for listeners with terrestrial and online radio providers, being the only satellite-radio company should afford Sirius XM strong subscription pricing power.\n\nThere's also a huge difference in revenue generation between Sirius XM and traditional radio providers. Whereas terrestrial and online radio companies rely heavily on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM generates less than 20% of its net sales from ads. Its primary revenue driver is subscriptions -- about 77% of net sales through the first six months of 2024.\n\nBeing reliant on ad revenue isn't a bad thing a majority of the time. But when recessions do occur, it tends to clobber terrestrial and online radio operators. Since Sirius XM brings in most of its net sales from subscriptions, its operating cash flow has far fewer ebbs-and-flows than traditional radio companies.\n\nThe other big catalyst for Sirius XM is its imminent merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group. This combination will create a single class of Sirius XM shares, with Sirius XM effecting a 1-for-10 reverse split upon completion. A higher nominal share price should put Sirius XM on the radar of more institutional investors.\n\nLastly, Sirius XM's forward P/E ratio of a little over 10 is very close to a 30-year low. When coupled with its hearty 3.2% yield, Sirius XM makes for a no-brainer buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "When investing, the focus should always be on a company's long-term potential. It's easy to get caught up in a company's short-term happenings (I'm also guilty of this), but the long-term matters because that's where true wealth is built.\n\nThe following two companies both operate in industries that are early in what many expect them to ultimately become. They've each had hiccups, but when you zoom out and look at their operations and potential, they seem like no-brainer buys at current prices.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nCybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) has been in the news quite a bit lately, and not for good reasons. After a faulty software update triggered the largest global IT outage in history, the company's stock price plunged as investors left in droves.\n\nThe outage was unfortunate for CrowdStrike and everyone affected, but investors' response may have been a little over the top. The good news, though, is that CrowdStrike is now priced much more reasonably than it was before the incident.\n\nThere are still some short-term uncertainties surrounding CrowdStrike, including the financial impact of the outage and how many of its customers decide to switch to another provider, but results from its recent quarter show the business is still thriving.\n\nCrowdStrike ended the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year (ended July 31) with more than $3.8 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up 32% year over year. In the quarter alone, it added $218 million in new ARR, helping to bring its revenue to $964 million, also up 32% year over year.\n\nThat's continuing its impressive growth, which has seen its revenue grow by almost 2,000% in the past six years. CRWD Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIt's not just that CrowdStrike is generating more revenue that's impressive, either. It's that the company is doing so more profitably than before. Its $227 million in operating income (profit from its core business) in the second quarter was $71 million more than in 2023, and its margins on the income went from 21% to 24% in that span.\n\nEven with the IT outage, one thing remains true: It's not easy for companies -- especially larger ones with more complex operations -- to completely change cybersecurity providers. And considering CrowdStrike's problem wasn't the result of a cyberattack, I don't believe customers will lose faith in the effectiveness of its product.\n\nNow may not be the time to go all in on the stock, but the 30% drop from its early July peak makes it a compelling time to begin (or increase) a stake in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nIt hasn't been the best past half year for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), with the stock down in that span, but it remains one of the more compelling companies on the market.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Amazon's e-commerce business. It's what has made Amazon a household name and largely the reason the company only trails Walmart when it comes to revenue generation. In the past four quarters, Amazon has generated more than $600 billion in revenue. In its latest quarter, it generated $148 billion (up 10% year over year), with e-commerce accounting for the vast majority of it.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business speaks for itself. However, its growth -- and where it makes the most profit -- comes from its cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud computing platform, with a 31% market share that leads Microsoft's Azure 25% and Alphabet's Google Cloud 11%.\n\nAWS generated $26.3 billion in revenue, more than most S&P 500 companies generate in a single quarter. Its $9.3 billion in operating income also accounted for more than 63% of Amazon's total operating income. AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe cloud industry has a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and Amazon stands to gain a lot as the market leader. Microsoft's Azure has been gaining ground and new artificial intelligence (AI) developments have bolstered platforms' offerings. However, AWS is positioning itself as the one-stop-shop platform companies can use to create their own generative AI, machine learning, and other AI tools.\n\nBeing developer-friendly can help AWS attract and retain top companies globally who need to develop AI tools efficiently without dedicating the resources (talent, time, and money) it often takes to do so in-house. This strategy should help AWS sustain its leadership position in the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nWith a bustling e-commerce business and a thriving cloud business with (presumably) much growth ahead of it, Amazon could be a cornerstone piece in many investors' portfolios.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,104!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,321!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $378,232!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of August 26, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\n\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\n\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\n\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\n\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data—not too hot, not too cold—that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\n\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on  “historical trends” and the “market landscape” from various sectors which have “substantial” potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon's stock recently plummeted following its disappointing third-quarter revenue guidance, prompting a significant market reaction. Despite this, Goldman Sachs tech analyst Sheridan has maintained a positive outlook on the company, even lowering his price target from $250 to $230. Sheridan argues that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reaccelerating, largely driven by increased enterprise-level workload migration and growing AI workloads. He believes that AWS remains an undervalued asset within Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), especially considering its 19% growth rate and mid-30s GAAP operating income margin.\n\nInvestors fear that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) potentially overbuilding its cloud infrastructure may outpace demand. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a long-term growth potential, particularly as operating margins are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. The current stock price, around $170, is relatively cheap given the anticipated earnings growth in the coming years.\n\nScott Devitt from Wedbush on CNBC, highlighted a $1 billion currency headwind that impacted the top line. While AWS exceeded expectations with a 19% growth rate, the company's advertising revenue underperformed, coming in at 19.5%, below the consensus of 22%. This underperformance contrasts with strong advertising results from other tech giants like Meta.\n\nWhile the disappointing advertising revenue is concerning, AWS's strong performance is a positive sign for Amazon's long-term growth. The stock's decline could be considered as a potential buying opportunity, especially given the strength in AWS. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, particularly in the cloud and AI sectors. Investors are encouraged to focus on the bigger picture of sustained growth, rather than short-term fluctuations.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

This disappointment led to a relatively muted market reaction, with only modest movements in major indices.\n\n\"Turns out that the company is mortal after all. Even though it reported a great quarter last night, it wasn’t able to deliver its key product fast enough to allow the company to do what it’s done so many times before: blow away earnings and raise forecasts to unfathomable levels. The company didn’t define today’s trading because it failed to dazzle in the way that so many money managers had come to expect. The major indices didn’t move much—the Dow advanced 244 points, the S&P was basically flat, and the NASDAQ dipped just 0.23%.\"\n\nCramer expressed relief that the company’s quarter brought an end to the unrealistic expectations that had surrounded the stock. He emphasized that the company is not a miracle company but a firm specializing in high-performance chips that enhance productivity and problem-solving. Cramer noted that the market had unfairly elevated the company to a status where it was expected to perform miraculous feats beyond its actual capabilities.\n\n\"My response to all this? Goodness gracious! With this quarter’s results, the albatross of perfection is now gone; the millstone has been shredded. As much as I love the company, I’m thrilled that we can finally return to a market where there are many important stocks representing many important trends, rather than just one stock capturing the attention of legions of investors—many of whom have no idea what it does, let alone where it fits into the technological food chain.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that, in the end, the company isn’t a concept; it’s not a cult; it’s not a miracle maker. It’s a company that designs incredibly fast chips that enable rapid calculations to help companies speed up problem-solving and improve productivity. You can’t ask the company’s Blackwell chip to cure cancer or put a man on Mars, and it certainly can’t bring about world peace. Yet, when you look at how this stock was trading in recent weeks, the market was basically asking CEO Jensen Huang to do all these things and more.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe believes the company should be held as an investment, not traded based on fluctuating expectations. While acknowledging that the stock had become overvalued before the quarter, Cramer maintains his belief in the company’s value.\n\n\"Right now, it looks like the company can expand customer gross margins—important but not earth-shaking, especially since the enterprise is the client, not you; you won’t even see it. Now that this quarter is in the rearview mirror, my hope is that those who wagered on the stock, rather than invested in the company, will finally move on. No more exacting comparisons with AMD, please. We need to go back to a world where we value the company like any other company, with a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple based on its growth.\"\n\nJim Cramer also addressed the question of whether AI investments are yielding tangible returns, especially in terms of improving gross margins. He noted that many of the most convincing AI applications have taken time to develop. Early investment in AI often focuses on training models, and only after this stage can AI start delivering practical benefits. Cramer emphasized that AI's most significant impacts are typically in enterprise settings rather than for individual consumers.\n\n\"For the skeptics, the most compelling AI use cases have been slow to develop. Much of the early investment goes toward training AI models. Only after this process comes to fruition can artificial intelligence actually do something useful for users. It's important to note that most areas where AI is truly useful are enterprise-oriented.\n\nAs a consumer, you may not see how effective these models can be. Keep the term \"enterprise\" in mind, because it means it's not aimed at individual users. That’s why tonight I’m going to start something new: a running list of some of the best AI use cases we've heard about.\"\n\nTo highlight the progress in this area, Cramer is introducing a new feature: a running list of notable AI use cases. He pointed out that some AI applications have been in use for a while. For instance, OpenAI generates revenue from its ChatGPT offerings, with a free version available alongside paid subscriptions like ChatGPT Plus for $20 a month and more expensive options for businesses.\n\n\"Some of these have been around for a while. For example, there's a free version of ChatGPT, but OpenAI generates revenue from $20-a-month ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, as well as higher-priced offerings for enterprise customers. The same goes for Gemini and Claude, which have similar pricing. Microsoft's Copilot functionality and Adobe's Firefly tools have also been part of their broader product suite since late last year. Both are money makers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with notable growth potential. It also examines hedge fund perspectives on these stocks, ranking them from least to most owned based on hedge fund ownership.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA busy retail store showcasing a wide range of consumer electronics.\n\nBest Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nJim Cramer finds it highly satisfying when a stock he supports performs exceptionally well despite being targeted by short sellers. Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY)'s recent sales report exceeded expectations, countering predictions that it might follow in Circuit City's footsteps and struggle against Amazon Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMZN). Cramer notes that Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY)'s results showed an improving trend, with sales picking up towards the end of the quarter.\n\n\"Few things in this business are more satisfying than outsmarting the short sellers who bet against one of your favorite stocks, which then performs remarkably well. That’s how I feel about Best Buy, the Consumer Electronics chain. They reported much better-than-expected sales this morning, defying the naysayers who predicted it would be the next Circuit City, a company destroyed by Amazon.\n\nAfter this excellent quarter, I think it’s all coming together for Best Buy. The quarter showed what’s known as better-than-expected cadence—meaning sales improved towards the end of the period. They even gave a positive guide because August, which was not included in the quarter, was better than July. As CEO Cory Barry confidently stated in a recent conference call, “We delivered strong results in our domestic tablet and computing categories.” These two categories, by the way, contributed 6% to our sales growth, which bodes well for the back-to-school season and the new AI-enabled PCs that will ship in volume this quarter.\n\nEntering the quarter, 6.5% of the float had been sold short because bears believed Best Buy would lower estimates due to its excessive appliance exposure. However, the computing segment of the business outperformed appliances, which had been a drag. Consequently, the stock surged 14%. With this momentum, I believe it can go even higher.\"\n\nBest Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE:BBY) is an appealing investment due to its strong financial performance and favorable outlook. For Q2 2025, Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY) reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.34, beating expectations by $0.18, and revenue of $9.29 billion, which also exceeded forecasts. Although revenue declined from the previous year, Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY) jumped over 17% after the earnings report, signaling positive investor sentiment.\n\nBest Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY) has raised its annual profit forecast, indicating confidence in future growth. Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY)'s commitment to returning value to shareholders is demonstrated by its quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share, which translates to an annual yield of 3.76%. Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY) has a strong track record of increasing its dividend by an average of 18.7% annually over the past three years. Combined with a high return on equity of 47.56% and a manageable debt-to-equity ratio, Best Buy Co. Inc.(NYSE:BBY)'s solid financial health and shareholder focus make it a promising investment opportunity.\n\nOverall BBY ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer's must-watch stocks today. While we acknowledge the potential of BBY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BBY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Prime subscriptions are a big income stream for Amazon and the pressure is always on to get new members.Photograph: Timon Schneider/Alamy\n\nEver since I cancelled my Amazon Prime subscription I have been constantly nagged to sign up again when I check out. The latest pressure tactic is a full-screen display with the sign-up box highlighted, and a pre-ticked box authorising Amazon to use any gift card balance to pay for the subscription. I feel Amazon is trying to trick me into paying up. SM, London\n\nAbout 4.5 million people in the UK have, at some point, signed up to Amazon Prime by mistake, according to research last year by campaign group Which?. I’m one of them. The £95-a-year service offers, among other things, fast-tracked delivery and film and music streaming. Because it’s a healthy cash cow, with more than 200 million subscribers globally, the website prompts between basket and checkout are designed to capture as many customers as possible.\n\nYou had to navigate a full screen in which the most prominent script, in primary colours, offered next-day delivery and invited you to click a bright green button.\n\nIn slightly less eye-catching blue, Amazon claimed it was “giving you another week of Prime for just £0.99”. The white micro-print at the bottom of the page, advising that by clicking the bright button, you are signing up to a rolling £8.99-a-month subscription is easily overlooked by shoppers in a hurry to complete their order, as is the bashful blacked-out box that must be clicked to avoid signing up. For those who do avoid the pitfall, there’s no option to opt out of receiving future prompts to sign up when they make a purchase.\n\nMany shoppers only realise they’ve subscribed when the monthly fee starts leaving their bank account. While sign-up is accomplished with the press of a key, cancellation is a fiddly process involving a Google search and at least four click-throughs.\n\nAmazon, which claims the Which? findings were based on “incorrect assumptions”, tells me: “Customer transparency and trust are top priorities for us and, by design, we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for, or cancel, this membership.”\n\nIt’s illegal under the Consumer Contract Regulations for businesses to pre-tick opt-in boxes for purchases, but it’s up to regulators or the courts to take action.\n\n“Firms are pushing the grey areas of the law to get away with aggressive, opaque sales,” says consumer expert Martyn James. “Amazon, for instance, could argue that, as a customer has a choice of two boxes to click, albeit one that is highlighted, it isn’t breaking the rules. The courts would undoubtedly take a dim view, but it needs a determined complainant to take the issue that far.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is, however, pressure from across the Atlantic. The US Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit that accuses Amazon of using “manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs” to signing millions of consumers to its Prime service without their consent. The trial is due to start next June.\n\nA failsafe way to avoid an unwitting contract is to take your business elsewhere, preferably to a struggling high street, but I know as well as anyone that it’s easier said than done.\n\nEmail your.problems@observer.co.uk.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other fast money stocks.\n\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\n\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\n\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\n\"That’s right. We’re not against rotation; we’re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don’t go down on bad news, we won’t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\n\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\n\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn’t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we’ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it’s really about earnings.\"\n\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\n\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\n\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today’s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today’s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\n\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it’s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed’s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n5G and AI Could be Catalysts of Global Digital Transformation\n\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that “AI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.”  This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\n\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\n\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\n\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

It is one of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers.\n\nAWS provides a variety of solutions tailored for the development and management of 5G networks, including AWS Private 5G, Edge Computing for 5G, and AWS 5G Core Network Solutions. AWS Private 5G is a managed service designed to assist businesses in setting up, managing, and expanding their own private 5G networks on their premises.\n\nIn addition, AWS partners with telecom operators such as Verizon to aid in their 5G deployments. AWS also offers edge computing solutions, including AWS Outposts, which enable telecom providers to deliver computational power directly to businesses.\n\nIn the second quarter, 308 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with total positions worth $65.8 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management is the most significant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $8.46 billion.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing need for cloud computing and data infrastructure, which are crucial for the expansion of 5G networks. As the adoption of 5G technology progresses, there is a rising demand for innovative cloud services and enhanced data processing capabilities, making AWS a key player in this space.\n\nAccording to a media brand, CRN, AWS has a dominant position in the global cloud market, where it had a 31% share in the first quarter. This leadership is supported by the company’s extensive investment in product development, including custom AI chips and advanced software, which supports its growing role in AI cloud services.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its total sales rise by 10% to $148 billion in the second quarter, with projections for the third quarter indicating a growth rate of 8% to 11%. AWS contributed $9.3 billion in operating income for the quarter, accounting for 63% of the company’s total operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that over the past 18 months, AWS has introduced more machine learning and generative AI features than all other major cloud providers combined. Furthermore, the company plans to invest nearly $150 billion in data centers over the next 15 years as it anticipates a surge in demand for AI cloud services.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Could Go Parabolic if the Fed Cuts Rates in September",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a moniker used to collectively describe the world's largest technology businesses -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta, and Tesla.\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the Magnificent Seven is that each business is so diverse and spans so many different end markets that this megacap cohort can shed a lot of light on the overall health of the economy.\n\nInvestors know that two prominent themes of the macro environment over the last couple of years are lingering inflation and high interest rates. But just a couple of days ago at the Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, \"The time has come for policy to adjust.\"\n\nThat sounds like interest rate cuts to me. Should the Fed begin tapering rates, I think there's a good case to be made that each of the Magnificent Seven stocks will continue roaring.\n\nHowever, I see Amazon as the candidate with the most upside. Let's explore how changes in monetary policy could supercharge Amazon and assess why now looks like a lucrative opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nA new spark for e-commerce\n\nAmazon's largest source of revenue stems from its e-commerce marketplace. The table below illustrates annual revenue growth trends related to Amazon's online marketplace over the last year.\n\nCategory Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Online stores 5% 6% 8% 7% 6% Physical stores 7% 6% 4% 6% 4% Third-party seller services 18% 18% 19% 16% 13% Subscription services 14% 13% 13% 11% 11%\n\nData source: Investor Relations.\n\nNotice any patterns? Growth over the last year among physical stores, commissions from third-party sellers, and subscriptions such as Amazon Prime have all decelerated. While sales from online sales have improved modestly, the quarterly results have been pretty inconsistent.\n\nThis shouldn't come across as a surprise, though. Although inflation cooled dramatically in 2023, inflation still lingers. Goods and services are continuing to rise in price, just not as rapidly. When you layer abnormally high inflation with rising interest rates, it's not entirely surprising to see a slowdown in online shopping and subscription services. US Inflation Rate data by YCharts.\n\nIf the Fed does introduce a rate cut in September, I think such a move will be very well received. Even a modest reduction to borrowing costs can go a long way for consumer purchasing power. I think rate cuts will serve as a catalyst for Amazon's e-commerce segment and ignite some newfound growth for the company's largest business.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, I think Amazon's e-commerce partnerships with social media powerhouses look all the more savvy now that rate cuts appear to be drawing closer.\n\nMore investments in artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nEven though Amazon's e-commerce business has faced an uphill battle over the last year, the company has been able to generate growth from other sources. Namely, cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nSimilar to my e-commerce thesis, I think rate cuts will provide corporations of all sizes with some newfound financial flexibility. In turn, AWS looks poised for some acceleration as businesses continue to increase investments in AI applications. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Amazon stock looks primed to thrive right now\n\nFor the trailing 12 months ended June 30, Amazon generated $53 billion of free cash flow -- an increase of 572% year over year. Considering Amazon's total revenue is only growing 10% year over year, it's incredible to see such a significant increase in profitability metrics. AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nOver the last 10 years, Amazon's market capitalization has risen about 1,140%. Over this same time frame, the company's free cash flow has grown roughly fourfold.\n\nAmazon's current price to free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio is 38.9. By comparison, the company's 10-year average P/FCF ratio is about 84. This means that Amazon stock is technically more reasonably priced today than it was a decade ago, despite evolving into a much larger, complex enterprise spanning a multitude of new market opportunities.\n\nTo me, investors are really overlooking Amazon stock right now and not entirely capturing just how quickly the company can mint new levels of profitability. Amazon has managed to grow free cash flow exponentially even during a time of unpredictable sales growth, but I don't think the current valuation fully reflects this dynamic.\n\nWith loads of cash on the balance sheet and the possibility of interest rate cuts looming, I think Amazon's business is about to be supercharged by rejuvenated consumers and corporations alike, and see now as a terrific time to load up on shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with saying, \"Change is the only constant in life.\" Although he lived thousands of years ago, this quote is still relevant today, even in the business world.\n\nIn just the past 40 years, we've seen the business and investing world completely transform, resulting in a changing of the guard of the world's biggest publicly traded companies (by revenue). Here's a look at what has changed over the past four decades.\n\nThe biggest companies in 1984\n\nCompany Revenue in 1984 ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) $88.6 billion General Motors(NYSE: GM) $74.6 billion Mobil $54.6 billion Ford Motor(NYSE: F) $44.5 billion International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) (IBM) $40.2 billion\n\nSource: Fortune 500. Revenue rounded to the nearest 10 million.\n\nThe one aspect that sticks out about that time was the dominance of oil and vehicles. IBM was the leading tech company, but it aside, oil and vehicles were the top dogs in town.\n\nThe biggest companies today\n\nCompany Revenue in the Past Four Quarters Walmart(NYSE: WMT) $657.3 billion Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $604.3 billion Saudi Arabian Oil(SASE: 2222) $495.4 billion Sinopec(SEHK: 386) $473.5 billion PetroChina(NYSE: PTR) $430.7 billion\n\nSource: Fortune 500. Revenue rounded to the nearest 10 million.\n\nThe most noticeable aspect of today's biggest companies is the rise of retail and technology (with Amazon in the sweet spot of the two). Oil continues to be a heavy-hitter because of the globe's dependence, but consumers have shown they appreciate the one-stop-shop nature of companies like Walmart and Amazon.\n\nWalmart has a stronghold on the brick-and-mortar side, and Amazon has revolutionized e-commerce. Will these companies be leading the pact 40 years from now? Only time will tell.

        "title": "3 Billionaire-Held Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "When looking at the top bets of some of the most prominent billionaire investors, there is a common theme that stands out. These professionals are favoring highly profitable companies that dominate their industry. Most importantly, they are investing in the stocks that trade at reasonable valuations relative to future growth expectations.\n\nStephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, and Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors have had successful investing careers, with their net worth ranging from $2.5 billion to $7 billion, according to Forbes. Let's look at these firms' largest holdings at the end of the second quarter and why investors should expect outstanding returns from these stocks over the next few years.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nLone Pine Capital manages over $16 billion in assets. Its largest holding at the end of the second quarter was leading chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also commonly known as TSMC.\n\nTSMC is a widely held tech stock among the most successful investment firms. The company enjoys a lucrative position as the world's top chip foundry. It manufactures chips for Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, and a host of other semiconductor companies and commands over 60% share of the global foundry market.\n\nTSMC gives investors broad exposure to the trends driving growth in the semiconductor industry without the additional risks of picking the winners and losers among the Nvidias and Intels of the world.\n\nTSMC's advantages in advanced chipmaking positions it well for growth as companies invest in powerful chips to handle the demanding workloads of artificial intelligence (AI) training. The demand for high-performance chips drove a 32% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter, and it should continue that momentum into 2025.\n\nManagement expects strong results in the near term driven by improving chip demand for smartphones and AI. Strong top-line growth should pad profits, as TSMC generates a high operating margin of 45% relative to revenue. This will fund the company's plan to spend at least $30 billion this year in capital expenditures to support long-term demand for advanced chip technologies.\n\nWall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 26% over the next several years. With the stock likely to continue trading at its current forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26, investors could earn a return on par with those estimates.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) estimates there are 3.2 billion people that use its family of apps every day. This is a strong advantage in the digital advertising market, which is how the company makes money.\n\nStory continues\n\nChase Coleman's Tiger Global Management has held a large stake in the social media leader since 2018, and it held $3.7 billion worth of shares in the second quarter, making it the firm's largest holding.\n\nMeta AI is already having a big impact on the user experience in Facebook and Instagram. The company's AI models improved the quality of recommendations, which can have a big impact on the time spent on these platforms. As a result, ad impressions and price per ad were up 10% year over year last quarter, and that drove a strong revenue increase of 22% over the year-ago quarter.\n\nStrong revenue growth will provide more profit for Meta to reinvest in advanced AI models and, therefore, keep the positive cycle of growth going. \"We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most-used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta is a highly profitable business. It generated a profit of $51 billion on $149 billion of revenue over the last four quarters. Management plans to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures this year, with a significant increase expected in 2025. This spending will support AI research and other products for long-term growth.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Meta to post annualized earnings growth of 17% in the coming years. Assuming the stock continues to trade at the same P/E, that's enough growth for the shares to double in value within the next five years.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a powerful brand in e-commerce and the enterprise space with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business. It generates most of its $604 billion in trailing 12-month revenue from retail-related services, including advertising, but around two-thirds of its operating profit comes from cloud services.\n\nViking Global Investors held $1.8 billion worth of Amazon stock in Q2, making it the firm's largest holding, and it added significantly to its stake in the quarter.\n\n\"We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\" CEO Andy Jassy said in the second-quarter earnings report. Amazon is benefiting from companies migrating their on-premise data systems to the cloud, and a big incentive for this migration in 2024 is taking advantage of AI services.\n\nAWS revenue increased 19% year over year last quarter, and Amazon should see this momentum continue. Amazon offers tools to help customers build their own AI applications with Amazon Bedrock, in addition to its proprietary AI chips like Trainium, to provide more cost-efficient computing power for AI training.\n\nAmazon's increasing AI capabilities position it well in a cloud market expected to reach $774 billion, according to Statista. Wall Street analysts expect the company's earnings to increase at a 23% annualized rate. Investors should expect the stock to command a premium P/E multiple and hit new highs for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Ark Investment Management operates several private funds as well as multiple public exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in innovative technology stocks. Last year, Ark CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting the companies will generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nSince Wood made that prediction, the Ark Venture Fund has piled into several private AI software companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Ark's ETFs own several AI-related software stocks including Palantir Technologies, UiPath, and Tesla.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be an exciting list of winners over the long term. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. Amazon: A tech giant with multiple AI layers\n\nAmazon might be one of the most diverse AI companies in the world. It's using the technology in its flagship e-commerce business, its advertising business, and, most importantly, its cloud computing segment led by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAI powers the recommendation algorithm on Amazon.com, which learns what each customer likes so it can show them similar products to boost sales. Customers can also use a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus, which is trained on Amazon's product catalog so it can answer questions and offer recommendations. Plus, Amazon just launched a new tool for its fulfillment centers called Project Private Investigator, which uses AI to identify faulty products before they are sent to customers.\n\nBut AWS is home to an even more exciting set of AI initiatives. Not only is Amazon designing its own data center chips to offer developers a more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's hardware, but the tech giant also developed its own family of large language models (LLMs) called Titan. These LLMs are multimodal, which means developers can customize them to create their own generative AI software applications that are capable of generating text, images, and more.\n\nTitan is accessible on the Bedrock platform in AWS, along with LLMs from several leading third-party AI start-ups like Anthropic.\n\nFinally, AWS launched a virtual assistant called Amazon Q last year, which is capable of debugging and generating computer code to accelerate the pace of software development. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says Q is the most capable AI tool of its kind because it has the highest known acceptance rate for code suggestions, and it catches more security vulnerabilities than any competing product.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS alone generated a record $26.2 billion in revenue during the recent second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which was a 19% increase from the year-ago period. It marked the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, thanks in large part to demand for AI. Amazon is one of the most attractively valued members of the trillion-dollar club, and if Cathie Wood is right, its stock could deliver spectacular returns for investors in the coming years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms: A social media giant with an AI twist\n\nMeta is the parent company of popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Together, they serve more than 3.2 billion people every single day, and AI is playing an increasingly important role in the user experience.\n\nFacebook and Instagram, for example, have evolved from social networks into entertainment platforms, with AI-powered algorithms showing each user the most relevant posts, even if they weren't shared by someone they know. This is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's family of apps, which means they view more ads and drive more revenue for the tech giant.\n\nMeta continues to deliver new innovations for its advertisers, too. They can use AI to create engaging text and image content for their ads, which is great for businesses that don't have an in-house marketing team. But the process will become even easier over time. Eventually, businesses will be able to tell Meta their advertising budget and their objective, and its AI engine will autonomously handle everything from crafting the ad to selecting the target audience.\n\nMeta also developed its own open-source LLM called Llama. It just launched Llama 3.1, the most advanced version so far, with 405 billion parameters. The company says it's already competitive with most other leading models, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg is already focusing on Llama 4, which he says will set the bar for the industry next year. Llama is at the foundation of many AI features in Meta's pipeline, so it's key to the company's strategy.\n\nMeta AI is one of those features. It's a user-facing AI assistant, which is now accessible in the chat and search functions across all of the company's apps. It can accurately answer questions on a broad range of topics, and it can be prompted to generate text and image content. It also lays the groundwork for Business AI, which could be a big revenue driver for Meta in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent capable of handling customer queries and even processing sales.\n\nMeta stock is trading near an all-time high right now, but it's still attractively valued relative to its big-tech peers. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 26.7 as of this writing, which is about 17% cheaper than the 32 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. Given the P/E discount, this could be a great entry point for long-term investors, especially if Cathie Wood proves to be right.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\n\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy's warning to Nvidia shareholders\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\n\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\n\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\n\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley believes custom silicon will become increasingly popular\n\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\n\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2029",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence rockstar Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.9 trillion, but the chipmaker has flitted back and forth around $3 trillion for several months. Only two other publicly traded U.S. companies have crossed that threshold: Apple and Microsoft.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) could surpass Nvidia's current valuation to become $3 trillion companies by 2029. What that means for shareholders is detailed below.\n\nAmazon currently has a market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. Reaching $3 trillion by 2029 implies a total return of 58%, which equates to 10.7% annually over the next 4.5 years. Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Reaching $3 trillion by 2029 implies a total return of 50%, which equates to 9.4% annually over the next 4.5 years.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Alphabet.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has three important growth engines in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Specifically, it runs the most popular online marketplace in the U.S. in terms of visitors, and it accounts for 41% of domestic retail e-commerce sales. The company also has a vast logistics network that supports fulfillment services for sellers and rapid delivery for buyers, which reinforces its leadership position.\n\nAmazon is the third-largest ad tech company in the world, but it dominates retail media, a term that refers to digital advertising services provided by retailers. That matters because retail media is one of the fastest-growing verticals in the digital ad market, according to eMarketer. Additionally, Amazon recently unlocked a new revenue stream by introducing advertising on Prime Video.\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud, and its market share rose one point to 32% in the June quarter. Those share gains reflect aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) services. \"During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined,\" CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts.\n\nGoing forward, eMarketer estimates U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow at 9% annually through 2028, while retail media spending climbs at 24% annually during the same period. Meanwhile, the International Data Corp. (IDC) expects public cloud spending to compound at 19% annually through 2028. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth over the next 4.5 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's how that could earn Amazon a $3 trillion valuation by 2029: Today, the company is worth $1.9 trillion. Revenue could reasonably increase at 12% annually through the end of 2028, in which case the company would hit $3 trillion in market value if shares traded at 3 times sales, a slight discount to its current valuation of 3.1 times sales.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has two important growth engines in digital advertising and cloud computing. The company owns six products that serve more than two billion monthly users. Chief among them are the most popular streaming video platform (YouTube) and leading internet search engine (Google Search). Those platforms let Alphabet efficiently collect information and deliver data-driven advertising to consumers.\n\nAlphabet will account for 27.4% of global digital ad spending this year, per eMarketer. That puts the company more than five percentage points ahead of Meta Platforms, the second largest digital advertiser in the world. Importantly, while Alphabet is losing share across the open internet, dominance in internet search and streaming video should keep it ahead of the competition for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud is the third-largest public cloud, and its market share increase one point to 12% over the past year. Those share gains reflect its status as a leader in AI infrastructure solutions and large language models. \"Year to date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues, and are being used by more than 2 million developers,\" CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on the second-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoing forward, eMarketer estimates global digital ad spending will grow at 10% annually through 2028, and the IDC expects public cloud spending to compound at 19% annually during the same period. That gives Alphabet a good shot at double-digit revenue growth over the next 4.5 years, with potential upside from its subsidiary Waymo, a company that operates an autonomous ride-hailing network in several U.S. cities.\n\nHere's how that could earn Alphabet a $3 trillion valuation by 2029. The company currently has a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Revenue could reasonably grow at 10% annually through the end of 2028, in which case the company would hit $3 trillion in market value if shares traded at 6 times sales, a modest discount to its current valuation of 6.4 times sales.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds detail throughout on recovery of indexes, rallies in Nvidia and other stocks)\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 29 (Reuters) -\n\nThe Nasdaq reached a record high close on Thursday for the first time in over two years, its latest rally propelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence, particularly Nvidia and other heavyweight tech stocks.\n\nThe Nasdaq advanced 144.18 points, or 0.90%, to 16,091.92, beating its Nov. 19, 2021 record high close of 16,057.44.\n\nInvestor euphoria around AI has made Nvidia Wall Street's most widely traded company, replacing Tesla.\n\n\"The anticipation of an artificial intelligence boom has really provided support for these stocks even at extended valuations. It's led to the best performing ones really exceeding what most people thought was possible just a year ago,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\n\"For it to continue I think you'd need move past the idea of artificial intelligence as a revolution and begin to see revenue growth directly attributable to it.\"\n\nThe tech-heavy index began its latest rally after its closing low in December 2022, which was down more than 30% from its November 2021 record high as investors worried about inflation and rising interest rates dumped growth stocks with high valuations.\n\nThe Nasdaq is the last of Wall Street's three major stock indexes to reach a record high close. After selloffs through most of 2022, the S&P 500 has now hit a string of record highs since late January, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to record highs in late 2023.\n\nMuch of the Nasdaq's recovery in recent months has been fueled by optimism the Federal Reserve will soon begin cutting interest rates along with the AI-related tech euphoria.\n\nNvidia has surged 60% so far this year and this month eclipsed Amazon and Alphabet to become Wall Street's\n\nthird most valuable\n\ncompany, with a market capitalization of $1.94 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, another major AI winner, has gained 10% in valuation to $3.03 trillion in 2024, replacing Apple as the world's most valuable company.\n\nNvidia rose 1.9% on Thursday after jumping last week following a forecast of a roughly three-fold surge in quarterly revenue.\n\nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both up about 7% in 2024.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York and Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif.; Editing by Chris Reese and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Feb 29 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, helped by the artificial intelligence boom and a recovery in the personal computer (PC) market.\n\nThe PC market is showing signs of green shoots following a slowdown in revenue that began in 2022 from the peaks touched during the pandemic, as the boom in work-from-home demand for PCs and electronics faded.\n\nDell is also a beneficiary of rising demand for its AI-servers that are equipped with chip designer Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which helps in meeting the demands of high-performance computing.\n\n\"Our strong AI-optimized server momentum continues, with orders increasing nearly 40% sequentially and backlog nearly doubling, exiting our fiscal year at $2.9 billion,\" Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in a statement.\n\nLast week, Lenovo Group reported stronger-than-expected earnings in the third quarter, with revenue returning to growth after five quarters of decline.\n\nThe global PC market returned to 3% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is now poised for a stronger recovery in 2024, data research firm Canalys said in January.\n\nDell posted revenue of $22.32 billion for the quarter ended Feb. 2, slightly ahead of analysts' average estimates of $22.16 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nRevenue at the infrastructure solutions group, which includes its storage, software and server offerings, fell about 6% to $9.33 billion, while that of the client solutions group - home to PCs - fell nearly 12% to $11.72 billion.

        "content": "Earnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn’t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares couldn’t hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA’s quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s top line trajectory is visibly bullish, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Those and other technology companies have been at the heart of a Wall Street rally in recent months, fueled by optimism about artificial intelligence.\n\nDell Technologies, which sells AI-optimized servers made with Nvidia's high-end processors, rose 1.2% ahead of its report after the bell.\n\nTraders added to bets that the Fed will cut rates in June after a Commerce Department report showed U.S. prices picked up in January in line with expectations amid strong gains in the costs of services, while the annual increase in inflation was the smallest in three years.\n\n\"It's not a dramatic decline, but inflation is moving in the right direction and that gives investors a little bit of cover to feel a little bit confident about stepping into the stock market,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth.\n\nAtlanta Fed President and voting member Raphael Bostic stressed taking data-dependent approach to monetary policy, saying it was going to be a bumpy path to the Fed's 2% inflation target.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he believed there was still room for increases in labor supply to bring down inflation further.\n\nReports on consumer and producer prices earlier in February, which signaled sticky inflation, had led investors to push back expectations of rate cuts to June. At the beginning of this year, traders were betting on March as the starting point for the Fed's easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, initial jobless claims for the week ended Feb. 24 stood at 215,000, greater than expectations of 210,000, economists polled by Reuters said.\n\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.34% at 5,087.08 points.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.62% to 16,046.38 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.07% at 38,923.00 points.\n\nWith February nearly over, all three major Wall Street indexes were on track for their fourth straight monthly advance, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq in the lead, thanks to robust quarterly earnings and optimism around AI.\n\nOf the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, eight rose, led by real estate, up 1.21%, followed by a 0.82% gain in information technology.\n\nKeeping the Dow in negative territory, Boeing fell 1.8% after a report of a probe by the Department of Justice.\n\nSnowflake slumped nearly 20% after the cloud data analytics company forecast first-quarter product revenue below Wall Street estimates and said CEO Frank Slootman was retiring.\n\nParamount Global climbed about 1% after the media conglomerate posted a surprise profit on streaming gains.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on a bill to avert a partial government shutdown.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 1.9-to-one ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 56 new highs and one new low. The Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and 48 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru, and by Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif.; Additional reporting by Johann M Cherian; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Shounak Dasgupta, Maju Samuel and Richard Chang)",

        "content": "While the equities sector roars higher, it’s never a bad idea to consider stocks to buy for a down market. No, I’m not prognosticating an imminent calamity. Rather, I just think it’s smart to think ahead.\n\nEssentially, stocks to buy for a down market is Wall Street’s equivalent of an emergency kit. You do have one of those, don’t you? Because if you don’t, you should get one. Sure, it might seem like a waste of time and money, especially if an emergency doesn’t materialize. But that’s the thing – unexpected calamities have a way of being, you know, unexpected.\n\nSimilarly, I don’t think you’re going to get uber-rich with these stocks to buy for a down market. However, should the red ink start flying, you’re going to sleep easier buying these giants on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is now a more streamlined operation, having spun off its consumer health products division. While I have some reservations about the move, in the long run, it may unlock value for stakeholders prior to the spinoff. Looking ahead, though, J&J itself should benefit from rising permanent demand.\n\nAccording to Acumen Research and Consulting, the global pharmaceutical market reached a valuation of $1.5 trillion in 2022. Analysts anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2023 to 2032. At the forecast’s culmination point, the industry should be worth $2.8 trillion.\n\nAnother factor benefiting JNJ as one of the stocks to buy for a down market is the value proposition. Even without a downcycle, shares trade at a modest trailing-year earnings multiple of 13.29X. If the red ink starts flying, JNJ should be more attractive.\n\nAnalysts view the company as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.67 price target, implying 10% upside potential.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nA soft-drink giant, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) makes for an ideal play for stocks to buy for a down market because of everyday relevance. Recently, a few major enterprises have demanded an ultimatum regarding work from home: either come back to the office or kiss your job goodbye. With this sharp pivot from the pandemic days, demand for caffeinated products should rise.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have struggled with years of high inflation and spiked borrowing costs. People are still opening their wallets but many sectors have indicated concerns about waning capabilities. So, demand for expensive coffeeshops might fade. Cynically, the trade-down effect should benefit KO stock. The underlying product is cheap (and necessary), thus offering a superior alternative.\n\nTo be sure, KO isn’t exactly a sterling deal on paper. Nevertheless, it offers a forward dividend yield of 3.21%, combined with a payout increase going on 63 years. If you’re looking for stocks to buy for a down market, it doesn’t get much more trustworthy than Coca-Cola.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOrdinarily, I might go with another big-box retailer other than Target (NYSE:TGT) for stocks to buy for a down market. Yeah, I’m talking about Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, Walmart seems more capable of withstanding a wider economic hit. Based on the latest consumer demographic data, Walmart shoppers tend to align with realistic income brackets.\n\nOn the other hand, Target tends to align with consumers within higher income levels. Nevertheless, they both provide one-stop shopping experiences that allow them to stay relevant in the age of e-commerce. Further, what I appreciate about TGT stock specifically is that it’s more “technically” undervalued than WMT. The former security is up about 6% on a year-to-date basis while the latter gained over 12%.\n\nAlso, I can’t overlook the better value proposition in terms of passive income. Right now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.91%. On the other hand, WMT is comparatively miserly with a yield of 1.39%. Analysts rate Target a consensus strong buy, which seems reasonable.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nA similar investment to Target and Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) should also be on your radar for stocks to buy for a down market. Fundamentally, I appreciate COST stock for its viable consumer demographics. The main takeaway is that shoppers tend to be younger and more upwardly mobile. In other words, Costco’s demo indicates that it starts at a high point and is only rising.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint – especially in a segment that overlaps with the broader discretionary retail space – I don’t think you can ask for much better. Now, here’s the thing with COST stock: I wouldn’t buy it at this juncture. Rather, if the market gives you a sizable dip because of some disastrous economic event, Costco is a name to pick up on the cheap.\n\nSome ideas you simply don’t trust when the red stains emerge. That’s because their questionable business models become even more suspect under sever economic duress. But Costco? The retailer has weathered multiple storms. Further, it enjoys natural insulation because of its educated, higher-wage-earning members.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWhen it comes to stocks to buy for a down market, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is an “OG” stock. That’s slang for “original gangster” or “gangsta” if you’re really cool. Basically, Big Blue is an authentic, old-school technology investment. While everybody’s been going gaga over enterprises like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for facilitating artificial intelligence, IBM has been doing AI since most of you were born.\n\nAfter years of languishing in the shadows, it appears that the legacy tech juggernaut is finally receiving some dues. It’s not enough. However, I’m sure long-embattled stakeholders will take a 15% pop to start 2024. Also, in the past 52 weeks, IBM stock gained almost 45%.\n\nIf you peruse IBM-related stories on InvestorPlace, I’ve been pounding my fist on the table for a reason. While other companies may be playing cute games with digital intelligence, IBM has been forwarding real solutions. So, I trust that if heaven forbid a severe downturn impacts the market, I can trust Big Blue on any dips.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother major tech giant with a long history, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the contemporary beneficiaries of the AI boon. Since the start of January, MSFT stock gained just under 10% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it shot up almost 66%. With everyone still head over heels regarding digital intelligence, Microsoft may continue to rise.\n\nHowever, if the market suffers some indigestion, MSFT would easily rank among the stocks to buy for a down market. It’s not just about the AI investments, which has proven fruitful. However, the utility of generative AI is questionable at this moment. What’s not questionable? Microsoft’s dominance in most other areas of productive technologies.\n\nFor example, the business world might implode without Microsoft’s suite of office products. Programs like Word and Excel – though they do have their quirks and issues – remain indispensable. Further, the company dominates the PC operating system market environment.\n\nIf you want to draw some cute pictures, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be a better bet. For everything else, there’s Microsoft. It’s a strong buy for a reason.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be 100% clear, if you’re looking for a discounted opportunity, buying tech and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) right now is a tricky proposition. Just at a glance, you’re talking about a security that’s traded at a near-60X trailing-year earnings multiple. Not only that, the forward earnings multiple isn’t that much better at 41X. Still, if the red ink starts flying, AMZN should be on your watch list.\n\nIt’s real simple: the company has reached a knowledge-saturation point where it’s likely impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. With Amazon users enjoying the everyday convenience of product and food delivery, less incentive exists to shop in person. More than that, the company’s controversial role as the vacuum cleaner of small businesses everywhere has succeeded in one critical element: fostering effective economies of scale.\n\nThat might help to explain why even in an ecosystem impacted by stubbornly high inflation and interest rates, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales continues to rise since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense until you realize the (evil) genius behind Amazon. Clearly, it’s one of the stocks to buy for a down market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Its a Bull Market You Know: Top Ranked Stocks to Ride the Trend",
        "content": "This article’s title, “It’s a bull market you know!” is a quote from a famous investing book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, which accounts the life of famous speculator Jesse Livermore.\n\nThe book, which is a must read for any stock trader, details the wins and losses of Livermore’s volatile life and shares many of his formative learning experiences. One of his earlier lessons occurred while he was hanging out at a brokerage firm he traded with. There he met a market veteran who went by the name Old Turkey.\n\nUp until this period Livermore was a very active trader, buying and selling shares at a high frequency, sometimes multiple times during the day. But this phrase from Old Turkey “It’s a bull market you know!” stuck with Livermore.\n\nOld Turkey would repeat it over and while at first, he thought it was just a platitude he learned that it held much deeper insights than that. Instead of trading in and out of stocks, taking profits and waiting for a dip to buy again, this phrase was an encouragement to hold on to you winners for as long as possible.\n\nPersisting Bull Market\n\nBull markets often endure much longer than investors expect. In fact, the US stock market spends the vast majority of time in bull markets that steadily grind higher, climbing a wall of worry.\n\nThis insight deeply changed the way Livermore approached the market. Instead of quick profits he now focused on the big trends and owning the leading stocks for as long as the bull market persisted.\n\nAlthough Livermore’s trading was marked by wild boom and busts, it was his overuse of leverage that was his Achilles heel. In fact, he would make huge profits riding these longer-term bull moves and occasional bear markets. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday’s Market\n\nThe current market regime is one that has a litany of bullish tailwinds, and we are likely closer to the beginning of this bull market than the end. The factors include:\n\n-          AI revolution: The hype is real – AI tech could be as influential as the internet has been and will make major contributions to productivity gains.\n\nStory continues\n\n-          Strong economic growth: The US economy is showing above trend growth surprising nearly all economists on wall street.\n\n-          Interest rate cuts: It won’t be long before the Fed begins to lower rates again, beginning the expansionary cycle again.\n\nLeading Stocks\n\nOften, as a stock makes incredible gains, you will hear very loud voices talking about how “it has gone too far!” Just look at the commentary surrounding Nvidia NVDA, these traders have been saying this month after month, yet the stock pushes higher.\n\nLeading stocks lead for a reason, and in this current market they are leading because of growing sales and earnings. That is the opposite of hype and exactly what you want to see strong stocks do.\n\nAfter a little more than a year of using the Zacks Rank I have been continuously impressed by its ability to pick big winners. Nvidia and Meta Platforms META sat on the list for the majority of 2023, when most analysts doubted them, yet they were the biggest winners in the S&P 500.\n\nThere are a handful of stocks sitting on the Zacks Rank right now that have performed very well recently and I think are likely to continue. They represent the secular economic trends of this economy, have strong business models, growing earnings and of course top Zacks Ranks.\n\nMeta Platforms and Nvidia are still on the top of the list, and both enjoy Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) ratings reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. EPS for Nvidia are forecast to grow an incredible 30% annually for the next 3-5 years and Meta’s are projected to climb 20% annually over the same period.\n\nThey also continue to show impressive relative strength against the market YTD. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAnother company that is quietly making a significant contribution to the semiconductor and AI industry is Cadence Design Systems CDNS. The company builds software for designing chips and leads the space.\n\nSoftware within the semiconductor industry is a particularly appealing vertical. Semiconductor production is a very high capex intensive business, while software is a high margin low capex business. Candence Design enjoys gross margins of 90% and net margins of 26%.\n\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, CDNS also has a compelling technical trade setup. The price action of the stock has been forming a bullish consolidation, and a breakout should send the stock higher. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAmazon AMZN is another leader that is likely to continue to lead. Both the ecommerce business and cloud services boast massive tailwinds with the expansion of online retail and digital transformation. Amazon web services dominates the cloud industry with 31% of the market share.\n\nAdditionally, its advertising business has exploded from seemingly nowhere and now contributes $60 billion a year to the top line annually. The emergence of this business shows that Amazon continues to execute at a high level as it enters new highly competitive industries. Statista\n\nImage Source: Statista\n\nAmazon also has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Earnings estimates are being upgraded significantly and EPS are expected to grow at a very high pace over the next 3-5 years. Earnings are projected to grow 28% annually over that time. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere will be hiccups along the way, 5% and 10% corrections as the market continues higher, but don’t let the bears scare you out of this market.\n\nIt’s a bull market you know!\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have more than doubled off an October low.\n\nThe company is seen as one of the primary beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, and last month, optimism about new AI processors helped AMD shares recover from a weak forecast.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Citigroup Inc. wrote that it remains “wildly bullish on semis,” especially as “the AI market continues to grow” with all kinds of businesses and organizations all buying AI chips. The firm singled out AMD as one of the stocks it favors, along with Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc.\n\nStill, the stock doesn’t exactly look like a bargain after recent gains. Shares trade at nearly 50 times estimated earnings, making it far more expensive than industry leader Nvidia, whose multiple is a relatively milder 32 times.\n\nWhile analysts are broadly positive — more than three-fourths of the firms tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying AMD — shares are just 2% below the average price target, suggesting additional upside from here could be limited.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Why Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Is Trading Lower Today",
        "content": "Why Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Is Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of data warehouse-as-a-service Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) fell 24.9% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided product guidance for Q1, which missed analysts' estimates. In addition, net revenue retention continued to decline. Snowflake attributed some of the challenges to significant holiday impacts in December and January, a recurring challenge for predicting consumption patterns. Consequently, understanding consumption trends proved difficult, with trends yet to revert to pre-FY'24 levels. As a result, these concerns were baked into the product growth guidance, with management expecting \"increased revenue headwinds associated with product efficiency gains, tiered storage pricing, and the expectation that some of our customers will leverage Iceberg Tables for their storage.\"\n\nAnother significant negative that is adding to the stock's weakness is the announcement of CEO Frank Slootman's retirement. Slootman is a highly-respected tech executive who guided Snowflake through its public offering. Before that, he was CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), a company he also shepherded through the IPO process. On the other hand, Snowflake delivered strong free cash flow while still growing revenue at 30%+, which is certainly an impressive feat.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snowflake? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnowflake's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 25 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snowflake and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago, when the company dropped 5.3% as equities pulled back, with market participants likely taking profits ahead of a big earnings week. Tech stocks led the decline, with the Nasdaq index down 1% while the SP 500 fell 0.5%. Some of the notable stocks reporting earnings during the week include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks have had a good run since the fourth quarter of 2023 as markets expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024 amidst cooling inflation data. The market's momentum continued into the early weeks of 2024 following solid earnings results from big tech names, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nSnowflake is down 1.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $186.11 per share it is trading 21.1% below its 52-week high of $236 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snowflake's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $732.17.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "(Add comment from Figure CEO, paragraphs 5-6, funding background, paragraph 8)\n\nBy Harshita Mary Varghese and Krystal Hu\n\nFeb 29 (Reuters) - Robotics startup Figure said on Thursday it raised $675 million in a funding round from investors including Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos at a valuation of $2.6 billion.\n\nSunnyvale, California-based Figure also said it signed a collaboration with OpenAI to develop generative artificial intelligence for its humanoid robots.\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI has generated interest in AI, with companies investing million of dollars to cash in on the trend.\n\nOther companies involved in the Figure funding include OpenAI Startup Fund, Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, Parkway Venture Capital, Intel Capital, Align Ventures and ARK Invest.\n\nBrett Adcock, Figure's founder and CEO, said the company will use the funding to develop large language models for robotics, ramp up manufacturing and hire more people.\n\nThe startup will also move to Microsoft Azure for AI infrastructure and training, Adcock said.\n\nThe AI models Figure develops will be based on OpenAI's latest GPT models, and specifically trained on robotics actions data that Figure has collected so that its humanoid robots can talk with people, see things and perform physical tasks, according to Adcock.\n\n\"We've always planned to come back to robotics and we see a path with Figure to explore what humanoid robots can achieve when powered by highly capable multimodal models,\" said Peter Welinder, vice president of product and partnerships at OpenAI.\n\nHumanoid robots have raised renewed interest from investors as AI-powered software offers more possibilities of how robots interact and work with human. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk predicted a billion humanoid robots on Earth in the 2040s, as the electric carmaker released its latest humanoid Optimus Gen in development.\n\nBloomberg first reported last week about Figure raising funding and said that Bezos had committed $100 million through his firm Explore Investments LLC and Microsoft is investing $95 million, while Nvidia and an Amazon-affiliated fund are each providing $50 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, Figure signed a partnership with BMW Manufacturing to deploy its humanoid robots in the car maker's facility in the United States.\n\nFigure raised $70 million from investors led by Parkway Venture Capital in its first external round last year.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru and Krystal Hu in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Niket Nishant; Editing by Maju Samuel and Will Dunham)",

        "title": "Nano-X Imaging Could Be Teaming Up With Nvidia, and Its Stock Is Flying. Can It Continue?",
        "content": "According to a recent regulatory filing, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) now owns a stake in Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX), a small Israeli medical device company that makes X-ray machines. While the investment was modest, that didn't prevent investors from reacting ebulliently to the news -- Nano-X's shares skyrocketed more than 50% the following day.\n\nDoes Nvidia's involvement have the potential to be transformative for the smaller business, and is it possible that there's more upside in store for shareholders? Or is the market missing something?\n\nA collaboration could be big, if it actually exists\n\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia's shares of Nano-X are worth a grand total of $379,856, which is just a smidgen in comparison to its market cap of around $572 million. So at first glance, it looks like the market is massively overreacting since it's difficult to imagine precisely what the company could even do with such a small investment. Still, appreciating the context is key to understanding why the market isn't entirely over the top with its aggressive bidding.\n\nIn case you aren't familiar, Nano-X's business model is a bit unique. Rather than manufacture its low-cost X-ray machines and sell them to customers, it doles out hardware with the goal of capturing revenue each time a customer performs a scan. In the U.S., each scan costs on the order of $30, but it's likely cheaper elsewhere. The company has also decided to experiment with its model somewhat in the U.S., where it charges customers a small amount for equipment and installation as well as for scans.\n\nThe advantage of this model is that the business can access a much larger market -- many healthcare systems in developing countries and rural areas of the U.S. could certainly make use of an X-ray machine, but they often lack the capital to buy them.\n\nRecognizing that its target customers are unlikely to have many spare radiologists if they don't already have basic imaging technology on hand, the company is also developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems and human-provided teleradiology services to remotely analyze the images generated by its hardware.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat could be one explanation for Nvidia's interest as the company is keen to invest in many different AI applications. Pairing Nvidia's acumen with AI together with Nano-X's widely distributed scanning hardware -- if that's what the two companies have in mind -- could thus be beneficial for both organizations, especially if it allows Nano-X to one day offer a product that eliminates the need for radiologists entirely. Neither company has made any comment.\n\nIn 2017, Nvidia invested in another Israeli company, Zebra Medical, which was focused on using AI for interpreting scan imagery. Then in 2021, Nano-X purchased Zebra Medical using its stock, so Nvidia received its shares. It's very possible that the only reason it reported its stake in February was that the size of its investment portfolio grew to be worth more than $100 million, which is the cutoff after which it'd be required to make a regulatory filing.\n\nConsider circling back in a few quarters\n\nNvidia is a powerful company, but it isn't yet a kingmaker, at least not in the medical device industry. It's true that Nano-X could stand to increase the size of its addressable market by bolstering its offerings with Nvidia's AI capabilities if that were to take place. But that elides a more significant issue for investors, namely that Nano-X has not proven its business model is actually viable.\n\nWhile the Nanox.Arc, its x-ray platform, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), its commercial global launch has been much slower than anticipated. According to the Q3 report, its quarterly revenue of $2.5 million in 2023 was barely higher than 2022's haul of $2.4 million in the same quarter.\n\nWhat's more, $2.2 million of its third-quarter revenue was from its teleradiology services, as was all of its revenue a year prior. Only $99,000 was derived from equipment sales and installation fees. Likewise, while its AI solution for analyzing scans of people's livers has the stamp of regulatory approval, it has not driven faster revenue growth yet either.\n\nIn other words, this business is not yet profitable or self-sustaining, and so it is a risky investment. Without the core economic proposition validated -- that it can make more money on scans than it costs to produce and install the scanning hardware -- it's hard to be enthusiastic about investing.\n\nNonetheless, if over the next few quarters Nano-X's scan revenue growth starts to accelerate sharply -- and there is a good chance it will based on its growing sales force and recent agreements with medical device makers -- shareholders who started a position will probably get wealthier.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nano-X Imaging right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nano-X Imaging, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nano-X Imaging wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's 10 New Stock Picks Before March 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 New Stock Picks for March 2024.\n\nJim Cramer during his February 28 program on CNBC said that as we near the end of the earnings season he's been thinking about the effect of earnings reports on the markets and how these reports and their coverage in the news often cause average investors to make \"snap\" decisions what later turn out to be wrong decisions. Cramer said these reports have programmed us to think short term and ignore the long-term picture or \"nuance.\" Cramer said that the \"way we report on stocks\" is \"not working anymore.\"\n\nCramer is Upset About Earnings News Coverage\n\nCramer gave examples of Home Depot and Lowe's, which recently reported their quarters. Cramer said these two companies are excellent businesses and their quarters were strong but because of the \"beat and raise\" structure of earnings news stories many investors immediately started selling these two stocks after reading news headlines without waiting for conference calls to understand the big picture and future guidance.\n\nCramer said Home Depot shares jumped after the company's earnings call because the management said it feels good about inventories since they were lower than the previous levels at the end of 2023. Cramer said that's what investors wanted to hear and that's why one should not make decisions based on news stories and instead wait for conference calls and details from companies' management. Jim Cramer's New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during the last week of February and picked 10 stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Instead of companies like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been recommending for a long time, you will see some new names in the list of Cramer's stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer recently said in his Lightning Round program that his next Nvidia play stock would be Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY).\n\n\"I think Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is my next one because that's a mention by Nvidia.\"\n\nJim Cramer was talking about SoundHound AI and why he likes the stock because of the Nvidia factor.\n\nDuring its earnings call in November 2023, Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) management talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"So with that as a backdrop, I’d like to highlight some of the progress we’ve made within the quarter. In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people. It also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service. Last but certainly not least, the service and all of its outputs come with Getty Images uncapped indemnification. In terms of the economics, customers pay to generate versus download, which better aligns to our costs and recognize the value of ideation. Initial customer feedback and engagement with the service has been really positive and we have already introduced new features to the service such as being able to prompt in over 70 languages. And we’re engaged with a limited set of customers to custom-train models to their IP and brand needs.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). Cramer is bullish on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) because of the Nvidia factor. Cramer said \"that's Nvidia play\" while talking about SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nSoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) has gained about 204% year to date. The stock is roaring after Nvidia revealed a $3.7 million stake in the company while SoftBank bought 1.1 million shares of SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) makes voice AI solutions for automotive, restaurants and hospitality industries.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 13 hedge funds had stakes in SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\n8. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recommended in his Lightning Round program on CNBC this week. Cramer said Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock is down \"on an opportunity.\" Cramer quoted Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) skeptics who say there is a lot of oversaturation in the market for self-storage companies. Cramer said in response to these naysayers:\n\n\"Give me a break. These guys are very smart operators. I want to buy the stock.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). The biggest stakeholder of the company during this period was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which owns a $221 million stake.\n\nIn addition to PSA, Cramer is also recommending  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”\n\n7. DigitalBridge Group Inc (NYSE:DBRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG), which he said was once a REIT but later transformed into a \"profitable global alternative asset manager.\" Jim Cramer said he remembers DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) from its REIT days and wanted the company to do exactly what it's doing today. Jim Cramer said DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is a \"good stock\" and praised the caller for making the right call on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG). The most notable stake in the company is owned by Charles Akre's Akre Capital Management which owns a $77 million stake in the company.\n\nAve Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) started its life with particularly complicated financials as the two data center businesses it owned directly obfuscated the economics of its asset management business. However, DigitalBridge plans to divest enough of their ownership in these two businesses that they will no longer be required to consolidate them in their reported financials. Consequently, its reported financials will be much simpler to analyze and reflect the profile of a pure-play alternative asset manager. DigitalBridge differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on digital infrastructure, an asset class that institutional allocators are severely under allocated to. DigitalBridge is actively fundraising for its third flagship investment fund. With an expected 11-year fund life, this fund could generate fees for the company and its investors for a long time.\n\nWe are confident that these three alternative investment managers will grow their respective businesses substantially over the next five years. This should provide ample growth in their stock prices and, consequently, the Fund’s positions in them.”\n\n6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during his \"Lightning Round\" program on CNBC. Cramer said Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of his \"absolute favorite stocks.\" Jim Cramer said that there's \"such a fantastic narrative there.\"\n\n\"You must hold on to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET).\"\n\nJim Cramer also recommended investors to buy more Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) if the stock takes a hit.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 5 New Stock Picks for March 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nWall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets 10 Stocks with 50% Upside Potential According to Analysts 12 Extreme Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "You may be short-sighted if you think generative artificial intelligence is the best thing happening to technology stocks this decade. There also are great opportunities right now in A-rated quantum computing stocks.\n\nQuantum computing will surely change the computer industry as we know it. It will be the next great breakthrough in technology. Quantum computing uses computer hardware and algorithms to use quantum mechanics to solve problems that classic computers can’t touch.\n\nSimply put, classic computers operate on chips that use bits for computations. The bits can show either a value of zero or one and a combination of zeros and ones used to complete tasks in modern computers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut quantum computers operate at subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. Quantum bits allow these particles to exist in more than one state (zero or one) simultaneously, greatly increasing processing speeds.\n\nQuantum hardware is relatively new (roughly three decades) but we’re just now starting to see some inroads in everyday computing. According to a Zapata survey, more than two-thirds of companies with revenues of $250 million and computing budgets of at least $1 million are spending more than $1 million yearly to develop quantum computing applications.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader analyzed quantum computing stocks with the best fundamentals, earnings performance and momentum today. These are the best of the best A-rated quantum computing stocks to buy.\n\nHere are seven that all get “A” ratings in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is perhaps the most established of the quantum computing companies.\n\nIn 2016 it put the first quantum processor on the cloud, which made it possible for anyone to run experiments. In 2019, it launched the first circuit-based commercial quantum computer, the Quantum System One.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe innovations keep coming. Its first universal quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits rolled out in 2023, as well as new modular quantum processors.\n\nIn December it announced Quantum System Two, its first modular quantum computer that it calls “the cornerstone of IBM’s quantum-centric supercomputing architecture.”\n\nIBM has deep pockets for this research, which will surely continue to pay off down the road. The company has a market cap of nearly $170 billion and more than $13 billion of cash on hand to pour into research. And the stock is doing well, up 42% in the last year on the strength of $17.4 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago.\n\nIBM stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets a lot of publicity and credit for its work in generative AI and its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. But its work with quantum computing is equally impressive.\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure Quantum is a cloud service that allows users to build and refine quantum algorithms. It includes tools to accelerate scientific discovery, as well as to use natural language to work through chemistry and materials sciences problems.\n\nMicrosoft’s advanced work with AI is notable when you consider the potential of quantum computing. As Forbes writes, “Quantum computing, an entirely new way of processing information, when combined with AI, has the potential, without exaggeration, to bring about a new computing revolution. Transformation may be an understatement.”\n\nMSFT stock is up 60% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) already is staking its claim as the most influential stock of the decade. NVDA stock is up 238% in the last year as the company closes in on the $2 trillion mark in market capitalization.\n\nWhile Nvidia is known for its powerful graphics processing units that make generative AI possible, the company also has its Cuda Quantum platform, a first-of-its-kind open-source platform that allows developers to integrate and program quantum processing units, GPUs, and central processing units (CPUs) into a single system.\n\nIt’s impossible to ignore Nvidia’s efforts in quantum computing when you consider its massive success in creating the technology to power generative AI. Nvidia’s revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter was $22.1 billion, up 265% from a year ago, and the company brought in $60.9 billion in revenue for the full year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is making some impressive gains this year up 20% so far in 2024 and 128% in the last 12 months as it finally starts competing with Nvidia in the generative AI market.\n\nIt partnered with the quantum computing company Riverlane, which is using AMD’s Zinq UltraScale+ RFSoC as a platform to act as an interface between Riverlane’s control software and the high-speed pulse lasers that are fired to control qubits.\n\nAMD’s revenue in the fourth quarter was $6.16 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Net income jumped more than 3,000% to $667 million, and earnings per share rose from 1 cent a year ago to 41 cents per share in the most recent quarter.\n\nAMD stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nQuickLogic (QUIK) AI.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has sent shares of companies involved in the proliferation of this technology soaring over 16 months or so, with many names seeing a parabolic rise in their stock prices.\n\nA parabolic move is a rapid rise in the share price of a company in a short amount of time, akin to the right side of a parabolic curve on a chart. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a classic example of this phenomenon. The graphics specialist has seen a parabolic rise in its stock price since the beginning of 2023, with its shares jumping a whopping 439% since then. Nvidia, however, is one of the many companies gaining from AI adoption.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) are two more names that are capitalizing on AI. Let's look at the reasons why these two AI stocks could make a parabolic move.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia's Q4 fiscal 2024 results, which were released on Feb. 21, boosted investor confidence thanks to the company's outstanding AI-fueled growth and outlook. The stock deservedly jumped big time following its report, but management's commentary on the latest earnings call made it clear that there is room for more than one player in the lucrative AI chip market.\n\nNvidia predicts that the supply of its next-generation AI graphics cards will not be enough to support demand. It is worth noting that the company's current-generation flagship H100 AI chip is already commanding a waiting period of nine months to a year. So, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's customers looking for alternatives as no one would want to be left behind in the AI arms race.\n\nThis is where AMD can step in. The company was originally anticipating $2 billion in revenue from sales of AI chips in 2024 but has substantially raised its estimate to $3.5 billion now. It's likely that AMD will generate stronger AI revenue in 2024. That's because AMD's foundry partner is substantially increasing its capacity to manufacture advanced AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket research firm TrendForce reports that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, will increase its advanced chip-packaging capacity to a range of 33,000 to 35,000 wafers a month by the fourth quarter of 2024. That would be more than double TSMC's monthly capacity of 14,000 wafers to 15,000 wafers at the end of last year.\n\nGiven that AMD is one of TSMC's top customers, it won't be surprising to see the former benefiting from its foundry partner's increased packaging capacity. As it turns out, AMD management remarked on the previous earnings conference call that it has \"made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand.\"\n\nSo, the chances of AMD winning a bigger share of the AI chip market in 2024 cannot be ruled out. This could help the company outperform Wall Street's expectations in the coming quarters. Analysts currently expect AMD's earnings to increase 37% in 2024 to $3.64 per share, followed by a stronger jump of 50% next year to $5.46 per share. AMD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThe market can reward AMD stock handsomely for such terrific earnings growth, especially if AI helps it turn in better-than-expected results. That's why investors would do well to buy this semiconductor stock right away before it jumps further.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nShare prices of Palantir Technologies have shot up significantly of late following the release of the company's Q4 2023 results on Feb. 5. More specifically, Palantir stock has shot up a whopping 37% since then, indicating that it is already on a parabolic run.\n\nAI has played a central role in Palantir's latest surge. Palantir management pointed out on the company's recent earnings conference call that the demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is expanding its addressable market and \"propelling growth both through new customer acquisitions and expansions with existing customers.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the adoption of Palantir's AIP software has led to a solid acceleration in deal activity. The company saw a 2 times year-over-year jump in the number of deals worth $1 million or more in the previous quarter. Palantir's aggressive go-to-market strategy of conducting boot camps for customers to help them understand how to integrate AI into their operations led to robust growth in its commercial business.\n\nPalantir says that it conducted 560 boot camps to help roll out AIP last year. This explains why the company's Q4 commercial revenue increased an impressive 32% year over year to $284 million, outpacing the 20% growth in overall Q4 revenue to $608 million. Even better, the average trailing-12-month revenue per customer of its top 20 customers increased 11% year over year to $55 million. This suggests Palantir's customers are now willing to spend more on the company's offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, the total value of future contracts signed by Palantir, formally known as remaining performance obligations, increased nearly 28% from the year-ago period to $1.24 billion in the previous quarter. All these metrics suggest that Palantir's future revenue pipeline is improving thanks to AI.\n\nWhat's more, IDC estimates that the overall AI software market could grow from $64 billion in 2022 to $251 billion in 2027. Within the AI software market, AI platforms are predicted to grow at an annual rate of 36% through 2027. Palantir, therefore, is at the beginning of a massive growth curve, and the company is well-placed to take advantage of the AI software platform space thanks to its leading position in this niche, as per IDC.\n\nThe above catalysts tell us why analysts are predicting Palantir's earnings will increase at an annual rate of 85% for the next five years, which would be a big jump over the paltry annual growth of 2% seen in the last five years. So, there is a good chance that Palantir stock could continue soaring following its parabolic breakout, which is why investors should consider buying it without much delay.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "It should come as no surprise to my followers that NVIDIA (NVDA) did it again with another beat-and-raise quarter.\r\n\r\nDespite the rumblings of an \"AI bubble\" or questionable vendor financing tactics, the Starship Jensen delivered real and sustainable growth that pushed the stock to a $2 trillion market cap.\r\n\r\nRecall that was my forecast last spring...\r\n\r\nNvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion\r\n\r\nBut even I didn't think it was going to happen this soon.\r\n\r\nSo what's going on?\r\n\r\nYou can review that video and article to understand the 2023 business mechanics and industry dynamics of GPUs stacked in DGX systems, running \"massively parallel architectures\" on CUDA.\r\n\r\nI made that piece when NVDA shares were trading $400 to explain to investors why the stock launched in late May from $300 -- and would never look down again.\r\n\r\nThe pivotal moment came in late May at the Computex event in Taiwan when NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms were all lined up for his latest DGX-GPU system, the GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer that uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips into a single datacenter-sized GPU.\r\n\r\nSince I had just published my special report on ChatGPT the day before NVIDIA's March GPU Tech Conference (GTC), I put two and two together... to get 200!\r\n\r\nYou see, when I published that report on March 20, I had no idea that Jensen would start talking about ChatGPT as “the AI heard round the world” and that this was AI's \"iPhone Moment\" of transformational demand.\r\n\r\nAnd even though I didn't need any convincing to buy and hold NVDA shares (we had just scooped it near 18-month lows under $125 in October of 2022), something hit me when I heard that those 3 datacenter giants were the first big customers for GH200 systems...\r\n\r\nIf they were going to keep building and improving their own internal LLMs (large language models), then the other 997 corporations in the Fortune 1000 would be itching to do it too!\r\n\r\nMake that the other 1,997 enterprises in the Global 2000.\r\n\r\nFrom March to June, we saw NVIDIA sales projections for last year and this year essentially double. And I said in June that even those expectations were too tame.\r\n\r\nBecause the race was on for every enterprise to build and scale their own LLM for internal data mining, industry insights, and next-gen innovation.\r\n\r\nIf you want a copy of my ChatGPT report, Time to Become an AI Conversationalist, just email Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you.\r\n\r\nWhat's Different Now?\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, not much has changed. The demand is still off the charts and the GPUs keep getting better and faster.\r\n\r\nAnd so that means only the important things have changed: the speed, power, names, and price of the GPUs.\r\n\r\nYep, as they get better, they keep getting pricier. And that's why NVIDIA was able to boast 76% gross margins last week in their quarterly report.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, I made a video using a recent NVIDIA presentation to highlight the secular drivers of this incredible AI revolution.\r\n\r\nIn that video, I showed over half-a-dozen slides that really communicate the transformation that is occuring for every sector of the economy.\r\n\r\nAnd while some folks like to make fun of ChatGPT for what it can or can't do, this is about far more than generative AI questions and answers.\r\n\r\nWhat I left out of my 7-minute video was a discussion of all the much more important transformations happening in science, engineering, medicine, agriculture, climate studies, and industrial productivity and automation.\r\n\r\nThose are the most exciting areas where the \"massively parallel architectures\" of GPU-driven AI can make a difference and change the world.\r\n\r\nEstimates: Up, Up, and Away\r\n\r\nIn the video, I also show the Zacks Detailed Earnings Estimates tables for NVDA with the stunning upward revisions that we are witnessing since their report last week.\r\n\r\nFor this fiscal year 2025 (began in February), the topline moved from $93 billion to $98.6 billion. But I said they would keep going higher, and as of Wednesday we're now looking at a consensus of $102.4B for a potential 68% annual leap, with the high estimate at $107B.\r\n\r\nAnd next year is clocking in at over $117B with the high estimate at $136B. Again, I still expect these estimates to all move higher.\r\n\r\nIn the video, I explain why NVIDIA will likely hit $200 billion in revenues sometime by 2027.\r\n\r\nAnd that means NVIDIA will be the next $3 trillion company.\r\n\r\nDisclosure: I own shares of NVDA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia Surges to $800: Here Is 1 Potential Red Flag Before You Buy Shares",
        "content": "Undoubtedly, artificial intelligence (AI) chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the toast of Wall Street right now. The stock is up an eye-popping 234% over the past year. It's not without cause: Nvidia's earnings per share grew a blistering 765% year over year in the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal year 2024, which ended Jan. 28.\n\nNividia recently soared beyond $800 per share, valuing the company at almost $2 trillion. The company's stranglehold on the AI chip market has investors piling in for what is expected to be years of hypergrowth for artificial intelligence.\n\nBut there is one red flag investors should at least consider as they buy shares.\n\nThis isn't meant to imply that Nvidia won't be a featured player in AI moving forward, but it's something worth keeping in mind as Nvidia's price increasingly factors in growth that hasn't happened yet.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nNvidia's customer concentration is concerning\n\nCEO Jensen Huang emphasized on the company's recent earnings call that demand for its AI chips still far exceeds supply. However, those successfully obtaining the chips are a select group of technology's most prominent players.\n\nAccording to data by Bloomberg and Barclays, and reported by the Financial Times, Nvidia's estimated revenue breakdown signals that a small group of companies are contributing a ton of the company's total sales:\n\nCompany Estimated Percentage of Revenue Microsoft 15% MetaPlatforms 13% Amazon 6.2% Alphabet 5.8% DellTechnologies 5.8% SuperMicroComputer 5%\n\nData sources: Bloomberg, Barclays, and The Financial Times.\n\nThese six companies are roughly 51% of Nvidia's revenue. It makes sense -- few companies other than big tech giants have the deep pockets to spend enough to have that impact on Nvidia's business. AI has become an arms race, a sprint to build cutting-edge computing platforms for customers to develop and deploy their AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe risk of alternative chips\n\nInvestors shouldn't necessarily worry about the long-term demand for AI chips. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su believes the AI chip market will explode to $400 billion by 2027. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes trillions of dollars are needed to invest appropriately in supporting AI's long-term growth potential.\n\nNvidia was prepared for the AI boom and is dominating the chip market, with market share estimates ranging from 80% to 90%. Considering Nvidia's Q4 revenue was \"just\" $22 billion companywide, it's clear that more growth lies ahead if AI becomes the massive industry tech insiders believe it can be.\n\nBut investors are increasingly wagering, by bidding the stock increasingly higher, that technology's most prominent companies will continue relying on Nvidia's chips. It looks like that may not remain the case.\n\nThere have been numerous reports of companies within Nvidia's top six developing their own AI chips to break free from the leverage Nvidia currently has over them. Meta Platforms will reportedly implement a custom AI chip in its data centers this year. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are also developing in-house custom AI chips.\n\nBe careful looking too far ahead\n\nThat doesn't mean these custom chips will be superior to Nvidia's or completely replace Nvidia's, even if they perform well.\n\nHowever, analysts are racing to raise their long-term estimates, and price targets are following. But there's a real risk that Nvidia will begin to lose some business, and there aren't many customers like these to easily backfill losing a major customer.\n\nData center revenue has grown to 78% of the total business. Investors should be careful buying the stock because it's cheap based on estimates for 2026. That's an assumption that Nvidia will grow into its lofty expectations. The further out you look, the riskier the stock becomes.\n\nThat's not to say that Nvidia won't remain an essential company in AI, but it's a reminder of how far the stock has come and that future results aren't guaranteed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 25 companies with the best benefits and perks. If you would like to skip our discussion on the global workforce trends, you can go to the 5 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks.\n\nIn today's dynamic business environment, attracting top talent requires more than just competitive salaries; it demands a comprehensive benefits package that will address the diverse needs of a modern workforce. Companies that offer various perks not only enhance their attractiveness as employers but also leverage these benefits as strategic tools for business growth and sustainability.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that organizations recognized for their superior employee benefits often report lower turnover rates, translating to significant cost savings in recruitment and training. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 56% of US employees consider employer-sponsored health benefits when deciding to stay in their current job. When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms. This helps in understanding how innovative benefits can shape business outcomes and employee satisfaction. The companies that lead in this realm not only offer traditional perks but also prioritize the holistic well-being of both full-time and part-time employees.\n\nWorkplace Evolution: Changing Expectations of Today's Workers\n\nA Microsoft survey from 2021 found that 41% of workers globally were thinking about leaving their jobs within the next year, showing how people's expectations from their workplaces are changing. Health benefits are now crucial for employee satisfaction, as highlighted in another 2021 Glassdoor survey where 40% of the respondents said health insurance is the most important benefit. Furthermore, the desire for flexible work is also growing. In a 2022 FlexJobs survey, 56% of participants said they'd consider finding a new job if remote work options were taken away. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are adapting to these changing needs of employees by introducing flexible policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Google, a key player under Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), there's significant emphasis on creating a rich workplace culture and extending a wide range of benefits to its employees. This commitment has consistently positioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the top of employee satisfaction surveys, highlighting the importance of employee well-being in achieving organizational excellence. This has also helped improve Alphabet's financial performance, with the company achieving a remarkable 13.49% growth in revenue in the final quarter of 2023. Similarly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also prioritizes employee benefits and is one of the companies with the best health benefits. With perks like healthcare, parental leave, and development opportunities, Microsoft has created a workplace that promotes a positive culture and boosts innovation and productivity. This approach has been vital to Microsoft's ongoing financial success, consistently reaching a market capitalization of over a trillion dollars. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is another company that promotes a deep sense of unity and community among its staff. Salesforce's commitment to its employees is evident in its low attrition rates and high satisfaction scores. With consistent year-over-year growth, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) remains a leader in the customer relationship management sector.\n\nHere’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for customer relationship management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) software. The company offers many other products including software for marketing automation, customer service automation, analytics, application integration, and enterprise collaboration among others. During the quarter, Salesforce increased guidance for the fiscal year including higher revenue growth, higher free cash flow growth, and higher operating margins. The company also indicated it is seeing a less measured buying environment and more business opportunities, indicating the macro environment is getting relatively better for them. Salesforce is deeply entrenched within its customer base, has high retention, high recurring revenue, and is a very scalable business with high margin potential. Salesforce is dominant across its offerings and is constantly innovating with new products, features, and artificial intelligence to deepen customer relationships and grow the business.” 25 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks\n\nA headshot collage of employees indicating the company's diversity and innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 25 companies with the best benefits and perks in 2024, we consulted a number of credible sources, such as CareerAddict, Fingerprint For Success, and BetterUp.

Posted in our office is this chart that ASML provides at each of its investor days. This chart is a little outdated from 2021, but we think illustrates how value (in operating profit) was distributed across semiconductors, hardware, and then software & services. It’s very clear that most of the economic value in the past has accrued to the software services (in grey) built on the backs of highly technical companies run by extremely smart people.\n\nWhy is this? We think it is due to a combination of distribution and network effects. Our working hypothesis right now is that this will likely remain a similar outcome in the AI epoch.

        "title": "From ‘Britain’s Warren Buffet’ to market sage Rob Arnott, here’s why investor naysayers are skeptical ‘first-mover’ Nvidia will continue to lead the AI boom",
        "content": "Every time investors have braced themselves for the AI bubble to burst in the last few months, a new eye-popping data point comes out to prove them wrong and send money flowing back into the stock market.\n\nThe latest shock was Nvidia’s latest quarterly earnings, which managed to surpass investors’ already sky-high expectations and set records for valuation increases. Investors have since been falling over themselves to declare a golden era of AI application.\n\nAnd it’s not just Nvidia. Companies across the supply chain, including established brands like ASML and exciting upstarts like Arm, have enjoyed booming valuations since investors caught wind of the excitement around AI.\n\nBut there are dissenters within the ranks who are warning against a continued boom for AI and Nvidia’s place at its peak.\n\nIn each investor’s scope is one standout point, you should be wary of the early success of the first-mover.\n\n‘Disruptors are often disrupted’\n\nFortune’s Shawn Tully spoke with two investors who remain skeptical of Nvidia’s boom and the wider AI rally in general.\n\nThe first was Rob Arnott, the founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, which oversees investment strategies for $139 billion worth of mutual funds and ETFs.\n\n“It was usually not true that first, the new technology brought on change nearly as rapid as the markets predicted,” he told Fortune. “And second, it was often not true that these will be the dominant players 5 or 10 or even 20 years in the future.”\n\nIn addition to skepticism about the long-term power of the first-mover, Arnott thinks Nvidia’s current valuation is too high, leaving no room for negative shocks or disappointing results.\n\nAI boom is like a soccer stadium\n\nTerry Smith, the 70-year-old fund manager labeled “Britain’s Warren Buffett,” knows a thing or two about bubbles from his decades at the helm of the U.K.’s biggest retail investor-driven funds.\n\nSmith’s investment strategy is similar to Warren Buffett’s, picking stocks based on their underlying value in search of long-term rewards, leading to his nickname. It appears to be why he’s staying away from the current rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders published in January, Smith said investors believe they have been able to pick the winners and losers of the AI rush.\n\n“If it can do so at this stage it would seem to me to be a break with tradition,” Smith said.\n\nIn a similar sentiment to Arnott, Smith pointed to the first movers in every major technological milestone, like Yahoo’s early command over the search engine to Nokia’s dominance of mobile phones and Myspace’s initial popularity as a social media platform.\n\nSmith said there may not be any winners from the AI boom at all. To hammer this point home, he used a “football stadium” (soccer) analogy.\n\n“As the game becomes exciting and the striker runs into the penalty area with the ball, the second row of spectators stands up to get a better view,” Smith wrote.\n\n“This blocks the view of those in the third row who follow suit. Pretty soon all the spectators are standing but no one has a better view than before, but they are all less comfortable.”\n\nSpeaking on stockbroker AJ Bell’s Money and Markets podcast last week, Smith said he still didn’t own any shares in Nvidia, or any of the other “Magnificent Seven” group of stocks for that matter.\n\n‘It’s not the first movers who usually win, it’s the second movers’\n\nFortune’s Tully also spoke with accountant Jack Ciesielski, the former author of Analyst’s Accounting Observer.\n\nLike Smith, Ciesielski was able to point to other early leaders in previous great leaps forward in previous technology booms, and they’re tough for even nerds to remember.\n\n“Remember what happened in word processing and early PCs,” he says. “First, you had the likes of WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Lotus, along with Commodore, Radio Shack and Eagle. But they lost, and the prizes went to Apple and Microsoft.\n\n“It was the same in the early days of The Internet. The companies that laid the cable such as UUNET and Lucent got big valuations, and are no longer with us. But those that thrived turned out to be the Amazons, Googles and companies that used the pipes.”\n\nCiesielski surmises: “It’s not the first movers who usually win, it’s the second movers.”\n\nCanal systems\n\nCiesielski is far from alone in pointing out that second movers usually take the spoils, and it’s not just a phenomenon of the tech world. Indeed, it’s something that stretches back centuries to the industrial revolution.\n\nSpeaking to Fortune’s Will Daniel, Goldman Sachs’ chief global equity strategist and head of macro research in Europe, Peter Oppenheimer made a comparison with the London canal systems of the 18th century.\n\nAt the time, there was a flurry of investment into canal operators at the forefront of vastly improved transport links that displaced the horse and carriage.\n\nInstead, it was the companies utilizing the canals for their products that became long-term winners. The lesson for AI means the biggest winners of the tech boom could be people utilizing it to make new products and services.\n\n“The biggest winners are the people that can use the technologies to develop new products and services.”\n\nThe bulls of the AI world—and its current kingmakers—still hold the high ground. But wary investors will give them food for thought: is Nvidia the next Apple, or Radioshack?\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "SMH vs. XSD: Which Semiconductor ETF Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "The semiconductor sector has been outperforming many others in the market and shows few signs of slowing down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at two popular semiconductor ETFs to see which is the better choice for investors — the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) or the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD).\n\nWhile these are both great ETFs that invest in semiconductor stocks, they differ quite a bit in several key ways, which we’ll explore in this article.\n\nWhat Is the SMH ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to VanEck, SMH “seeks to replicate… the price and yield performance of the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index (MVSMHTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment.”\n\nVanEck explains, “Rather than attempting to pick individual stock winners in this ever-evolving sector, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF provides exposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.”\n\nWhat Is the XSD ETF’s Strategy?\n\nXSD seeks to give investors exposure to the semiconductor sector of the S&P Total Market Index (TMI) by investing in the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index.\n\nThe key difference between XSD and SMH is that this is a “modified equal weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large, mid and small cap stocks.” We’ll discuss this further when we compare the funds’ holdings.\n\nPortfolio Comparison\n\nSMH is index-weighted. It owns 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for over three-quarters of its assets.\n\nBelow is an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nOn the other hand, XSD uses a modified equal-weighted approach, so it is much less concentrated. It owns 40 stocks, and its top 10 positions make up just 33.5% of the fund. Below is an overview of XSD’s top 10 holdings.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou’ll immediately notice that these different strategies result in very different-looking portfolios, even though these are both semiconductor ETFs. Right away, you’ll see that Nvidia is the top holding for both funds, but it makes up over one-quarter of SMH’s assets while it accounts for a smaller, more manageable 4.2% of XSD’s assets.\n\nHowever, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing for SMH. The generative AI leader has skyrocketed to a 235% gain over the past year, so SMH has benefited from this significant exposure, as it has propelled the ETF to significant gains. On the other hand, you can also make the case that XSD’s smaller, more manageable position gives it less exposure to risk if Nvidia shares pull back.\n\nBeyond weightings, the funds also differ in another key way.\n\nAs discussed above, SMH’s investments in the semiconductor space span “the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.” This means that SMH invests in the companies that fabricate semiconductors, like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), as well as the companies that make the equipment used in the semiconductor fabrication process, like Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nNotably, while XSD is nominally more diversified than SMH in that it holds fewer stocks and is less concentrated, this segment of the semiconductor supply chain is conspicuously absent from its portfolio, meaning that it is not as diversified as SMH in this regard.\n\nTo me, this gives SMH a clear edge over XSD in terms of who has the better portfolio. This is a bit of a shame for XSD because these are great companies that are generating stellar returns for their shareholders. For example, Applied Materials is up 83.2% over the past year, while Lam Research is up 96.9%. Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML are up 51.9% and 51.1%, respectively.\n\nThese semiconductor equipment companies are also highly rated by TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Taiwan Semiconductor and ASML Holding receive ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores, while Lam Research receives a 9. Applied Materials receives a Neutral-equivalent Smart Score of 7.\n\nOverall, eight out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher, while seven of XSD’s top 10 holdings do. SMH receives an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8, while XSD receives a Neutral-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 7.\n\nBased on these Smart Scores and the absence of chipmakers and equipment makers from XSD’s portfolio, I’m giving SMH the distinctive edge in terms of portfolio composition.\n\nHead-to-Head Performance\n\nSMH has also outperformed XSD over the years when it comes to the investment returns that it has generated. As of January 31, SMH has soundly beaten XSD over the past three years, with a three-year annualized return of 18.8% versus XSD’s three-year return of just 5.8%. Over the past five years, SMH has also beaten XSD with an annualized return of 32.1% versus a 24.5% annualized return for XSD. To be clear, these are both very good returns, but SMH’s are markedly better.\n\nLastly, over the past 10 years, the gap narrows a bit, but SMH’s 26.1% annualized return still trumps XSD’s 22.0% return.\n\nSome of the gap in recent years comes down to the scintillating performance of SMH’s largest position, Nvidia. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and in the event of an Nvidia pullback, XSD could potentially outperform SMH in the future, but one would still have to give the edge to SMH in the performance category.\n\nIdentical Fees\n\nThese ETFs directly compete for customers and their investment dollars, so it is perhaps unsurprising that they feature identical expense ratios of 0.35%, making this category a tossup. This means that an investor in either fund will pay $35 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SMH earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.74 implies 8.0% upside potential from current levels.\n\nIs XSD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XSD earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 34 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XSD stock price target of $256.65 implies 17.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInterestingly, sell-side analysts see more potential upside from XSD. This is likely because, after the massive run Nvidia has had, analysts expect more potential upside from some of the sector’s laggards, which XSD is more allocated towards.\n\nAdding It All Up\n\nIn reality, these are both great ETFs that have generated significant returns for investors over a long period. I give the edge to SMH, as its portfolio looks stronger based on TipRanks’ Smart Score and because its portfolio includes semiconductor fabrication and equipment stocks, which are unfortunately lacking from XSD’s portfolio. Furthermore, SMH has been a stronger performer over the past three, five, and 10 years.\n\nIn my view, SMH is the hands-down winner based on these factors, but you can make the case for owning either ETF. For more conservative investors who don’t feel comfortable having over 25% exposure to Nvidia and who are looking for a less concentrated way to approach the semiconductor space, XSD would likely be the way to go. Furthermore, if Nvidia slows down and some of the space’s less-heralded stocks begin to catch up to it, XSD could outperform SMH.\n\nDisclosure",

(29:25) - Breaking Down Magnificent 7 Stocks Using The Earnings (35:30) - Episode Roundup: NVDA, SMCI, AAPL, VRT, MSFT Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #392 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how the Zacks Rank stock ranking system got it right on NVIDIA and the other hot AI and datacenter stocks over the last year. The Rank was signaling something was going on in the datacenter and chip industries as the Rank moved to the highest level, the Strong Buy, last year and has mostly stayed at that level.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer and Vertiv, all three involved in AI and datacenters, remain Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks after their recent earnings reports.\n\nWere you noticing the Rank on these stocks? It was signaling something “good” was going on at these companies.\n\nWhat is the Zacks Rank?\n\nThe Zacks Rank is Zacks stock ranking system which ranks stocks into 5 categories with Strong Buys being the top category, and Strong Sells the bottom category. However, most stocks will be ranked in the middle, as Holds.\n\nZacks ranks over 4400 stocks. The top ranked stocks are rare. There are currently just 244 Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) stocks.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is based on analyst earnings estimate revisions and can change daily. It is just a 1 to 3-month recommendation.\n\nHow to Get a Strong Buy Rank\n\nIn order to get the #1 Strong Buy rank, the analysts have to be in agreement and raising earnings estimates.\n\nWhen a company reports earnings, beats, and then raises guidance, that’s the perfect conditions for the company to achieve the top rank. After a beat and raise, the analysts usually end up revising their own estimates higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany AI and datacenter companies have been beating, and raising, for several quarters. The Zacks Rank has been signaling for months that something “good” was going on.\n\nHow the Zacks Rank Got it Right on NVIDIA and other Datacenter Stocks\n\n1. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA first became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the second quarter of 2023, after it reported earnings and beat and raised.\n\nNVIDIA actually fell to a #2 (Buy) late in 2023 but it jumped back up to a #1 (Strong Buy) again in 2024 after the recent earnings beat and raise. Shares of NVIDIA are up 73% since May 30, 2023, which is a few days after earnings to the present.\n\nNVIDIA analysts are still raising estimates. Fourteen earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2025 in the last week and none have been cut.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about NVIDIA?\n\n2. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer was a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as early as the fourth quarter of 2021. It also fell to a #2 (Buy) during that period before busting out to #1 (Strong Buy) rank again in the third quarter of 2023, after earnings.\n\nZacks only has 3 analyst estimates on Super Micro Computer for the full year, as it’s not as highly followed on the Street as NVIDIA.\n\nBut those analysts are still bullish. 2 estimates have been revised higher on Super Micro Computer in the last month for both Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Super Micro Computer?\n\n3. Vertiv Holdings Co. (VRT)\n\nVertiv, like NVIDIA, has been beating and raising every quarter for the last year. Vertiv became a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the same time as NVIDIA, in the second quarter of 2023. It has briefly fallen to a #2 (Buy) stock but has now reclaimed the Strong Buy rank.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Vertiv as well. 2 earnings estimates have been revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025. Even though it’s a large cap company, Zacks has just 3 estimates on the company for both years. It is not heavily covered on the Street.\n\nShould investors still trust the signal the Zacks Rank is sending about Vertiv?\n\nWhat’s Does the Zacks Rank Signal About Mega Cap AI?\n\n4. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)\n\nAlphabet has not been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the fourth quarter of 2021. It was briefly a #2 (Buy) in the third quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAlphabet is currently a Zacks #3 (Hold), which is where most stocks end up. The analysts are mixed on Alphabet for 2024. 10 estimates were raised for the full year in the last 30 days, but 7 were also cut during that time.\n\nIs the stock reflecting the uncertainty in Alphabet’s earnings outlook?\n\n5. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft hasn’t been a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) since the first quarter of 2020. It has, however, recently been a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. It was a Buy stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. It remains a #2 (Buy) stock.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Microsoft for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. 17 earnings estimates are higher for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 in the last 30 days, with no analyst estimate cuts.\n\nWith all that bullishness, why isn’t Microsoft a #1 (Strong Buy) instead of a #2?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Using the Zacks Rank?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of VRT, MSFT and GOOGL in her own personal portfolio.

        "title": "Stock Splits Watch: 3 Likely Candidates to Keep on Your Radar in 2024",
        "content": "While stock splits don’t necessarily change the valuation of a company’s stock. They do offer some benefits. Namely, they can make a stock more affordable for retail investors. In that way, companies can draw in new shareholders and capital when they split their stock. For existing shareholders, stock splits increase their share count without them having to spend more money. Over time, this can also prove beneficial as it grows the overall investment of an individual stockholder. Institutional investors may not care all that much about stock splits. However, they are closely followed by retail investors who would love to get their hands on the stocks of certain companies. But, they remain out of reach because a single share costs upwards of $1,000 or more.\n\nSome companies have never split their stock despite the price running higher and higher. Yet investors continue to cling to hope that a split will eventually be announced. Here is stock split watch: three likely candidates to keep on your radar in 2024.\n\nLike Candidates for Stock Splits: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to soar and has already risen 64% this year to trade at close to $800. The company’s market capitalization is a hair below $2 trillion. The rapid rise in the share price and its lofty height has ignited speculation that the stock might split. The last time Nvidia split its stock (on a four-for-one basis) in July 2021, the share price had just surpassed $550. Management at the company might be concerned that the rapidly rising stock is putting it out of the reach of retail investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe complicating factor in all of this is that NVDA stock does not look overvalued at current levels. This is perceived given the company’s explosive growth rate. Currently, Nvidia’s shares are the cheapest among the Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks. That’s what happens when a company’s sales rise 265% year-over-year and its profits grow at an annualized rate of 769%. Still, for individual investors, paying nearly $800 for one share of Nvidia no doubt comes with sticker shock. Still, many analysts see the share price crossing $1,000 after the company’s recent blowout earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nAnother stock and that is starting to look expensive is pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Up 30% on the year and up 143% over the last 12 months, LLY stock is currently trading at an all-time high of $770 per share. The company’s market capitalization stands at $730 billion and many analysts expect Eli Lilly to become the world’s first $1 trillion dollar pharmaceutical concern. The stock continues to rise as sales of its new weight loss drug called “Zepbound” accelerate, prompting speculation that a stock split is coming.\n\nEli Lilly has undergone four previous stock splits, but the last one happened way back in October 1997. Each previous stock split occurred on a two-for-one basis. Given that the stock is at an all-time high and the speed at which the share price continues to rise, a stock split this year would certainly make sense. LLY stock can be expected to continue climbing higher if the company’s earnings keep growing along with global sales of Zepbound. The weight loss drug was only approved by United States regulators last fall, and analysts expect that sales will surpass $1 billion in its first year on the market.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a company that has never split its stock. That would be Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). With its share price near $2,650, CMG stock is out of reach for many retail investors. Given the lofty price, Chipotle is constantly discussed as a stock split candidate. Chipotle has been a consistent winner for shareholders since going public in 2006, having risen 77% in the last 12 months alone, including an 18% gain so far in 2024. But for many investors, the share price remains prohibitive. CMG stock also doesn’t pay a dividend, adding to the frustration of shareholders.\n\nSo is 2024 the year that CMG stock finally splits? Possibly. The company continues to grow its chain of Mexican restaurants and its earnings at a brisk pace. The quick service restaurant company recently reported earnings per share (EPS) of $10.36 compared to $9.75 that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at $2.52 billion versus $2.49 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 15% from a year earlier, while same-store sales increased 8.4%. The company plans to open as many as 315 new restaurant locations in 2024.\n\nSplitting its stock would only add fuel to the fire for CMG stock and serve to draw in retail investors who would love to get their hands on shares of this best-in-class restaurant name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and LLY.

        "content": "HP Inc. CEO Enrique Lores says the stage is set for a recovery in PC demand later this year, even if the outlook for the first half of 2024 looks mixed at best.\n\n\"Demand has slowed down in commercial,\" Lores told Yahoo Finance Live on Wednesday, but he expects growth to return for the PC market in the second half of the year.\n\nLores' near-term caution in part reflects continued demand challenges in the computer and printer markets.\n\nLaptop shipments fell 16% month over month in January, according to data from Citi analyst Christopher Danely. The trend was worse than the 14% quarter on quarter drop notched in the final three months of 2023.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter, HP saw sales decline in both personal systems and printers divisions, the company announced today. Its total revenue of $13.2 billion missed analyst estimates of $13.58 billion, while its full year guidance of $3.25 earnings per share also came in below expectations.\n\n\"We believe the PC recovery could moderate in 2024 given lackluster demand,\" Danely said.\n\nThe AI PC is coming, Lores told Yahoo Finance earlier this year, which could lift his company's top line. Until then, HP is maintaining a tight grip around costs to protect its margins.\n\nAs evidence of that, the company was able to expand quarterly profit margins year over year at both its divisions.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet Sales: $13.2 billion (-4.4% year over year) vs. $13.58 billion estimated Personal Systems Sales: $8.8 billion (-4.4% year over year) vs. $9.2 billion estimated Printing Sales: $4.4 billion (-5% year over year) vs. $4.39 billion estimated Diluted EPS: $0.81 (+11% year over year) vs. $0.81 estimated (guidance: $0.76-$0.86)\n\nWhat else caught our attention\n\nFiscal Second Quarter EPS Guidance: $0.76 to $0.86 vs. $0.82 estimated Full Year EPS Guidance: $3.25 vs. $3.65 estimated (previous guidance: $3.25-$3.65)\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Unlike the Internet Bubble, AI Is \"Not Hype,\" Says JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. 1 Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist if He's Right.",
        "content": "In a far-reaching interview on Monday with CNBC’s Leslie Picker, outspoken JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon addressed the debate over the growing interest in all things artificial intelligence (AI) and whether or not the technology is more hype than substance.\n\nSome market commentators are starting to suggest there's a bubble in AI stocks, and it's bigger than the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Dimon categorically refutes that assertion, saying there's no comparison. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDimon told Picker on CNBC:\n\nWhen we had the internet bubble the first time around ... that was hype. This is not hype. It's real. People are deploying [AI] at different speeds, but it will handle a tremendous amount of stuff.\n\nHe went even further, arguing that generative AI will eventually \"be used in almost every job\" and could even cure cancer, \"because it can do things the human mind simply cannot do.\"\n\nThe one AI stock to buy\n\nIf Dimon's views hold true, then there is potential gains to be had by investing in AI-related ventures. If I could buy just one stock to capture the accelerating adoption of AI, it would have to be Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). After pioneering the graphics processing units (GPUs) that render lifelike images in video games, the company adapted the technology to withstand the rigors of AI. Parallel processing, which breaks down larger computational jobs into smaller, more manageable chunks, works equally well for AI as it did in gaming.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has expanded beyond the processor itself, providing turnkey AI systems that include the chips and the software that makes them more efficient. Cloud and data center operators are scrambling to revamp their systems to handle the massive influx of AI, an upgrade cycle that could be worth more than $1 trillion. Furthermore, with an estimated 95% share of the GPU data center market, Nvidia will likely reap the lion's share of the rewards.\n\nIf you have any doubts, consider this: In its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's revenue grew 265% year over year to $22.1 billion, while adjusted earnings per share surged 486% to $5.16.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's why Nvidia is the one stock to buy hand over fist to profit from the AI boom that Jamie Dimon is confirming.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wednesday, February 28, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Visa Inc. (V) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+239.1% vs. +164.8%). The company’s Computer & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.\r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+29.8% vs. +25.2%). The company’s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. It expects net revenues to increase in the low double digits for fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nVisa, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing bottom-line growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\r\n\r\nThe company beat earnings estimates by 3.4% in the fiscal first quarter of 2024. However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia-Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+24.3% vs. -4.5%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.\r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon Therapeutics has given Amgen a significant rare disease business. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone up ahead of Q4 earnings release. Amgen has positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Chubb Ltd. (CB), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) and PACCAR Inc (PCAR).\r\n\r\nMark Vickery\r\nSenior Editor\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Yet, exposure to cat loss ails.\n\nIntelligent Devices Unit Aids Emerson (EMR), High Costs Hurt\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Emerson will benefit from strength in Intelligent Devices segment, driven by strong demand in the hybrid and process end markets. However, high costs remain concerning.\n\nSolid Expansion Efforts Aid Domino's (DPZ), High Costs Ail\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Domino's is benefiting from solid expansion efforts, digitalization and sales-building initiatives. However, inflationary pressures in commodity and labor costs are a concern.\n\nTransUnion's (TRU) Recent Acquisition Aids Amid Competition\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, the acquisition of Verisk Financial is helping TransUnion to offer enhanced solutions and improve fraud prevention. A high degree of competition restricts pricing power.\n\nOrganic Growth to Support KeyCorp (KEY) Amid Cost Concerns\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, decent loan growth, higher interest rates and KeyCorp's efforts to strengthen fee income will likely aid the top line. Elevated costs on technology upgrades will hurt profits.\n\nSolid Demand Momentum Driving Itron's (ITRI) Performance\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, easing supply chain troubles and operational execution is driving Itron's performance. Higher demand for electric vehicles and distributed energy resource management bode well.\n\nCarter's (CRI) Pricing & Other Efforts Appear Encouraging\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Carter's is making pricing efforts to address market conditions and enhance profitability. In fourth-quarter 2023, the company saw improved price realization and profit margins.\n\nNew Upgrades\n\nAftermarket Parts Growth & Low Leverage to Aid PACCAR (PCAR)\r\nThe Zacks analyst is optimistic about PACCAR's continued growth in the aftermarket parts, which is a high margin and less cyclic business.

This will get translated to increased distributable cash flows.\n\nNew Downgrades\n\nLower IT Spending to Hurt DXC Technology's (DXC) Prospects\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, DXC Technology's growth prospects might be hurt by soft IT spending as organizations are pushing back their large IT investment plans amid the macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nVishay (VSH) Suffers From Sluggish MOSFET and Opto Segments\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Vishay is suffering from weakness in MOSFET and optoelectronics product lines, particularly in the Americas and Asia regions.\n\nCompetition From Clean Fuel Sources Ail Arch Resources (ARCH)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Arch Resources' results are adversely impacted as emissions concerns push coal back in comparison with other clean fuel sources.

        "title": "3 Overlooked Emerging Markets Opportunities: Turkey, Thailand &amp; Taiwan",
        "content": "A Barron’s article appeared at the end of 2023 discussing why Turkey could be one of the biggest emerging markets opportunities in 2024. So far, the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF (NASDAQ:TUR) is up 14.3% year-to-date (YTD), more than double the S&P 500.\n\n“A broader argument for Turkish stocks rests on valuation and positioning. Turkey is dirt cheap relative to other emerging markets, at an average price-to-forward-earnings ratio of 3.9, and somewhat cheap relative to its own history,” Barron’s contributor Craig Mellow reported on East Capital senior consultant Emre Akcakmak’s comments about Turkish stocks. “This is the fifth time over the past 15 years that we have been close to these levels, and every time we have seen a bump.” The question is whether they can keep going.\n\nTurkey is one of three emerging markets whose name begins with T. The other two are Thailand and Taiwan. To spread the risk around, here are three stocks to buy, one from each country.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBİM Birleşik Mağazalar (BMBRF) Turkish flag with city in background\n\nSource: Halil ibrahim SARI / Shutterstock.com\n\nBİM Birleşik Mağazalar (OTCMKTS:BMBRF) is one of the largest publicly traded etail stocks  in Turkey. It started in 1995 with 21 stores. As of Sept. 30, 2023, it had 12,046 stores in Turkey, Morocco and Egypt. It is the pioneer of discount stores in Turkey.\n\nIn Q3 2023, it generated 61% of its sales from private label products, with the remainder coming from branded products and exclusive one-time offers. Its revenue in the third quarter was 74.41 billion Turkish lira (USD $2.39 billion), with an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of 6.67 billion Turkish lira (USD $214 million).\n\nIn addition to its discount stores, it started File in 2015. File stores provide a shopping environment that combines a supermarket and a department store, similar to Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Today, the subsidiary has 223 stores in 26 cities, and BMBRF opened four more File stores in the third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBIM is the largest holding in TUR with a weight of 7.07%, so for investors looking for emerging markets opportunities, both BIM and TUR seem to be good choices right now.\n\nAirports of Thailand (AIPUY) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nAirports of Thailand (OTCMKTS:AIPUY) is the fourth-largest holding of the iShares MSCI Thailand ETF (NYSEARCA:THD) with a weight of 5.09%. The Bangkok-based company went public in September 2002. It was spun off from the Airport Authority of Thailand, a state enterprise. The Thai government’s Ministry of Finance owns 70% of the public company.\n\nAs its name suggests, the company operates 39 airports in Thailand, including two in Bangkok, Thailand’s capital. In Q1 2024, its airports had 28.9 million passengers, 25.5% more than in Q1 2023. Approximately 58% of the passenger traffic was international, with the remaining 42% domestic.\n\nDeparture Passenger Service Charges (PSC) and Concession Revenues (CCR) accounted for 70% of its Q1 2024 revenue of 48.1 billion Thai baht (USD $1.34 billion). Its EBITDA profit in the third quarter was 9.37 billion Thai baht (USD $260 million). That was 186% higher than in Q3 2023.\n\nRegarding capacity, Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok has the highest, with 51.7 million passengers in 2023. Several projects are underway at the airport that will grow its capacity by 2028. With Thailand becoming an increasingly more visited location by foreign nationals, investing in its airports is another one of the emerging markets opportunities to take advantage of.\n\nASE Technology (ASX) Flag of the Republic of China or Taiwan on a processor, CPU Central processing Unit or GPU microchip on a motherboard. Taiwan manufacturing chip industry emerges as battlefront in US - China showdown. TSM stock\n\nSource: William Potter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe most obvious choice for Taiwanese stocks in the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (NYSEARCA:EWT) is the fund’s top holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). The company manufacturers Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nHowever, ASE Technology Holding (NYSE:ASX), the ninth-largest position in EWT with a 1.53% weight, presents a more interesting opportunity. ASE stands for Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, which is one of three operating units under the holding company’s umbrella.\n\n“ASEH develops and offers complete turnkey solutions covering front-end engineering test, wafer probing, IC packaging and modules, materials, final test, system and board level integration and, electronic design and manufacturing services (EMS),” states its company website.\n\nOf the 20 analysts covering its stock, 10 rate it a Buy, with the highest target price at $12.11 which is 27% higher than where it’s currently trading. The current analyst estimate for the company’s earnings in 2024 is 61 cents a share and 84 cents in 2025. It trades at less than 16x 2024 earnings-per-share (EPS) and 12x its 2025 earnings. ASX shares are up nearly 28% over the past year and 121% over the past five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 50%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 79.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -9.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.1%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 17.8% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Recently, more and more companies are offering AI-powered solutions and products every day to ride the wave of AI stocks. Yet for investors, this can be confusing, as just because a company claims to incorporate AI, doesn’t necessarily mean profitability. Now, more than ever, understanding the value an AI brings to a technological product or service is critical for investing.\n\nThe projects investors should look out for tend to have two different identifiers for determining product value. The first is any application where AI provides a generative product, such as a chat answer or a visual image. This is the application most commonly thought of when discussing AI, but it’s far from the most lucrative. AI computing applications, like data interpretation and network processing, are the second and most impactful to the tech industry.\n\nFor investors looking to understand these applications, these three AI stocks provided insight into the long-term potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart.

This is because the tech giant applies its expertise in graphics processing units to accelerate AI development. As such, there are three major projects currently driving Nvidia’s meteoric rise that investors should watch.\n\nFirst, the Nvidia DGX Systems are custom supercomputers that specialize in data processing for AI learning and research. Second, the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute offers expert-level education to developers looking to apply AI to their projects. Third, and potentially most important, Nvidia’s new A100 Tensor Core GPU has a memory bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second.\n\nTherefore, the GPU can process data at never-before-possible speeds, exponentially accelerating the learning speed of current large language models. As Nvidia continues cementing its market dominance, innovation-driven investors cannot afford to pass up the best AI stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its 2023 revenue reaching over 2.24 billion dollars, CrowdStrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) rise to success has been astonishing. In an increasingly connected and computerized world, CrowdStrike’s focus on cybersecurity has led to a highly profitable business model. Continuing this success now hinges on using AI computing to protect networks as the industry booms.\n\nTo achieve this, CrowdStrike currently leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to scan networks in real-time and detect threats. Further increasing security, CrowdStrike also uses AI to recognize dangerous behavioral patterns that could lead to new cyber attack methods. Ultimately, CrowdStrike’s AI applications rely on high-speed data processing to decide how to keep a customer’s network safe.\n\nThanks to this innovative AI-driven cybersecurity approach, CrowdStrike maintains a strong buy rating. Moreover, as the future of computing moves towards the cloud, CrowdStrike profits could soar alongside AI stocks.\n\nArista (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a 31% annual stock growth rate, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) now plans to use AI as rocket fuel to keep climbing. Arista specializes in telemetry and analytics using network switches to keep a finger on the pulse of internet traffic flows. The company also currently offers services in security and protection, as well as intent-based networking.\n\nTo maximize profits using AI, Arista will likely use machine learning to take high-level business objectives and apply them to network policy. By doing so, Arista assures that policy compliance flows down thoroughly throughout network requirements.\n\nFurthermore, Arista networks could continue to benefit from the expanding popularity of generative AI. That’s because it increases demand for network switches for training large language models, which directly influences Arista’s offerings. Savvy investors would be wise to jump on Arista’s transition into becoming one of the AI stocks of the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of “America’s Top Trader” Issues A.I.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- It has proved impossible to call the peak in this euphoric US stock market, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s tactical specialist Scott Rubner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Flawed Valuations Threaten $1.7 Trillion Private Credit Boom Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers Trump Eyes $4 Billion Stock Windfall as His Legal Bills Pile Up\n\nRetail traders have been lured into this rally just as a Goldilocks scenario — where the economy is running neither too hot nor too cold — has been playing out, prompting analysts quickly to upgrade their year-end targets, Rubner wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. March is now a “fuller house” and the rally is “tired,” however there is no catalyst for a potential selloff, he said.\n\nBeyond the little blip this week, US stocks have been on a tear since late last year. The record-setting run has been powered by Big Tech stocks led by AI poster child Nvidia Corp., which Rubner reckoned “the most important stock on planet earth” ahead of its blockbuster earnings report. Yet, there’s hardly any sign of a serious pullback.\n\n“‘The Return of the YOLO’ was not on my February bingo card,” Rubner said, referring to his previous call for a poor second half of February for US equities based on seasonal patterns. YOLO is the abbreviation for “you only live once” used in certain Reddit forums when retail traders make risky bets in stock markets.\n\n“I need to wake up every morning to see what stock can rally 50% by Friday.”\n\nThe rush is such that Goldman’s traders earlier this week pointed to data that underscored the market’s confidence in tech stocks. The put-call skew, often used as a measure of investor fear, has moved lower, and retail trading activity in Nvidia was in the 99.96th percentile for the week.\n\nBank of America Corp. strategist Michael Hartnett has also flagged that stocks tend to test several tops before a meaningful pullback. Conversely, the rebound from a bottom tends to be relatively quick “because human nature means ‘fear’ is so much more easier to reverse than ‘greed,’” Hartnett wrote in a note this month.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Why SoundHound AI Stock Is Plummeting Today",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) stock lost ground Wednesday morning -- trading 8% lower as of 10:30 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The audio-technologies specialist's shares had been down by as much as 14% earlier in the session.\n\nBefore the market opened Wednesday, a Northland analyst published a note that took a more cautious position on the stock. Northland's Michael Latimore lowered the firm's rating on the stock from outperform to market perform, and investors are pumping the brakes on an incredible run. Even on the heels of Wednesday's pullback, the SoundHound's stock remains up by roughly 240% over the last month.\n\nSoundHound AI stock's incredible run raises questions\n\nWhile Northland's analyst highlighted SoundHound's strengths and opportunities this year, the stock's steep valuation surge caused the firm to take a more cautious stance toward its share price. The audio tech stock has surged in conjunction with emerging artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities, the recent disclosure that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) owns a stake in the company, and other positive catalysts. In his note, Latimore said that investors should keep an eye on the rollout and adoption of the company's technologies at restaurants and drive-thrus this year.\n\nWhat comes next for SoundHound AI?\n\nFor better or worse, SoundHound's position as an AI play sets the stage for the stock to see continued volatility, particularly after its recent gains. As the Northland note asserts, investors should keep the company's valuation in mind and weigh their personal risk tolerance before going all in on the stock.\n\nNotably, SoundHound AI stock leaped higher earlier this month after Nvidia disclosed in its first-ever 13F filing that it owned roughly $3.7 million worth of the audio-tech company's stock. For a company of Nvidia's size and resources, however, that's a relatively small position -- and the graphics processing unit (GPU) leader actually made the investment back in 2017.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, this recent valuation surge for SoundHound AI stock doesn't necessarily mean that it won't continue to make big gains over the long term. In particular, rollout expansions for the company's personal-assistant platform (which integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT software) point to promising opportunities in voice-based interfaces for artificial intelligence systems.\n\nInvestors won't have to wait long to get the latest news on the company's business performance and outlook. SoundHound AI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results and host a conference call after the market closes Thursday.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks for Your March Must-Buy List (Hint: None Are Nvidia)",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still the hottest trend in 2024. After capturing investor imagination last year and sending almost every AI-adjacent stock skyward, the market may be ready to take a closer look at individual company potential.\n\nFor example, shares of C3.ai (NYSE:AI) are down 40% from their 52-week high as the AI software platform pushes profitability further into the future. Yet there are AI stocks not named Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that are still worth buying. The three stocks below should be on your must-buy list for March before their valuations explode.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) billboard showing two of its popular product lines, Ryzen and Radeon.\n\nSource: Joseph GTK / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s only natural that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will top the list. The chipmaker represents the biggest threat to Nvidia’s dominance in the space. I’ve argued previously that I don’t believe Advanced Micro will overtake its rival but that the stock is still worth buying. The AI space is still so new and growing rapidly that there will be plenty of profits to go around and AMD stock will be one of the primary beneficiaries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe recently introduced line of MI300 processors was explicitly designed for the complex tasks AI demands of chips. Even though they are brand new to the market, Advanced Micro told analysts it already had orders for $3.5 billion worth of the chips. Most of that is weighted towards the back end of the year, but it is one of the chipmaker’s fastest product ramps.\n\nBut demand could grow as the year progresses. Whereas Nvidia is in a constant state of chip shortages and is rapidly building out capacity to match it, Advanced Micro says it has sufficient capacity to meet even greater demand should it arise. AMD stock has been slightly negative since last month’s earnings report but that gives you time to buy before it begins the next leg of its journey higher.\n\nTwilio (TWLO) The brand logo of the US company \"Twilio\" on the display of a smartphone (focus on the brand logo), TWLO stock\n\nSource: David Esser / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nI’ll admit Twilio (NASDAQ:TWLO) is a bit of a contrarian play. Some might even argue it’s more in the category of overhyped AI stocks like C3.ai than an AMD clone. Down 23% year to date, the stock is battered. Yet a good case can be made for buying the heavily discounted now before it recovers and attains new heights.\n\nTwilio provides cloud-based communication services. It infused AI capabilities throughout its communication and customer services and applications. Verify uses it for omnichannel authentication. Unify for personalized customer engagement and Voice Intelligence for more realistic customer conversations. As businesses adopt AI-driven customer interactions, Twilio’s stock could benefit.\n\nTWLO stock collapsed due to a disappointing quarterly report, but management sees that changing this year. Much of the headwinds it faced were due to declining cryptocurrency volumes, a market that uses its authentication solutions. Twilio saw full-year double-digit growth without crypto, but crypto will still be a drag early this year. However, Twilio will lap the worst of it as the year progresses. With additional tailwinds like increased volumes elsewhere pushing it forward, TWLO stock has a clear path to future growth.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother cloud-based software solutions provider, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) integrates AI into its customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. AI is now a mission-critical part of its business.\n\nSalesforce’s AI platform, Einstein GPT Copilot, offers predictive analytics and personalized recommendations. Customers are flocking to the product and the company now counts 17% of all Fortune 100 companies as clients. Einstein performs 1 trillion transactions a week for them. They are also spending more money with Salesforce than previously did.\n\nWhen customers upgrade to CRM stock’s Unlimited Edition+ (UE+) package, Salesforce found customers increased their spending by more than 70%. UE+ bundles Einstein AI with data cloud solutions, which allows clients to accelerate their growth using AI, data and CRM. In more than two-thirds of its industries, Salesforce is seeing annual recurring revenue spike 50%.\n\nSalesforce has become one of the top AI stocks to buy, and it should only perform even better from here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "13 Stocks That Will Double in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 stocks that will double in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the stock market, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Double in 2024.\n\nLast year turned out to be wondrous for the US stock market as the S&P 500 gained over 25% compared to its 18% decline in the previous year. However, almost all of the gains were attributed to the Magnificent 7, which got a huge boost in investor sentiment due to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of the stocks that doubled in 2023, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was able to gain nearly 240%. Because of last year's performance, analysts expect good things to happen in 2024 too.\n\nFor the Magnificent 7, analysts have mixed opinions, as some of them believe that the 2023 rally has made these stocks overvalued. The rest of them believe that the AI revolution is real and there is no stop in sight in the near future. Apart from the seven big tech stocks, Wall Street analysts also have faith in some other stocks such as NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) and believe that AI is a huge growth catalyst for them.\n\nThe former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC’s Mad Money, Jim Cramer, holds the Magnificent 7 in high regard. However, he believes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be the weak link among the group and suggests Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to be its replacement. Cramer also has mixed views about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the short-term but still sees it in a favorable light for the long term due to iPhone sales and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nFor 2024, the technology sector still seems to be holding a celebrity status among analysts and financial media. Nevertheless, some other sectors that can get a huge boost due to the AI revolution include the healthcare and industrial sectors. The industrial sector can benefit from AI as it can help the industry in cost cutting, more effective performance tracking, and enhanced productivity due to AI automation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, while the healthcare sector benefits significantly from AI, it is also a defensive sector that can weather any unforeseen events like we experienced over the last three years. Additionally, AI is quite an old tool in the healthcare industry. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) has integrated AI and machine learning into the evolution of its surgical robotics for several years. Similarly, another healthcare company, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has been using AI for a while now and also has plans to boost further integration of the technology in its operations. Its chairman and CEO, Geoff Martha, said the following at the company’s latest earnings call:\n\n“...we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech. We also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company. We're incorporating a performance driven culture that's based on execution, speed and playing to win.”\n\nLooking toward the future, it seems like the Fed will be able to steer the US economy into a soft landing rather than a recession, which is a good sign for US stocks. Keeping that in mind, some of the stocks that will double in 2024 include Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W), Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nA graph plotting the trends and performance of stocks on the public equity markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 27 stocks that have the potential to double in 2024, according to several financial media sources including The Motley Fool, Investor Place, The Globe and Mail, and Kiplinger along with several others. The content of all our sources was published before January 1, 2024. Next, we chose those companies that experienced a rise in hedge fund sentiment in the fourth quarter of 2023. We then chose the 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nStocks that will double in 2024\n\n13. Aris Water Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:ARIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 15\n\nAris Water Solutions, Inc.

The average price target of $14.00 represented an upside of 44.93% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Aris Water Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:ARIS) as 15 funds had a total stake value of $20.676 million in the stock in Q4, up from 8 funds with a combined stake value of $8.59 million.

As of the February 23 market close, the stock’s dividend yield was 1.46%.\n\nFirst Pacific Advisors made the following comment about Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is one of the top two customer experience (CX) vendors globally. The company started off managing call centers but has since evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates the data, and optimizes a client’s customer interactions. CX is a relatively new business, and Concentrix has been acquiring smaller competitors. In March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player, for $4.8B in cash and stock.22 We believe the WebHelp acquisition will help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. The company was spun out from TD Synnex, another of the Fund’s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with the company’s innovation and growth.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Our last addition during the quarter was to the leading freelance platform, Fiverr International Ltd. The company’s revenue growth rates remain negatively impacted by macro factors as it’s relatively easy for customers to hire fewer freelancers when they must cut budgets in the near term. However, we are encouraged by the company’s rapid progress on the profitability front (with guidance for EBITDA margins to be approximately 16% for 2023 compared to 7% in 2022), early signs of revenue growth acceleration, and its significant long-term opportunity as freelance work continues growing. These factors present a positively skewed risk/reward opportunity for long-term investors, especially with the shares trading at a 9% FCF yield. We have therefore decided to add to our position.”\n\n7. Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nPerion Network Ltd.

        "title": "12 Best ESG Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds",
        "content": "In this article, we discussed 12 best ESG dividend stocks according to hedge funds. You can skip our detailed analysis of ESG investing and its prospects, and go directly to read 5 Best ESG Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe concept of ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, was initially introduced in a 2004 United Nations report titled \"Who Cares Wins.\" The term was coined with the intention of offering recommendations to the financial sector on how to effectively incorporate environmental, social, and governance factors into investment decisions, recognizing their potential to significantly influence the value of investments.\n\nClimate change remains a top priority for the majority of countries, investors, and international organizations. With the approach of 2050 and the increasing emphasis on globally agreed 'net-zero' commitments, addressing climate issues will become even more crucial. This agenda item is expected to gain significance, not only driven by public markets but also by the private sector. The significant focus on addressing climate issues has led to a notable increase in ESG-focused investments in recent times. According to a widely cited survey conducted by Morgan Stanley, over half of individual investors, approximately 54%, intend to boost their sustainable investments in 2024. Additionally, the survey indicated that more than three-quarters of individuals, around 77%, express interest in sustainable investing. The report provided the following observation regarding the trend in ESG investments over the years:\n\n“Even investors who know or assume that their sustainable investments underperformed their traditional investments in 2022 report growing interest in sustainable investing. This suggests that sustainability-focused investors tend to be more focused on long-term investment horizons and may not be deeply concerned by short-term fluctuations.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors lacked confidence in their ESG-focused investments in 2023, withdrawing a total of $5 billion from these funds in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a yearly outflow of $13 billion. This decline was attributed to poor performance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and challenges faced by an iShares fund, according to a report by Morningstar. While the outflows may seem concerning at the moment, they don't necessarily paint a grim picture of ESG investing overall. Despite these outflows and the fact that sustainable equity funds often trailed behind conventional peers in terms of returns for 2023, market appreciation helped bolster sustainable fund assets by the end of the year. The total assets in sustainable funds reached $323 billion by the close of 2023. This figure reflects a decrease of nearly 12% from the peak recorded at the end of 2021, but it marks an increase of 18% from the recent low point observed in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nOne prime example illustrating unwavering confidence in ESG investing can be seen through BlackRock's steadfast commitment to sustainable investment practices. Despite facing criticism from Republican circles, experiencing relatively modest returns, and observing a decline in client interest within the US, BlackRock Inc. has been discreetly expanding its influence in ESG investing. Data from Morningstar Direct reveals that BlackRock's assets under management linked to ESG surged by 53% from the beginning of 2022 to the end of the previous year. In comparison, the broader ESG fund market experienced only an 8% growth during the same period. Currently, BlackRock manages approximately $320 billion in ESG funds, surpassing any other investment firm in Europe, the US, or globally.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Visa Inc.

        "title": "Intel’s Double Whammy: A Chip-Making Duopoly and a Huge AI Advantage",
        "content": "With Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) poised to become one-half of a chip-making duopoly and the company also well-positioned to get a gigantic boost from the continued, rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence, INTC stock looks very attractive for long-term investors.\n\nMore specifically, Intel recently revealed that one of the world’s largest tech firms had agreed to use INTC to manufacture its chips. Additionally, the firm looks well-positioned to make a similar deal with one of the world’s largest, most famous semiconductor firms. And since duopolies are nearly always extremely lucrative for the firms that participate in them, Intel’s financial results should get a huge boost once it becomes one-half of a global chip-making duopoly.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm’s strong AI chips for servers, along with its chips for AI PCs and AI development, leave it well-positioned o thrive from the AI Revolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel Is on the Way to Participating in a Chip-Making Duopoly\n\nAs of March 2023, Taiwan Semi (NYSE:TSM) had produced more than 90% of the “advanced” chips used globally. But Intel is in the process of turning TSM’s monopoly into a duopoly.\n\nEarlier this month, Intel disclosed that it would manufacture chips for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) within the framework of an arrangement that will generate $15 billion of revenue for Intel. Of course, MSFT is one of the world’s largest tech companies overall and owns the second-largest cloud infrastructure developer Azure. As a result of Microsoft’s elite status, its decision to have Intel buy its chips is likely to spur many other major firms to make the same move.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leading designer of AI chips has decided to buy “advanced (chip) packaging” from Intel, starting next quarter. Also noteworthy is that Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that tests indicate that Intel’s chip-manufacturing processes are strong, and the CEO has stated that his firm is looking to hire more firms to manufacture its hardware. Also notably, Huang openly stated that “we’re open to manufacturing with Intel.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the latter points, I think it’s a matter of time before Nvidia starts paying Intel large amounts of money to make its chips. And in light of Nvidia’s status as the world’s largest maker of AI chips, I expect many more chip designers to follow Nvidia’s lead. This is great news for INTC stock.\n\nIntel Is Well-Positioned to Benefit Tremendously From the AI Revolution\n\nIntel’s server-chip business is already getting a big boost from the AI Boom, as the average selling prices of its Xeon server chips reached record levels last quarter.\n\nMoreover, the firm’s new Xeon chips, unveiled late last year, include “AI acceleration in every core, bringing leaps in AI and overall performance and lowering total cost of ownership,” the chip maker noted. Intel added that “Xeon is the only mainstream data center processor with built-in AI acceleration, with the new 5th Gen Xeon delivering up to 42% higher inference and fine-tuning” than its predecessor. The firm reports that changes made in the new version of Xeon allow computers to carry out their tasks more easily and quickly.\n\nIn the category of chips that will enable PCs to directly utilize AI, instead of relying on data centers to provide AI capabilities, Intel has launched Core Ultra. The chips will enable PCs to host “several hundred AI-boosted applications,” and Core Ultra uses 2.5 times less power than Intel’s previous, equivalent offerings. Also importantly, the chips will be integrated into 230 computer models this year, showing that computer makers are enthusiastic about the product.\n\nFinally, as I’ve noted in past columns, the backlog of Intel’s Gaudi chips, which are used to create AI, had exceeded $2 billion in January, showing that the demand for these semiconductors is extremely strong. This will be huge for INTC stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in INTC.

        "content": "Big tech's strong performance versus the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is often attributed to the success of the Magnificent 7 stocks. But it's really about three names this time around.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to start 2024. Nvidia has led the trio, surging nearly 60% compared to the benchmark index's 6% increase.\n\nThe three names have also topped the performance of their peers in the \"Magnificent 7.\" Microsoft (MSFT) has gained about 8% this year. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) have lost value through about two months of trade in 2024.\n\nThe stock moves are largely earnings based. In the current earnings season,Nvidia once again blew out expectations. Meta announced plans for a $50 billion share repurchase program and the company's first ever dividend. Meanwhile, Amazon surprised to the upside with its revenue metrics.\n\nOver the last 30 days as Wall Street analysts digested the latest round of corporate results from all seven big tech players, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia saw the largest increases in earnings projections for both the current year and next year, according to research from DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe,\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla and Microsoft negative earnings shifts were the only two of the group to see their earnings estimates move lower by more than the S&P 500 for next year.\n\nThe quarterly results of these companies are likely to shape the direction of the market at large. On Tuesday, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna wrote that big tech earnings per share estimates for 2024 have \"improved considerably\" and moved up the floor for total S&P 500 earnings projection this year.\n\nConsequently, the firm moved up its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,300 from 4,800 in part because of big tech earnings expectations. Goldman Sachs recently struck a similar tone in it's call for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"US Big Tech’s superior earnings estimate momentum versus the S&P 500 as a whole goes a long way in explaining why most of them have been able to continue to build on their [more than one] year run of outperformance,\" DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a note to clients on Monday night. \"As much as rates have risen this year, most Big Tech names are in considerably better fundamental shape than the broader US equity market.\n\n\"As long as they keep delivering on earnings results in the same manner as last quarter, most of these stocks should keep outperforming and driving the S&P higher.\" FILE - A Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look atCathie Wood Was Buying These 11 Stocks for 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Cathie Wood Was Buying These 5 Stocks for 2024.\n\nCathie Wood was again in the news recently after data from Morningstar showed that ARK ETF Trust lost about $14.3 billion in shareholder value over the past decade. Investors have also questioned Cathie Wood's decision to sell Nvidia in January 2023 just when the AI boom was taking off. Cathie Wood has clearly missed on the huge Nvidia rally, but she says investing in Nvidia was too easy and expensive. In May 2022 Cathie Wood in a tweet had said that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) was expected to transform how the world works.\n\n\"Within 6-12 years, breakthroughs in AGI could a accelerate growth in GDP from 3-5% per year to 30-50% per year. New DNA will win!,\" Cathie Wood had said.\n\nDespite her prescient thought process Cathie Wood failed to foresee the potential of Nvidia and instead kept on piling into stocks many of which are still money-losing. Was that a blunder or there's something the market is missing and only Cathie Wood can see due to her long-term horizon? Only time would tell.\n\nARK Innovation's Strong Performance in 2023\n\nDespite these performance gaps what is causing ARK investors to stick around? After all, ARK funds have not seen a mass investor exodus. One reason could be Cathie Wood's investment philosophy which almost always demands having at least five-year investment horizon. Perhaps ARK investors are patient and they are waiting for Cathie Wood's ambitious and futuristic bets to pay off. And these investors were also impressed with ARK's performance last year. ARK Investment Management's flagship ETF ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund ($ARKK) rallied about 70% in 2023. This was the fund's third best performance in a year on record since its inception in 2014.  ARK Innovation ETF is up 30% over the past one year.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Bloomberg report quoted Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital, who said:\n\n“I don’t think a single name has really hurt their brand,” he said. “It’s just a matter of performance with the fund. Things might perform better as Bitcoin appreciates.” Cathie Wood Was Buying These Stocks for 2024\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Investment Management Methodology\n\nWhile Cathie Wood's portfolio's top holdings include Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block Inc (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), for this article we decided to see which stocks Cathie Wood was buying for 2024. For that we scanned ARK Investment Management's Q4'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks in which the fund either increased its stakes or initiated new positions. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:NNOX)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $1,968,935\n\nTomographic imaging technology company Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:NNOX) ranks 11th in our list of the stocks Cathie Wood was buying for 2024.

(NASDAQ:NNOX).\n\nWhile Cathie Wood has missed on the Nvidia rally she did enjoy some gains from the latest jump in Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:NNOX) shares that came after Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:NNOX) revealed that Nvidia held an approximately $380,000 stake in Nano-X Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:NNOX).\n\n10. Pagaya Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:PGY)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $2,055,782\n\nIsraeli fintech company Pagaya Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:PGY) is part of the Cathie Wood's 2024 portfolio since ARK increased its stake in Pagaya Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:PGY) by 59% in the fourth quarter of 2023, entering the new year with a $2 million stake.\n\nPagaya Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:PGY) shares have gained about 15% year to date through February 26.\n\n9. Inmode Ltd (NASDAQ:INMD)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $2,068,075\n\nIsrael-based aesthetic medical products company Inmode Ltd (NASDAQ:INMD) is part of Cathie Wood's 2024 portfolio since ARK increased its stake in Inmode Ltd (NASDAQ:INMD) by 95% in the fourth quarter of 2023, concluding the period with stake worth over $2 billion in Inmode Ltd (NASDAQ:INMD).\n\nEarlier this month Inmode Ltd (NASDAQ:INMD) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.71, surpassing estimates by $0.04. Revenue in the quarter fell 5.1% year over year to $126.78 million, beating estimates by $1.93 million.\n\nLike Inmode, Cathie Wood also loves Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block Inc (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP).\n\n8. Pure Storage Inc. (NYSE:PSTG)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $17,356,792\n\nData storage solutions company Pure Storage Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) ranks eighth in our list of the top stocks in Cathie Wood's 2024 portfolio. ARK increased its position in Pure Storage Inc. (NYSE:PSTG) by 175% in the fourth quarter of 2023, ending the period with a $17.4 million stake.\n\nStifel analyst Matthew Sheerin recently cut the stock's rating to Hold from Buy, citing gains in the stock price since November.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds had stakes in Pure Storage Inc. (NYSE:PSTG), as per Insider Monkey's database.\n\nDuring Q3 earnings call in December the company talked about Q4 guidance:\n\n\"We have approximately $167 million remaining on our existing $250 million repurchase authorization. Now turning to our updated annual guidance for FY ’24. A key assumption used to derive our FY ’24 annual revenue guide at the beginning of the year was that the macro environment would not meaningfully improve or deteriorate throughout the year. This assumption is holding as the spending environment continues to be challenging. Though despite these challenges, we are seeing increasing demand in the second half of the year across our data storage platform especially for consumption and subscription service offerings. Although we expect the demand to increase for the second half of the year, there are two important factors that are impacting our annual revenue expectation this year, which we now expect to be $2.82 billion, growing 2.5% and Q4 revenue is expected to be $782 million, declining 3.5%.\n\nFirst is the impact of our Evergreen//One Storage as a Service momentum, which will be discussed in more detail. And second is the impact of a $41 million non-canceled product order with a telco customer that is not expected to be fulfilled until next year. Both factors on a combined basis represent approximately 4.5 points of incremental headwind when compared to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year. We are very pleased with the momentum and growth of our Evergreen//One service offering, while appreciating that this momentum creates a short-term impact on revenue growth. Last quarter, we stated that sales of our Evergreen//One service offering was expected to create 1 to 2 points of headwind to the annual revenue guide we provided at the beginning of the year.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n7. SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $19,608,883\n\nCathie Wood can't get enough of fintech and banking company SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI). She snapped up more shares in SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) during the fourth quarter of 2023, increasing her stake in the firm by about 144%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SoFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI).\n\n6. Nextdoor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KIND)\n\nCathie Wood's Stake: $20,388,364\n\nNextdoor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KIND) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks Cathie Wood was buying for 2024. Cathie Wood's fund increased its stake in Nextdoor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KIND) by 57% during the last quarter of 2023, ending the period with a $20.4 million stake in Nextdoor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KIND). The hyperlocal social networking platform Nextdoor Holdings Inc.'s (NYSE:KIND) shares have gained about 14% year to date through February 26. In addition to Nextdoor, Cathie Wood is also bullish on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Block Inc (NYSE:SQ) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP).\n\nNextdoor talked about guidance and future plans in an earnings call in November 2023.\n\n\"We are targeting a reduction in current GAAP personnel expenses of up to $60 million annually. These actions, while difficult, increase our focus on efficiency and will accelerate the path to quarterly free cash flow breakeven by the end of 2025.\n\nAs Sarah said earlier, the Q4 revenue growth acceleration we initially expected has not materialized to date. We now expect Q4 2023 revenue in a range between $50 million and $52 million and 2023 revenue in a range between $213 million and $215 million, which implies flat to slightly higher year-over-year growth for the full year. We expect a Q4 adjusted EBITDA loss in a range between $21 million and $19 million, which excludes the impact of one-time expenses related to our cost reduction plan. This implies a 2023 adjusted EBITDA loss in a range between $81 million and $79 million. One other note, we currently estimate that those one-time severance and related costs associated with our cost reduction plan will be approximately $12 million. Across many measures, Nextdoor’s growth and momentum continue.\n\nEven in an environment where important advertiser verticals have been pressured organic verified neighbor growth and engagement depth are accelerating. We are making continued progress transitioning to our proprietary ad platform and saw positive early results in Q3. And as we look ahead to 2024, we remain focused on growing WAU and revenue.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Cathie Wood Was Buying These 5 Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nCathie Wood’s Latest Stock Picks: 11 Biggest Positions These Cathie Wood Stocks Are On Sale Now 16 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 15 Years According to Cathie Wood’s Portfolio\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "ServiceNow, Hugging Face, and NVIDIA Release New Open-Access LLMs to Help Developers Tap Generative AI to Build Enterprise Applications",
        "content": "StarCoder2 - Created With the BigCode community and Trained on 600+ Programming Languages, Advances Code Generation, Transparency, Governance, and Innovation\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., February 28, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), Hugging Face, and NVIDIA, today announced the release of StarCoder2, a family of open-access large language models (LLMs) for code generation that sets new standards for performance, transparency, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nStarCoder2 was developed by the BigCode community, stewarded by ServiceNow, the leading digital workflow company making the world work better for everyone, and Hugging Face, the most-used open-source platform where the machine learning community collaborates on models, datasets and applications.\n\nTrained on 619 programming languages, StarCoder2 can be further trained and embedded in enterprise applications to perform specialized tasks such as application source code generation, workflow generation, text summarization, and more. Developers can use its code completion, advanced code summarization, code snippets retrieval, and other capabilities to accelerate innovation and improve productivity.\n\nStarCoder2 offers three model sizes: a 3 billion-parameter model trained by ServiceNow, a 7 billion-parameter model trained by Hugging Face, and a 15 billion-parameter model built by NVIDIA with NVIDIA NeMo and trained on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure. The smaller variants provide powerful performance while saving on compute costs, as fewer parameters require less computing during inference. In fact, the new StarCoder2 3 billion-parameter model also matches the performance of the original StarCoder 15 billion-parameter model.\n\n\"StarCoder2 stands as a testament to the combined power of open scientific collaboration and responsible AI practices with an ethical data supply chain,\" emphasized Harm de Vries, lead of ServiceNow's StarCoder2 development team, and co-lead of BigCode. \"The state-of-the-art open-access model improves on prior generative AI performance to increase developer productivity and provides developers equal access to the benefits of code generation AI, which in turn enables organizations of any size to more easily meet their full business potential.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The joint efforts led by Hugging Face, ServiceNow and NVIDIA enable the release of powerful base models that empower the community to build a wide range of applications more efficiently with full data and training transparency,\" said Leandro von Werra, machine learning engineer at Hugging Face and co‑lead of BigCode. \"StarCoder2 is a testament to the potential of open‑source and open science as we work toward democratizing responsible AI.\"\n\n\"Since every software ecosystem has a proprietary programming language, code LLMs can drive breakthroughs in efficiency and innovation in every industry,\" said Jonathan Cohen, vice president of applied research at NVIDIA. \"NVIDIA’s collaboration with ServiceNow and Hugging Face introduces secure, responsibly developed models, and supports broader access to accountable generative AI that we hope will benefit the global community.\"\n\nFine-Tuning Advances Capabilities with Business-Specific Data\n\nStarCoder2 models share a state-of-the-art architecture and carefully curated data sources from BigCode that prioritize transparency and open governance to enable responsible innovation at scale.\n\nThe foundation of StarCoder2 is a new code dataset called The Stack v2 which is more than 7x larger than The Stack v1. In addition to the advanced data set, new training techniques help the model understand low-resource programming languages (such as COBOL), mathematics, and program source code discussions.\n\nStarCoder2 advances the potential of future AI-driven coding applications, including text-to-code and text-to-workflow capabilities. With broader, deeper programming training, it provides repository context, enabling accurate, context-aware predictions. These advancements serve seasoned software engineers and citizen developers alike, accelerating business value and digital transformation.\n\nUsers can fine-tune the open-access models with industry or organization-specific data using open-source tools such as NVIDIA NeMo or Hugging Face TRL.\n\nOrganizations have already fine-tuned the foundational StarCoder model to create specialized task-specific capabilities for their businesses.\n\nServiceNow’s text-to-code Now LLM was purpose-built on a specialized version of the 15 billion-parameter StarCoder LLM, fine-tuned and trained for ServiceNow workflow patterns, use-cases, and processes. Hugging Face also used the model to create its StarChat assistant.\n\nBigCode Fosters Open Scientific Collaboration in AI\n\nBigCode represents an open scientific collaboration jointly led by Hugging Face and ServiceNow. Its mission centers on the responsible development of LLMs for code.\n\nThe BigCode community actively participated in the technical aspects of the StarCoder2 project through working groups and task forces, leveraging ServiceNow’s Fast LLM framework to train the 3 billion-parameter model, Hugging Face’s nanotron framework for the 7 billion-parameter model, and the end-to-end NVIDIA NeMo cloud-native framework and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM software to train and optimize the 15 billion-parameter model.\n\nFostering responsible innovation is at the core of BigCode’s purpose, demonstrated through its open governance, transparent supply chain, use of open-source software, and the ability for developers to opt data out for training. StarCoder2 was built using responsibly sourced data under license from the digital commons of Software Heritage, hosted by Inria.\n\n\"StarCoder2 is the first code generation AI model developed using the Software Heritage source code archive and built to align with our policies for responsible development of models for code,\" stated Roberto Di Cosmo, Director at Software Heritage. \"The collaboration of ServiceNow, Hugging Face, and NVIDIA exemplifies a shared commitment to ethical AI development, advancing technology for the greater good.\"\n\nStarCoder2, as with its predecessor, will be made available under the BigCode Open RAIL-M license, allowing royalty-free access and use. Furthermore, the supporting code for the models resides on the BigCode project’s GitHub page.\n\nAll StarCoder2 models will also be available for download from Hugging Face and the StarCoder2 15B model is available on NVIDIA AI Foundation models for developers to experiment with directly from their browser, or through an API endpoint.\n\nFor more information on StarCoder2, visit https://huggingface.co/bigcode.\n\nAbout ServiceNow\n\nServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) makes the world work better for everyone.

        "title": "Nvidia's Huge FCF Margins Imply It's Worth More",
        "content": "Nvidia Inc. produced blowout revenue growth and earnings on February 21 for its quarter ending Jan. 31. Quarterly sales were up 265% from a year ago and up 22% quarterly.\n\nBut the AI chip maker's results were also impressive due to its huge free cash flow (FCF) margins. The company said it generated $11.2 billion in FCF during its latest fiscal quarter ending Jan. 28. That represents 50.8% of total revenue of $22.1 billion.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nIn other words, over half of all its sales went straight into its checking account after all cash expenses. This includes all of capex spending, which was lower by $217 million in the quarter, as well as net changes in its working capital needs.\n\nIt's very possible that if these huge FCF margins continue, the stock could be worth substantially more, as much as 48% more. This article will discuss how that could occur, based on FCF margin and FCF yield metrics.\n\nFree Cash Flow Margins\n\nThis huge margin was significantly higher than last quarter when Nvidia made just $7.04 billion in free cash on $18.12 billion in revenue. That worked out to an FCF margin of just 38.9% compared to this quarter's 50.8% FCF margin.\n\nThis is clearly the result of operating leverage. That happens when a company's sales improve dramatically and its cash expenses don't rise commensurately. As a result, its cash profits are jacked up or leveraged higher.\n\nThis is due to the tremendous demand for Nvidia's AI chips, especially for use in data centers. The company's data center revenue was up over 409% to $18.4 billion, or over 83% of total revenue. For example, last quarter its data center revenue was $14.5 billion, or 80% of sales.\n\nMoreover, this is a truly astounding FCF margin for a tech company. Only a few tech companies, such as Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) have generated over 50% of their sales as free cash flow. I recently wrote an article in GuruFocus about this company.\n\nThis high FCF margin has huge implications for Nvidia's target price based on analysts' sales forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nForecast FCF and Target Price\n\nFor example, analysts now forecast that for the year ending Jan. 2024, sales will reach $104.5 billion and $121 billion by Jan. 2025. That implies that sometime in the next 12 months (NTM) the company will be on a run rate revenue forecast of at least $112.75 billion.\n\nSo, we can apply a 50% FCF margin, assuming Nvidia's latest 50.8% margin lowers slightly each quarter on average. That implies that the company will generate over $56 billion in FCF (i.e., $112.74b x 0.50 = $56.375b).\n\nThat is substantially higher than the company's quarterly $11.2 billion in FCF this past quarter (i.e., an annual run rate of $44.8 billion). This has huge implications for the company's stock price.\n\nFCF Yield Metric Implies Nvidia Stock is Worth Much More\n\nFor example, what if the company decided to pay out a dividend with all of its free cash flow? After all, its capex spending requirements are more than covered by the cash flow it generates.\n\nRather than have the cash pile up on its balance sheet Nvidia might want to reward shareholders. Nvidia does pay a dividend but it only costs the company $99 million. If it were to pay out all the $56 billion in dividends, what would happen to NVDA stock?\n\nNVDA would likely have at least a 2.0% dividend yield, and more likely a 1.0% dividend yield.\n\nIn other words, the FCF yield can be used to value Nvidia's market valuation. For example, if we divide $56.375 billion by 2.0%, the potential market capitalization of Nvidia would be $2,819 billion. Dividing by 2.0% is also the same as multiplying by 50x (i.e., 1/0.02 = 50), so if we multiply $56.375 billion x 50, the market cap would be $2.819 trillion.\n\nPrice Target\n\nThis market cap is 47.5% higher than today's market cap of $1.911 trillion. In other words, NVDA stock could be worth 47.5% more than its price of $778 per share, or $1,147.55 per share.\n\nAnd if the stock were to eventually have a 1.5% FCF yield, its market cap would rise to $3,758 billion (i.e., $3.76 trillion). That is 97% over today's price.\n\nKeep in mind that this assumes that Nvidia will continue to generate huge 50% FCF margins over the next 12 months and during 2025. That depends on its huge operating leverage. This could falter if the company's capex spending rises substantially. But so far, there are no indications that will happen.\n\nAnalysts are reviewing the company's finances, especially its huge FCF margins. They may come to the same conclusion that Nvidia is worth substantially more.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Berkshire and Lilly Race to Shake Tech’s Grip on Trillion-Dollar Club",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Big Tech stocks created, and have so far dominated, the trillion-dollar club in the US. For the first time, there’s a race brewing for an outsider to join their ranks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Apple's Scrapped Car Project Means AI and Headset Bets Are More Urgent\n\nRallies since the start of the year in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — which has its hands in businesses ranging from Dairy Queen to Fruit of the Loom — and weight-loss drug darling Eli Lilly & Co. have the two jockeying for a spot in that top echelon of S&P 500 stocks. The two firms couldn’t be more different — from each other and the tech giants they’re chasing.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has slowly but steadily marched upward to command a market valuation of nearly $900 billion. In contrast, the world’s largest drugmaker has momentum on its side after rapidly tripling in value over the past two years. A recent paradigm shift in how the world treats obesity has left Lilly’s value standing at more than $700 billion.\n\nAs Wall Street obsesses over the narrow breadth of the stock market’s ascent, the two firms provide a key foil for the so-called Magnificent Seven which have held sway over the market. Fascination with the tech giants has juiced their valuations and shot the S&P 500 well ahead of an equal-weighted version of the benchmark that dilutes the megacaps’ impact, leaving investors searching for fresh narratives outside of all things artificial intelligence-related.\n\n“You’ve got two other companies besides the tech names that are exciting to talk about,” said Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management. “It gets the conversation started that there’s a lot working within the market besides megacap tech.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“That’s generally a good thing — to highlight that there is in fact non-tech breadth out there,” he added.\n\nTortoise vs Hare\n\nBerkshire and Lilly have taken very different paths to their current valuations, climbing roughly 15% and 59% last year, respectively. While Buffett’s firm reported growing operating earnings from its medley of insurance, energy, railroad and other businesses, Lilly has skyrocketed on hopes for demand for its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nIf either stock were to replicate its 2023 gains in the months ahead, they would surpass a market capitalization of $1 trillion, joining the ranks of tech giants including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nSuch returns are never guaranteed, not even for the Oracle of Omaha, who reminded investors of that recently.\n\n“All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders over the weekend, cautioning that the company’s size constrains its ability to make needle-moving deals.\n\nStill, a deal could be one catalyst for the stock. “If it’s seen by the market as a smart play — which Warren Buffett typically does — they could make that bounce over the trillion-dollar goal line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nMeanwhile, optimism about Lilly’s prospects rose at Morgan Stanley where earlier this month analysts lifted their price target to $950 on the drugmaker, the highest on the Street. The bank’s analysts speculated on if Lilly would become the first trillion-dollar biopharmaceutical company, signaling there’s room for the stock to run higher.\n\nConsensus still implies a long road for Lilly to hit the $1 trillion milestone. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg have an average price target of $777 on Lilly, putting it at a less than $750 billion valuation over the next year, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nSky High\n\nLilly’s valuation premium may be behind Wall Street’s skepticism. The stock currently trades above its five-year average at about 57 times forward earnings, far higher than that of the front-runner of the AI revolution, Nvidia, or any of the other names in the Magnificent Seven with the exception of Tesla Inc. Meanwhile, Berkshire trades below most of the group on a price-to-earnings basis.\n\nCrossing the Line\n\nIn the US, tech giants have long ruled the thirteen-digit ranks. Apple first broke the ceiling in 2018. Microsoft recently eclipsed the $3 trillion mark and currently commands the highest market capitalization in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia has been flirting with the $2 trillion mark, while Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all trade above a $1 trillion valuation. Tesla joined the club’s elite ranks amid its feverish 2021 rally, but has since dropped out — a warning to future new conscripts.\n\n“When valuations become richer and richer, it doesn’t matter which company it is, which sector, the market becomes much more discerning and therefore more critical — and demanding more positive guidance during the earnings season,” said LPL’s Krosby.\n\nThe promise of new markets for its weight-loss treatments — ranging from heart failure to sleep apnea — is a likely factor in propelling Lilly toward the one trillion milestone, according to Shams Afzal, a portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel.\n\n“Lilly has truly become the unicorn in the space,” Afzal said. “It may not touch a trillion dollars this year, but the milestone is not an improbable one.”\n\nIf Berkshire breaks into $1 trillion territory, it will be in part due to the success of one of the tech giants it’s chasing: Apple is the top holding in the firm’s stocks portfolio after Buffett amassed a roughly $165 billion stake. Last year’s 48% rally in Apple shares bolstered that position.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Has 21% of His Portfolio Invested in 2 Brilliant AI Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller is the former manager of Duquesne Capital, a now-closed hedge fund that returned 30% annually without a single down year over a three-decade period. Today, Druckenmiller manages his personal wealth through Duquesne Family Office, but he remains an excellent case study for investors given his impeccable track record.\n\nAs of December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his $3.3 billion portfolio invested in two artificial intelligence stocks: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 9.1% and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) accounted for 12% of his invested assets. Those stocks have been brilliant investments in the past, but Druckenmiller clearly believes both will create value for shareholders in the future.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia impressed Wall Street with its fourth-quarter financial results. Revenue increased 265% to $22.1 billion on exceptional growth in the data center segment, driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income soared 491% to $12.8 billion due to an expansion of 10 percentage points in gross margin, driven in part by pricing power. CEO Jensen Huang said conditions are excellent for continued growth into 2025 and beyond.\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the gold standard in multimedia and AI computing. The company holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics chips, and more than 80% market share in machine learning processors. But Nvidia GPUs serve other purposes as well, such as accelerating scientific computing and data analytics. Collectively, the company controls about 98% of the data center GPU market.\n\nNvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services. The company is now realizing the benefits of that diversification. Networking revenue more than tripled in the fourth quarter, while software and services revenue achieved a $1 billion run rate. Additionally, Huang said in the third quarter, \"We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a significant advantage in its position as a full-stack AI computing company, meaning it brings together all the hardware, software, and services needed to build, deploy, and manage AI applications across private data center and public clouds. That strategy not only creates more opportunities to monetize existing customers, but also reduces friction for potential customers.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next five years. That makes its current valuation of 66 times earnings look tolerable. That said, the stock could nosedive if earnings grow more slowly than anticipated. Investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a few shares today.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft reported better-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 18% to $62 billion on especially strong growth in the cloud computing segment, supported by momentum in enterprise software. Non-GAAP net income increased 26% to $21.9 million due to disciplined expense management, among other factors.\n\nGrowth will likely slow in the coming quarters, but Microsoft remains well positioned to expand its business. The company dominates the enterprise software market due to strength in office productivity, enterprise resource planning, communications, and cybersecurity applications, among other categories. Microsoft accounted for 16.4% of software-as-a-service (SaaS) spending in 2022, more than twice as much market share as its closest competitor, according to the International Data Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has gained market share in cloud computing. Microsoft Azure captured 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, up about 2 percentage points from the prior year. CEO Satya Nadella said the reason for that increased market share was differentiated AI capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft has an exclusive partnership with OpenAI, such that Azure is the sole cloud provider for the company and the only cloud provider that offers access to OpenAI models like GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. Businesses can use those models to build custom generative AI applications fine-tuned with their own data. That value proposition could bring more customers to Azure in the future, possibly extending its market share gains.\n\nGoing forward, enterprise SaaS spending is forecast to increase at 13.7% annually through 2030, and cloud computing revenue is projected to grow at 14.1% annually during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at low-teens sales growth through the end of the decade. Meanwhile, disciplined expense management and share repurchases should support slightly faster earnings growth. Indeed, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 15% annually over the next five years.\n\nAgainst that consensus estimate, the company's current valuation of 37 times earnings looks a bit pricey, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. Microsoft is a wonderful company with reasonable growth prospects, but upside may be somewhat limited given its $3 trillion market capitalization. Additionally, I question whether the stock can outperform the market from its current price, so I would personally keep Microsoft on my watch list right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Still Hot, but These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Fizzle Out",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) became one of the hottest tech stocks over the past decade as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expanded. The chipmaker, which had previously generated most of its revenue from gaming GPUs, expanded into the data center space with more powerful GPUs that made it easier to process AI tasks.\n\nThat first-mover's advantage lit a fire under Nvidia's business as large companies upgraded their AI capabilities. As a result, its revenue grew at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) while its stock skyrocketed 16,570% over the past 10 years. Analysts expect its revenue to continue growing at a CAGR of 35% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThose growth rates suggest Nvidia remains one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular expansion of the AI market. Unfortunately, not every tech company that focuses on the AI market is destined to be a long-term winner like Nvidia. So today, I'll focus on two weaker AI stocks that could fizzle out even as the broader market expands: AI software maker C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and auto chipmaker Mobileye(NASDAQ: MBLY).\n\nC3.ai faces existential challenges\n\nC3.ai develops AI algorithms that can be plugged into a company's existing software to automate, streamline, and accelerate certain tasks. That strategy sounds promising, but it faces a lot of competition and generates about 30% of its revenue from a joint venture with the energy giant Baker Hughes. That deal is set to expire in fiscal 2025 (which ends in April 2025), and there's no guarantee it will be renewed.\n\nC3.ai's revenue rose just 6% in fiscal 2023, decelerating from its 38% growth in fiscal 2022 and broadly missing its original target of 22% to 25% growth. It blamed that slowdown on the macro headwinds and an abrupt shift from its stickier subscription-based plans to more flexible usage-based fees. C3.ai claims it can generate 11% to 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2024, but its habit of overpromising and underdelivering doesn't inspire much confidence in that optimistic outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast September, the company abandoned its original goal of achieving profitability on a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis by the end of fiscal 2024 (which ends this April) in favor of developing and marketing more algorithms for the generative AI market. That situation seems dire, yet C3.ai's stock still looks expensive at 10 times this year's sales -- even though it's dropped nearly 40% below its initial public offering (IPO) price. That's probably why its insiders sold more than 7 times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months.\n\nMobileye faces a severe cyclical slowdown\n\nMobileye, which was spun off from Intel in an IPO in 2022, is the world's top producer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which use chips, cameras, and sensors to help drivers park their cars, stay in the correct lane, and tap other semiautonomous driving features. These systems are powered by its own EyeQ computer vision chips, which are manufactured by its longtime partner STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM) instead of Intel's own foundries.\n\nMobileye might seem like a great way to invest in the growth of the connected and driverless vehicle markets, but it faces a rough slowdown. Its revenue rose 22% in 2022 and 11% in 2023, but it expects a 6% to 12% revenue decline in 2024.\n\nBack in 2021 and 2022, many of Mobileye's clients stocked up on too many EyeQ chips to insulate themselves from the supply chain headwinds. Mobileye also ramped up its chip orders from STMicroelectronics in the second half of 2022 to address its supply chain disruptions in the first half of the year.\n\nThose two factors caused Mobileye to suffer a supply glut of about 6 million to 7 million EyeQ chips at the end of 2023. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to plunge 51% this year as it slogs through those excess inventories.\n\nMobileye will likely recover from this cyclical downturn over the next few years, but its stock looks too expensive right now at 62 times forward earnings -- even after it lost nearly 40% of its value over the past 12 months. Intel, which still owns a majority stake in Mobileye, also sold a $1.5 billion stake in the company last year -- so it might be prudent to shun this out-of-favor chip stock until a few more green shoots appear.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Currently Held in Warren Buffett's $621 Million \"Secret\" Portfolio",
        "content": "Few money managers command the attention of professional and retail investors quite like the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Warren Buffett.\n\nSince becoming Berkshire's chief in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a jaw-dropping 5,080,168% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 23. For context, we're talking about a nearly 20% annualized return spanning six decades, which is roughly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nEven though the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors aren't perfect, their track record undeniably points to a history of recognizing plain-as-day values hiding in plain sight. This is why investors pay such close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA 13F offers a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the December-ended quarter). However, Berkshire's 13F doesn't tell the complete story of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings.\n\nWarren Buffett has a \"secret\" portfolio that contains two prominent Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nIn 1998, Buffett's company completed a $22 billion acquisition of General Re. While the reinsurance segment was the catalyst behind the deal, General Re also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire purchased General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM.\n\nBecause New England Asset Management continues to oversee more than $100 million in assets under management, it's required to file a 13F with the SEC every quarter. Although Warren Buffett isn't involved with the investing activity at NEAM in the same way he is with Berkshire Hathaway's $371 billion portfolio, the $621 million NEAM had invested as of Dec. 31, 2023 is, nevertheless, part of Berkshire Hathaway's aggregate holdings. In other words, New England Asset Management is Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, this $621 million portfolio held positions in 115 securities, which includes common stock, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and preferred stock. But what really stands out is this portfolio's stake in two of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThey are seven of the largest and most-influential publicly traded companies in the United States. I'm referring to:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have two lures. First, as you can see in the chart above, they have handily outperformed the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven provide sustained competitive advantages and/or virtually impenetrate moats.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is the leading global operating system, while its Azure has quickly become the world's No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services. Apple's iPhone is the clear leader in smartphone market share in the United States. Furthermore, Apple's share-repurchase program is unrivaled, with more than $600 billion worth of its common stock bought back since the start of 2013. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for up to a 90% share of GPUs deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated data centers in 2024. Amazon's marketplace captured a nearly 38% share of online spending in the U.S. in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search in January. It also owns Google Cloud, the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, and YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet. Meta Platforms' social media real estate is unmatched. Facebook is the most-visited site globally, and its family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only EV pure play that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nWarren Buffett's secret portfolio holds stakes in two of these seven companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures. NEAM closed out December with 18,200 shares of Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL), which were worth more than $2.5 million at the time.\n\nThe longtime draw for investors to Alphabet has been its foundational search engine. It's been nearly nine years since Google last accounted for less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search in a given month. As a virtual monopoly, it is able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power and take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion. Internet search should continue to be a healthy cash-flow driver.\n\nHowever, the company's most-exciting cash flow growth is liable to come from its smaller but substantially faster-growing segments. For instance, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income in 2023 after years of steady operating losses. Businesses are still very early in the cloud spending cycle, which suggests the high margins associated with cloud infrastructure services can really lift Alphabet's cash flow.\n\nSimilarly, YouTube's monthly active user count is marching higher. Daily views for Shorts (short-form videos that usually last less than 60 seconds) have climbed from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to north of 50 billion in early 2023. This represents an excellent monetization opportunity for YouTube, as well as another catalyst to spark an increase in high-margin subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet remains cheap, as well. Despite a sizable bounce from their 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be picked up for less than 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. That's a marked discount to the average multiple to cash flow of 17.9 that Alphabet has traded at over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt one time, Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio had a sizable position in Apple and owned shares of GPU giant Nvidia. But as of Dec. 31, 2023, neither company remained in New England Asset Management's $621 million portfolio. The only Magnificent Seven stock represented in that portfolio, other than Alphabet, is tech stock Microsoft. NEAM held 30,845 shares of the company as of Dec. 31, which equated to roughly $11.6 million in market value.\n\nThe reason asset managers are attracted to Microsoft is its exceptional cash flow, which is a function of its seemingly flawless operating model and pristine balance sheet.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Microsoft's success is a reflection of its blending the old with the new. Although its legacy Windows and Office segments are no longer growing much, if at all, they still generate exceptionally juicy margins that provide abundant cash flow. The company is able to use this cash to reinvest in high-growth initiatives or make acquisitions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Microsoft is betting its future on cloud services (including Azure), as well as the rise of AI. It has invested billions in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and is expecting longtail growth from the AI revolution.\n\nAnd Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. The company closed out 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's on pace for almost $99 billion in net cash generated from operations in fiscal 2024, based on the $49.4 billion of net cash it has generated through the first six months of its current fiscal year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Search for the phrase \"hot AI stocks\" using your favorite search engine, and you'll no doubt see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) mentioned -- and for good reason. Shares of the giant chipmaker have skyrocketed close to 240% over the last 12 months.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) is going through the roof. Companies around the world are scrambling to build AI applications, and the company's GPUs are the gold standard to power those apps.\n\nBut Nvidia is no longer just focused on chips. It now has a new $1 billion business.\n\nAn \"operating system for artificial intelligence\"\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress stated during the fourth-quarter earnings conference call that the company's software and services business achieved an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Nvidia AI Enterprise stands at the center of the company's software focus.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang described Nvidia AI Enterprise as \"an operating system for artificial intelligence.\" He emphasized, \"Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing.\"\n\nNvidia's customer base includes quite a few huge technology companies with large software development teams. Why would they depend on Nvidia for software instead of building their own?\n\nHuang said that despite these customers' scale, they still don't have the resources needed to handle the complexity involved with maintaining and fine-tuning their software stacks across all of their AI applications. He added that Nvidia will do it for them.\n\nHuang isn't exaggerating. Nvidia AI Enterprise serves as the software layer for the company's DGX Cloud AI supercomputing service. DGX Cloud customers include Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.\n\nEarly innings\n\nNvidia is still only in the early innings of building its software business. Huang said in the Q4 call, \"We're off to a great start.\" He added, \"[W]e're really just getting started.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe believes that software will be a much larger business for Nvidia over time. But just how big might Nvidia's software business grow?\n\nHuang said his \"guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are [sic] deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem [on-premises], will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs.\" With Nvidia charging $4,500 per GPU per year for AI Enterprise, that would translate to a massive amount of recurring revenue.\n\nI'm not sure if that grand vision will be achieved. However, I have no doubt whatsoever that software and services revenue of $1 billion is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nThis huge software opportunity isn't the main reason to consider investing in Nvidia, though. Software will likely continue to be the icing on the cake for the company's chip business, which accounted for most of Nvidia's nearly $61 billion in revenue last year.\n\nThe company's chip business should still have significant growth potential. Huang identified two key growth drivers for Nvidia that should extend into 2025 and beyond.\n\nOne is the ongoing transition from general computing to accelerated computing. He believes that the energy efficiency and speed offered by accelerated computing will entice organizations to convert all of their data centers over time.\n\nThe other major tailwind is generative AI. Companies in nearly every industry are building generative AI apps. Huang said that Nvidia has seen generative AI become \"a whole new way of doing computing\" that's driving the company's growth in a big way.\n\nWith these key trends plus a booming software business, Nvidia just might remain on the list of hot AI stocks for a long time to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Jackson Peak Capital, an investment management firm, released its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. As of Q4 2023, the company has completed ten months of investing activities since its March 2023 launch. Jackson Peak had a great quarter with a net return of +9.9% and a gross return of +12.0%. Following the pattern seen in Q3, broad equities markets fell in October before pulling back sharply to rebound in November and December. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.\n\nJackson Peak Capital featured stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On February 27, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $787.01 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 25.37%, and its shares gained 238.99% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.968 trillion.\n\nJackson Peak Capital stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"On the long side of the portfolio, a core theme we remain invested behind is the data center infrastructure buildout and AI chips arms race that we’ve discussed since our first letter in Q2. Some skepticism has crept into the market, and it’s understandable given the huge ramp in 2023. However, our research continues to suggest 2023 was the start of a multi-year platform shift. Value will accrue to varying segments of the AI value chain at different parts of the cycle. We continue to see value in the “boots on the ground” winners in the data center buildout (Vertiv, Modine Manufacturing, Celestica). Our positioning in AI semiconductor companies (NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD) has ebbed and flowed given we are cognizant (perhaps too much so) that these names are crowded positions across investor style types. We’ve done well in these chip stocks since inception and NVDA is currently a long, and we’re trying to “let winners run” while using sizing to risk manage these names due to the market-wide positioning bias in semiconductors.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. At the end of the fourth quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was held by 173 hedge fund portfolios, down from 180 in the previous quarter, according to our database.\n\nWe discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in another article and shared the list of stocks Jim Cramer was right about.

        "title": "SPRX: This Unknown ETF Returned Nearly 90% Last Year",
        "content": "With just $72.3 million in assets under management (AUM), the Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX) is tiny and unknown, but with a total return of nearly 90% last year, it’s worthy of more attention. I’m bullish on this new, under-the-radar ETF based on its eye-catching performance last year and its concentrated, compelling collection of growth stocks, which ties together an interesting collection of promising themes.\n\nWhat Is the SPRX ETF’s Strategy?\n\nThe Spear Alpha ETF is an actively-managed ETF from Spear Funds that “invests in companies benefiting from breakthrough trends in industrial technology.”\n\nSPRX’s aim is to find and invest in “underappreciated opportunities across different value chains that are beneficiaries of…” secular themes such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, enterprise digitalization, environmental focus and decarbonization, photonics and additive manufacturing, and space exploration. SPRX looks for long-term capital growth.\n\nEclectic Group of Holdings\n\nSPRX holds just 27 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 75% of assets, so this is not a diversified ETF. However, SPRX seeks to be an actively-managed, concentrated fund, so diversification isn’t really the goal. If the fund’s top picks do well, the fund is going to do very well, and if they don’t, it is going to perform poorly.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPRX’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, SPRX hits the theme of investing in generative AI through its top two holdings, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Nvidia makes up 11.9% of the fund’s assets, while Advanced Micro Devices accounts for 9.9%. These large positions paid off, as Nvidia is up 235.5% over the past year, while Advanced Micro Devices is up 124.1%. Within this theme, the fund also has a top 10 position in Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), which is up 53.2% over the past year.\n\nBeyond generative AI, the fund’s managers also clearly have a favorable view toward cybersecurity stocks, as Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), and SentinelOne (NYSE:S) are all top 10 positions.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPRX is also invested in a handful of software stocks, including Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), Confluent (NASDAQ:CFLT), and Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS). Electric vehicles appear to be another area of interest as the fund is invested in both Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).\n\nWhile the fund clearly skews towards technology stocks, interestingly, SPRX isn’t the type of fund that simply invests in the household name tech stocks and calls it a day. The fund notably has investments in several basic materials and metals and mining stocks, including Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and Albemarle (NYSE:ALB).\n\nThis is a smart area for a fund focused on electrification and decarbonization to invest in. SPRX’s managers clearly recognize that if the world is going to electrify more of its vehicle fleet and power grid, then copper from companies like Freeport McMoran and lithium from companies like Albemarle are going to be more in demand.\n\nI actually prefer investments in stocks like these to the likes of Rivian and other EV stocks because, unlike Rivian, they are making profits right now, they trade for inexpensive valuations, and many of them are also dividend stocks.\n\nAll in all, SPRX has an interesting portfolio and takes an omnivorous approach toward investing in what it sees as the major growth themes that it believes will drive the market, going forward.\n\nEye-CatchingPerformance\n\nSPRX only launched in 2021, so it doesn’t yet have a long track record of performance to evaluate it. The fund had a difficult 2022, losing 45.0% for the year as the market punished tech and growth stocks.\n\nHowever, it bounced back in resounding fashion in 2023, with a spectacular gain of 88.0%.\n\nWhile technology and growth stocks were up generally, SPRX’s gain of 88% still stands out, as its returns easily surpassed those of popular tech and growth-themed index ETFs. For example, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) returned 54.9% for the year, and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) returned 56.0%. To be clear, these are fantastic returns that any investor would be happy with, but SPRX still managed to beat them for the year.\n\nSPRX also outperformed perhaps the most popular actively-managed technology ETF in the market, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), which returned a stellar 67.6% in 2023.\n\nWhile it would be unreasonable to expect SPRX, or any ETF, to continue to put up these types of results, the fund looks promising based on what it has achieved thus far.\n\nWhat Is SPRX’s Expense Ratio?\n\nOne downside of SPRX is that its expense ratio of 0.75% is on the high side. This 0.75% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay $75 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nThat being said, this is a smaller, actively managed ETF, so it is unsurprising that its fees are high. It’s also worth noting that these fees aren’t out of line with other popular actively managed technology ETFs. For example, the aforementioned ARK Innovation ETF also charges 0.75%.\n\nIf the fund is performing well like it did last year, many investors won’t mind paying this expense ratio, but if its performance suffers a downturn, this fee could end up being a bitter pill for investors to swallow.\n\nIs SPRX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPRX earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPRX stock price target of $26.91 implies 8.1% upside potential.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSPRX is a small, under-the-radar, actively managed technology ETF that burst onto the scene with a return of nearly 90% last year, outperforming popular technology and growth index ETFs as well as popular actively-managed tech ETFs. The fund clearly warrants further attention from investors.\n\nWhile it would be unreasonable to expect it to continue to put up results at these levels, its track record so far is impressive, and it looks like it is continuing this momentum with a return of 9.9% thus far in 2024.\n\nI’m bullish on this ETF based on its supercharged performance and its intriguing portfolio, which brings in a variety of growth themes ranging from AI to the materials needed for vehicle electrification. SPRX brings a unique and omnivorous approach to growth investing that you don’t find in all tech funds, many of which buy large-cap tech companies and call it a day.\n\nIt’s important to note that as a small, actively-managed fund, SPRX is a pricey investment option with an expense ratio of 0.75%. If the fund continues to soundly outperform the market from here, this expense ratio will be water under the bridge, but these high fees could start to sting if the fund underperforms.\n\nGiven its short track record, high fees, and concentrated portfolio, SPRX is likely best suited for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Despite markets continuing at record highs, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management still identifies investment opportunities within long-term stocks. According to its recent filings, the respected investment house perceives potential upside in interesting companies, increasing holdings.\n\nThe top 5 Charles Schwab stocks include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stakes. These are the long-term stocks to which Charles Schwab allocates the most capital. Evidently, the prominent investment house remains highly confident in its substantial bet on Microsoft, having also purchased in the filing period. If one of the largest investment firms accumulates the long-term stock MSFT, it appears to be a sound investment for the long haul.\n\nBut beyond high-profile names, what additional long-term stocks may offer opportunities within the latest moves of Charles Schwab?​\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the largest holdings for many Charles Schwab investment portfolios focused on long-term stocks, Microsoft saw its shares increase substantially over the last year. The software giant experienced impressive growth of around 70% in its stock price during 2023. However, this level of growth has been common for Microsoft over the long term, with its shares increasing almost ten-fold in value in the past decade alone.\n\nCharles Schwab analysts believe that Microsoft can continue expanding its business and market share for many years. Even though some commentators worry about a tech bubble given high valuations across the sector, Schwab’s ongoing increases in its holdings of Microsoft shares show faith that the company remains well-positioned as a long-term stock pick.\n\nWith a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37x and an average price target of $456 per share, Charles Schwab continues to see upside potential in holding Microsoft as a core long-term stock within its client investment portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMerck (NYSE:MRK), one of the long-term stocks featured in recent Charles Schwab stock picks, has witnessed its P/E ratio expand considerably. From late 2023 through to the present, its valuation increased substantially from 19.4 to 71.\n\nThe company relies heavily on its cancer treatment drug Keytruda, which recently received expanded approval for use within the European Union. Analysts consider the now long-term stock to have further growth potential moving forward and also view Merck as well positioned to withstand a potential economic downturn due to the nature of its operations.\n\nAccording to its most recent quarterly disclosures, the Charles Schwab stock has received a sizable investment, totaling over half a billion U.S. dollars.​​\n\nVeralto Holdings (VLTO) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis relatively unknown long-term stock, Veralto (NYSE:VLTO) is among the newest additions to Charles Schwab stock holdings, standing out as the new pick in which Schwab acquired the most of, worth $91.5 million. The company provides water treatment and water quality solutions and posted relatively modest Q4 results last month.\n\nThe company saw sales increase by 3% over the last year and forecast similar growth for the coming year. Analysts also see modest similar growth in the company’s share price this year. Overall, it seems the interest in the long-term stock is based on expectations that it will deliver solid, albeit modest, growth in the coming years as water scarcity becomes a top concern when exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe company trades at a P/E ratio of 25.5x, slightly below the benchmarkS&P 500 index’s 27.6x times.​\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Was Right About These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Was Right About These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Was Right About These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer recently said in his program \"Mad Money\" on CNBC that people are asking him which stock would be the next NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Cramer said people believe Nvidia has \"made it\" since the stock has gained 236% over the past one year. Cramer acknowledged that it's really \"hard\" to find another such company that can post such an \"unbelievable\" revenue growth. Cramer reiterated that AI could be the \"gamer changer\" for \"everything\" that is digital.  Cramer said NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the \"freak of nature\" and the stock's dramatic rise in value has been difficult to digest for many because in the past companies like Apple and Microsoft rose to dominance relatively slowly, but Nvidia's market cap ascendance was unheard of.\n\nCramer then went to discuss which companies could join the $1 trillion market cap club soon. Cramer yet again sounded bullish about Eli Lilly because of the company's weight loss drug and Alzheimer's treatment. Cramer said these weight loss drugs make junk food less appealing.  Cramer also said Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment approval could come \"any day\" now. While Cramer believes Eli Lilly stock should see a sell-off in the near term, he thinks the company is headed to become the first $1 trillion market cap pharma company in the future. Jim Cramer Was Right About These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to take a look at the performance of Jim Cramer's stock picks. For that we first referred to our previous articles in which we covered Cramer's stock recommendations and calls made near the end of 2023 and early 2024.  We then calculated the performance of these stocks in 2024 so far to see whether Cramer was right or wrong about these stocks. With each stock we have mentioned its performance in 2024. Some top Jim Cramer's recommendations for 2024 were NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Let's see how they performed.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer's Stock Predictions and Their Performance in 2024\n\n10. Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Sell\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: -17%\n\nBack in August 2023, when Cramer was asked about his thoughts on Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) during a program on CNBC, he said that investing in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) was like “sending your money up in smoke.”\n\nRocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) stock is down by about 17% year to date through February 26.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023,  13 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB). The most significant stake in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) is owned by Jose Fernandez's Stepstone Group which owns a $45 million stake in Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB).\n\n9. Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Sell\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: -17%\n\nIn July 2023, Jim Cramer was asked about Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS), the California-based solid state lithium metal batteries company. Jim Cramer he would take a \"hard pass\" on the stock and there was \"nothing there\" about the stock.\n\nOver the past six months the stock is down by about 11%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Quantumscape Corp (NYSE:QS).\n\nEarlier this month the company posted Q4 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at -$0.23, surpassing estimates by $0.01.\n\n8. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +93%\n\nIn early January, Jim Cramer had said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) was doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"\n\nCramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) for his charitable trust.\n\nArm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have gained about 93% year to date through February 26. However, apparently this performance has run too hot for Cramer. He earlier this month said Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) was an example of market \"froth.\"\n\nLike Arm Jim Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\n7. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +22%\n\nJim Cramer was bullish on Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) when 2024 started. Here's what he had said about the aerospace engineering company when a caller asked him about this thoughts during a program on CNBC:\n\n\"What a stock Howmet is,\" Cramer said.\n\nCramer had said that investing in Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) was the \"right call.\"\n\nHowmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) shares have gained about 22% since 2024 started.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023,  43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM).\n\nThe company talked about its guidance in Q4'2023 earnings call:\n\n\"Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion plus or minus $100 million; EBITDA of $1.635 billion plus or minus $35 million; and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million plus or minus $15 million. I’d like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the Engine Products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth. In fact, let me expand. In fact, 2023, which was another year of above market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served.\n\nThis engine investment is viewed as excellent and speaks to the continued market growth in the business with 27%-plus EBITDA margins and a 33%-plus return of capital. And this continued growth is seen as the investments come on stream in approximately 18 months’ time. Underpinning all of this is an agreement with one of our engine manufacturer customers for increased business and increased market shares. This does not change our long-term commitment to deliver average free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. And as you can see from our guide, free cash flow after all cost is approximately 45% of EBITDA which is best-in-class. We based our guidance on Boeing 737 MAX production of 34 aircraft per month and six 787 aircraft per month. Our Airbus assumptions are in line with their plans.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +16%\n\nIn early January 2024, Jim Cramer had called GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) a \"ridiculously cheap\" stock. Cramer said that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) was doing \"so many great things.\" Cramer said at the time that when an analyst was downgrading the stock he was saying \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" on the stock.\n\nCramer also said that his Charitable Trust has a \"big position\" in the stock and he's sticking with the GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) stock for the \"long haul.\"\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) is up 16% year to date through February 26.\n\nIn addition to GE Healthcare, Jim Cramer also loves NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter the portfolio initiated a position in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC). GEHC is the former Healthcare division of GE, spun out in early 2023. It’s a global leader in imaging equipment such as MRI machines, CT scanners and ultrasound systems along with associated consumables. The business has a long and storied history but was trapped inside a larger, underperforming conglomerate, starved of the love and attention it needed to thrive.\n\nFrom a subset of value perspective, we view GEHC as a Low risk turnaround. The underlying business is fundamentally sound but has ceded market share over time, with sales growth lagging the industry. There is significant margin opportunity with core imaging margins (~50% of sales) much lower than its main peer. We see two drivers in restoring performance. Firstly an increase in research and development spending (since 2017 R&D spend is up 70%, far outpacing revenue growth). Secondly an opportunity to improve SG&A cost efficiency.\n\nWhat makes the turnaround low risk? Management and Board quality are critical. GEHC features a few of what we call ‘CI Alumni’; executives we have invested behind at other companies. Top of this list is Chairman Larry Culp, the former CEO of Danaher, an executive we have the highest respect for.\n\nGEHC has strong financial characteristics. It is a market leader in an oligopolistic industry where market share changes slowly and gross profit comes largely from aftermarket. The balance sheet is appropriately geared with well structured debt. Our analysis of GEHC’s accounts suggests there may be some conservatism baked into the P&L numbers. At today’s share price you don’t need to assume much going right to do well, which partially reflects the backdrop of healthcare stocks having been under pressure this year. If GEHC can deliver on its potential, the upside is significant.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Was Right About These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 Stocks Ready to Leap 50% as the Bull Market Returns",
        "content": "A big rally from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has re-excited many investors. Many stocks are up for the year alongside the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. This looks like a good year so far after a strong 2023.\n\nEven though numerous stocks are up for the year, the rally for some equities is just getting started. Some stocks look poised to leap 50% higher from current levels due to strong earnings and enticing growth prospects.\n\nThese are some of the bull market stocks to consider as investors start to feel optimistic about the stock market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthier sports drinks than the competition. The company removes many unhealthy ingredients that are common in many beverages. Celsius Holdings’ focus on health is attracting younger generations and rapidly expanding its market share.\n\nShares are up by 112% over the past year and gained 5,230% over the past five years. The stock would have to reach roughly $100/share to experience a 50% gain, and that growth is possible for the firm.\n\nCelsius Holdings is touted as the next Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), which has surprisingly outperformed every stock over the past 30 years. That’s right, a beverage company beat out all of the innovative tech giants.\n\nCelsius Holdings isn’t going to experience the same returns as someone who bought and held MNST stock for 30 years. However, the company can generate meaningful returns for investors thanks to high revenue and earnings growth rates.\n\nRevenue increased by 104% year-over-year in Q3 2023, while net income jumped by 146% year-over-year. Net profit margins exceeded 20%.\n\nAll of the revenue and earnings growth is coming from domestic sales. That’s the most exciting part about this stock. Celsius Holdings is just starting to penetrate European markets. Once it gets a good foothold in that continent, it can then set its sights on Asia. Celsius Holdings is a domestic winner and has vast potential as it taps into global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) would have to get to roughly $300/share to complete a 50% leap from current prices. Momentum and financials are both on this company’s side. Shares are up by 171% over the past year and have gained 2,361% over the past five years. Despite the big rally, the stock only trades at a 57-forward P/E ratio.\n\nI use the word “only” because revenue and earnings growth have accelerated. The company increased net sales by 85% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 while gaining 305 basis points of market share. Net income increased by 40.7% year-over-year, prompting the company to raise its fiscal 2024 outlook.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty is known for beating estimates, growing at a fast pace and improving profit margins. The company’s beauty products are also well-known, especially among Gen Z. The beauty firm does not use the unethical ingredients more common in other beauty products. It has achieved 20 consecutive quarters of sales growth, and the company is poised to extend that streak.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is a momentum stock that has crushed expectations and actually lives up to the hype. Shares are up by 234% over the past year and have gained 1,902% over the past five years. While the 1-year gain may sound excessive, the company reported 769% year-over-year net income growth in Q3 FY24.\n\nThe artificial intelligence leader can continue its rally as long as net income growth exceeds stock gains. A 265% year-over-year revenue gain suggests there will be more net income growth in future quarters.\n\nEventually, revenue growth will slow down, and we will have to get comfortable with high double-digit growth rates. However, Nvidia can report several quarters of high net income growth that further solidify its reasonable valuation. The company would have to reach about $1,180 to experience a 50% gain from current levels.\n\nNvidia has what it takes to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation and dethrone Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from that title. Investors have a lot to gain even from current levels if Nvidia realizes this goal.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH, ELF and NVDA.

        "title": "The market sage who warned about the dot-com bubble says another ‘may be forming’ right now over AI",
        "content": "The stock market is not yet in bubble territory, according to Jeremy Siegel, even with tech stocks surging this year amid enthusiasm over the rise of AI. But the veteran market watcher, who warned equities were a “sucker’s bet” before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, said he fears investors are still taking markets on a familiar, potentially dangerous path.\n\n“The beginnings of a speculative bubble may be forming but it is impossible to tell when it will end,” Siegel wrote in his weekly WisdomTree commentary Monday.\n\nSiegel, who retired from Wharton last week after a 45-year career as a finance professor, pointed to the meteoric rise in semiconductor stocks—which are seen as the vendors of the “pickaxes and shovels” of the AI revolution—as one example of bubble-like market behavior. To his point, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), which tracks U.S.-listed chip stocks, has soared over 57% in the past 12 months alone.\n\n“It is impossible to tell,\" Siegel wrote, \"whether semiconductors' action today is akin to 1997-98 and the internet—or more like 1995, like tech bulls think. Or 2000, like bears think.\" He compared the current rise of chip stocks to the internet darlings during the dot-com era.\n\nThe former professor did admit that tech stocks are “expensive” in general, but he also noted there’s a reason for that—earnings growth. As of last week, after 80% of S&P 500 constituents reported fourth quarter earnings, the tech sector saw earnings growth of more than 20% year-over-year, according to Fisher Investments. Wall Street expects that trend to continue as well, with analysts forecasting 17% year-over-year EPS growth and 9.1% revenue growth for the sector in 2024, according to Charles Schwab.\n\nNvidia, the special one\n\nDespite strong tech earnings, some analysts have argued that the meteoric rise of Nvidia, the semiconductor and graphics processing unit (GPU) giant, is evidence that a tech bubble is already here. But Siegel pushed back on that claim on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I do not think NVIDIA is dramatically over- or under-valued,” he wrote. “This has been a special company, and this is a special time when the demand for semiconductors is seemingly unlimited as the strong investment cycle is supporting chips and training new artificial intelligence (AI) models.”\n\nSiegel argued that not only can Nvidia “rise further,” but “much of the tech momentum may continue for some time.”\n\nHis comments echo those of billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who told Fortune that “we are not in a tech bubble” just last week. Cuban, who made a big chunk of his $7.2 billion fortune selling Broadcast.com before the dot-com bubble burst, said that there really aren’t many similarities between today’s stock market and that of the late ‘90s.\n\nBig tech valuations, while elevated, seem to back up Cuban’s argument. In March 2000, right before the dot-com bubble burst, the top 7 stocks in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite traded at nearly 90 times their forward earnings, on average. Today, that number is below 35.\n\nStill, at the end of the day, Siegel warned that “tech stocks momentum will run dry” eventually. “In a run such as this, the saying is ‘Stairs up, elevator down.’ And that elevator ride can be quite swift!” he warned.\n\nFor investors, Siegel argued that in spite of the threat of a bursting tech bubble, it’s important to focus on the long haul. After all, it’s “very difficult to time exits,” he noted, and no one wants to miss the big returns that come when a bubble is inflating.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 78% and 80%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Technology stocks experienced a robust recovery last year, and nowhere was that more apparent than with the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. These household names were among the top gainers in the Nasdaq Composite in 2023, pulling the tech-heavy index out of its slump and generating gains of 43% last year. The storied index now sits less than 1% below a new all-time high, which will check the final box signaling the onset of a new bull market.\n\nHere's how the collective performed in 2023:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): Up 239% Meta Platforms: Up 194% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): Up 102% Amazon: Up 81% Alphabet: Up 58% Microsoft: Up 57% Apple: Up 48%\n\nDespite these market-beating performances, some market watchers believe there's more to come. In fact, a duo of Wall Street analysts suggest that two of these stocks still have upside potential of 78% and 80% over the coming year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven buy No. 1: Nvidia\n\n78% implied upside\n\nThere's a strong argument that 2023 was the year generative artificial intelligence (AI) came of age, and strong adoption of these next-generation algorithms helped fuel last year's market recovery. Of all the Magnificent Seven companies, one has demonstrated its ability to profit most from this secular tailwind: Nvidia.\n\nThe company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that create lifelike images in video games, revolutionizing the industry. The innovation that made this possible was parallel processing. Simply put, these chips have the ability to process a magnitude of mathematical calculations simultaneously by breaking up the job into smaller, more manageable pieces. Parallel processing solved the workload problem for machine learning, an established branch of AI, and Nvidia quickly became the gold standard for AI applications. When generative AI burst on the scene last year, Nvidia adapted its processors for the next generation of AI.\n\nThe company just delivered its third consecutive record quarter and expects its triple-digit growth to continue. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending April 30), Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $24 billion, an increase of 234% year over year. The company was clear this runaway train is being driven by the rapid and accelerating adoption of generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite a stock price surge of 441% since the beginning of last year, some believe there's more to come. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann is the self-professed \"most bullish analyst on Nvidia.\" The analyst recently reiterated his buy rating on the stock while boosting his price target of $1,400, suggesting Nvidia could soar another 78% from here. The analyst justified the move by saying \"We are in the very early innings of what we call the Mother of All Cycles.\"\n\nThe analyst has previously echoed CEO Jensen Huang's assertion that AI will be the catalyst for a long-awaited upgrade cycle in data centers. With an installed base worth $1 trillion, this represents a massive opportunity for Nvidia, which controls an estimated 95% share of the market for GPUs deployed in data centers.\n\nWhile the bears suggest Nvidia is expensive, I'd respectfully say that view is myopic, as the most commonly used valuation metrics don't factor in the company's triple-digit growth. Nvidia trades at a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock. By that metric, it's the least expensive of all the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nMagnificent Seven buy No. 2: Tesla\n\n80% implied upside\n\nAfter a banner year in 2023, some investors have soured on Tesla. Yet the company achieved a number of remarkable milestones last year that suggest there's more to come. For example, the Model Y -- the company's most popular vehicle -- drove circles around the competition, becoming the world's best-selling car, according to online industry publication Motor1. In fact, Tesla was the first electric vehicle to ever top the list.\n\nTesla has consistently stated that its long-term goal is to increase vehicle production by a compound annual growth rate of 50%, but astute investors realize there will be ups and downs. Tesla's outlook for 2024 suggests it's in the down part of a cycle.\n\nManagement suggested that growth in 2024 \"may be notably lower\" than last year, saying that car sales are \"currently between two major growth waves.\" The resulting shareholder defections sent the stock tumbling.\n\nDespite the company's near-term prospects, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas continues to be Tesla's biggest cheerleader, assigning a Street-high price target of $345 while maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the stock. This suggests potential gains for investors of 80%, compared to Friday's closing price. He wrote that Tesla's forecast included \"almost no\" new information and management wasn't clear concerning what \"notably lower\" implies.\n\nIn a separate note, Jonas cited a survey suggesting that Tesla bears outnumber bulls by two to one, which highlights the \"seemingly overwhelming bearish institutional investor sentiment.\" He argues investors shouldn't view Tesla merely as a car company but as one with exposure to energy, AI, robotics, and more.\n\nGiven the company's success at revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry and track record of confounding critics, I think it would be foolhardy to count Tesla out now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- This earnings season has underlined that the big technology trade is here to stay, alleviating investor concerns that AI euphoria would falter after driving 2023’s market rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists BYD’s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Freddie Mercury’s London Residence Lists at £30 Million Shein Considers London IPO After US Resistance to Listing\n\nThe Magnificent Seven group of tech firms — which includes Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group has helped power the Nasdaq 100 index to a record high and its fourth consecutive monthly gain.\n\n“There’s more recognition that AI is so important and what we’ll be talking about for the next couple of years,” said Ken Mahoney, president and chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management. “We’re benefiting from so many technologies that it really makes value stocks look pretty boring at the moment.”\n\nBefore the season started, Wall Street expected fourth quarter 2023 earnings per share to grow about 1.2%. Through Friday, after nearly 93% of companies have reported, earnings per share growth is 7.7%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWhen it comes to tech, investors remain bought into the idea that the biggest companies are both a haven and growth asset. The largest firms have solid balance sheets and cash flows that have helped them navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and higher interest rates. Cost discipline has also been key, with Meta shares surging earlier this month after it announced $50 billion in buybacks and declared its first-ever dividend.\n\n“That was a microphone drop. When a company can buy back $50 billion worth of stock, it’s crazy,” said Mahoney.\n\nSigns of continued dominance in the AI field from the likes of Nvidia have provided a boost. Its blowout earnings report last week lifted the entire market, while illustrating that the firm’s earnings have been growing at a greater pace than the shares — which saw the biggest ever single-session increase in market value Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon was also rewarded after it reported momentum in its cloud business and gave an operating income outlook that bested Wall Street expectations. “Outside of Nvidia, that’s our expectation for top performer,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.\n\nRead more: What Bubble? Nvidia Profits Are Rising Even More Than Its Stock\n\nOf course, not all of the Magnificent Seven stocks beat earnings expectations, or saw their shares immediately rise after reports. Apple shares came under pressure after its results showed slowing demand in China, but later recovered. Alphabet Inc.’s report also gave investors pause after it showed that search advertising revenue that failed to meet analyst estimates.\n\nTesla Inc. missed Wall Street estimates for its quarterly results and warned that it sees a lower rate of expansion this year, weighing on shares already under pressure. The slump has trimmed around $155 billion from Tesla’s market value this year, and it’s among the worst performers in the S&P 500.\n\nNot everyone has counted it out, however.

Artificial intelligence is likely to replace or at least lend a hand in tasks that take up almost three-quarters of the time bank employees now spend working. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led the largest single financing round for a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, the latest in a string of sizable investments that suggest the e-commerce firm is again deploying capital in the hunt for growth.

        "title": "Best Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas of Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street was upbeat last week, fueled by Nvidia's stellar earnings report. The S&P 500 added 1.7%, the Dow Jones advanced 1.3% and the Nasdaq gained 1.4% last week. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones hit fresh records while the Nasdaq Composite ended Friday down slightly, marking a pause in the market's meteoric rise.\n\nNvidia's Ascendancy and Market Impact\n\nNvidia's blowout earnings report sent a spell of rejoice through Wall Street, propelling the AI chipmaker to new heights. The company's market value skyrocketed by $277 billion in a single day, marking the largest single-day gain in Wall Street history. With Nvidia's shares continuing to surge, the company is now on the brink of achieving a monumental $2 trillion valuation, solidifying its position as a dominant force in the semiconductor industry and a key player in the AI revolution.\n\nFederal Reserve Signals on Interest Rates\n\nAmidst the market frenzy, attention has turned to the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. While a parade of Fed officials has hinted at future rate cuts, they differ on the timing of such moves. Despite indications of impending cuts, investors are now reassessing their expectations, with Goldman Sachs revising its projections downward (per a Yahoo Finance article). The consensus now points to three rate cuts for 2024, down from previous expectations of six, as inflation data and cautious Fed comments prompt a recalibration of market forecasts.\n\nEarnings Season Highlights and Market Reaction\n\nAs the fourth-quarter earnings season winds down, several companies have delivered standout performances, beating estimates and driving significant market movements. Among recent releases, Block's SQ upbeat earnings forecast fueled a 16% surge in its shares, while Carvana's CVNA announcement of its first annual profit propelled its stock up by approximately 30%. These positive earnings reports have contributed to the overall bullish sentiment in the market on Friday, reflecting investor optimism about the economic outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nWinning ETF Areas\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETF areas of last week.\n\nNvidia-Heavy ETFs\n\nGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) – Up 14.7%\n\nT-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) – Up 14.6%\n\nThe semiconductor giant Nvidia exceeded Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations on Wednesday. This announcement not only showcased Nvidia's robust position in the AI chip market but also signaled promising prospects for the semiconductor industry in 2025 and beyond. The stock was up 6.4% last week, boosting the leveraged ETFs.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdvisorShares MSOS 2x Daily ETF (MSOX) – Up 14.2%\n\nCannabis stocks rose last week as Germany takes a huge step toward the broad legalization in Europe. Germany could become the largest country in Europe to legalize cannabis in 2024. German lawmakers on Friday approved a government plan to liberalize rules on cannabis, paving the way for the country to decriminalize limited amounts of marijuana and allow members of “cannabis clubs” to buy it for recreational purposes, and the move would take effect from April 1.\n\nChina\n\nDirexion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X Shares (YINN) – Up 13.1%\n\nChina ETFs have been gaining due to easy money policy. In January, China said that Starting Feb. 5, the People’s Bank of China will allow banks to hold smaller cash reserves, as quoted on CNBC. Cutting the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points will likely to release 1 trillion yuan ($139.8 billion) in long-term capital (read: Will China ETFs Rebound in Year of Dragon?).\n\nHomebuilders\n\nDirexion Daily Homebuilders & Supplies Bull 3X Shares (NAIL) – Up 10.3%\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) experienced a notable increase, climbing 4 points to reach 48 in February. This improvement marks the third successive month of positive sentiment in the housing market and represents the highest level of confidence since August 2023 (read: Homebuilders' Confidence Up for 3 Months in Row: ETFs in Focus).\n\nInverse Auto\n\nMAX Auto Industry -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN (CARD) – Up 8.8%\n\nThe stock Tesla lost 5.1% last week. Tesla has been witnessing weakness lately. In fact, the electric vehicle space has been under pressure for quite some time now. This has probably led to the surge in the inverse leveraged auto ETF.\n\n(Disclaimer: This article has been written with the assistance of Generative AI.

        "content": "ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. ADTN reported soft fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein both the bottom line and the top line missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company recorded a top-line contraction year over year due to geopolitical tension, forex volatility and tough competition from other players in the market.\n\nNet Income\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the net loss in the December quarter was $109.9 million or a loss of $1.40 per share against an income of $38.9 million or 49 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to revenue contraction and an income tax benefit in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net loss was $85.9 million or a loss of $1.09 per share against net income of $70.8 million or 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The loss was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the GAAP loss was $267.6 million or a loss of $3.41 per share compared with a loss of $2 million or a loss of 3 cents per share in 2022. Non-GAAP net loss in 2023 was $118.6 million or a loss of $1.51 per share against net income of $82.6 million or $1.32 per share in 2022.\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nADTRAN Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ADTRAN Holdings, Inc.

The top line missed the consensus estimate of $232 million. In 2023, revenues improved to $1.15 billion from $1.03 billion in 2022.\r\n\r\nNetwork Solutions contributed $180.4 million in revenues compared with $317.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The persistence of an unfavorable macroeconomic environment and forex volatility in the international market constrained the capex spending from customers. Services and Support revenues were $45.1 million, up from $40.8 million a year ago. Healthy demand for its professional services supported the growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nTotal cost of sales decreased from $250.9 million to $147 million.

        "content": "On Feb 26, Bitcoin (BTC), reclaimed the $57,000 level for the first time in more than two years. The cryptocurrency market, which rebounded last year, has carried the rally into 2024. It is poised to continue the rally in the near term.\n\nThe world’s most popular cryptocurrency jumped as much as 4.4% on Monday to hit $57,039 before paring some of the gains to settle at around $56,400. Bitcoin’s price has surged 32% year to date, primarily driven by investor demand through exchange-traded funds (ETF).\n\nNeedless to say, the January approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, has been one of the most important events in the history of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe approval of the spot Bitcoin ETF was intended to propel cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, providing a sustained boost to the cryptocurrency sector in the long run. Cryptocurrency prices saw a recline in the days following the SEC approval but it appears that the aim with which it was approved is finally bearing fruit.\n\nMoreover, the halving event for Bitcoin will likely happen in April, which is expected to reduce the mining reward for the new blocks by half. Historically, this occurrence has intensified scarcity, posing challenges for miners to obtain a net increase in Bitcoins. Usually, Bitcoin’s value typically jumps because of the constrained supply.\n\nOur Choices\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 63.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 7.6% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 173%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 253% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 2.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 60 days. CME presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. BLK is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 4.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last 60 days.

        "content": "'Fail quickly and inexpensively': Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang shares his mantra for success — here's why Jim Cramer calls him a bigger visionary than Elon Musk\n\nIt's no secret that CNBC’s Jim Cramer holds Nvidia (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang in high esteem. After all, the “Mad Money” host once hailed Huang as “the da Vinci of tech.”\n\nBut how does Huang compare to Elon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur celebrated for revolutionizing transportation on Earth with Tesla and in space with SpaceX?\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in.

Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)\n\nIn a recent CNBC segment, Cramer faced the question of whether he sees Huang as “a bigger visionary” than Musk. His answer was unequivocally affirmative.\n\n“Yes, and I’ll tell you why,” Cramer explained. “I think that Musk can see around the corner. But I think that Jensen is thinking about a legacy of changing the entire paradigm about the way the world is. Jensen is creating single handedly an industrial revolution.”\n\nCramer's remarks followed Nvidia's announcement of exceptional quarterly results. The chip giant reported that its Q4 revenue surged by 265% year-over-year, while its earnings per share skyrocketed by 765%.\n\nNvidia shares shot up 16% after earnings. Over the last 12 months, the stock has seen a gain of over 236%.\n\nWhile shareholders are celebrating Nvidia's massive success, it might be worth noting that the company's innovative leaps are grounded in a philosophy that embraces “a tolerance for failure.”\n\nRules for failing\n\nHuang earned his master’s degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1992. In 2011, he returned to his alma mater to deliver a lecture on the challenges and rewards of building a company.\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to his discourse was the concept of failure.\n\n“If you want to be successful, I would encourage you to grow a tolerance for failure,” he stated.\n\nHowever, Huang clarified that he's not advocating for failure per se.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\n“If you fail often enough, you actually might become a failure — and that's different than being successful,” he explained. “So the question is, how do you teach someone how to fail, but fail quickly? And to change courses as soon as you know it's a dead end?”\n\nThe answer, according to Huang, is something called intellectual honesty. The approach is straightforward: “We assess on a continuous basis whether something makes sense or not. And if it's the wrong decision, let's change our mind.”\n\nHe contended that to create a company capable of inventing “amazing things that solves problems for the world that it sometimes didn't even know it had,” building a tolerance for risk-taking is crucial. At the same time, it’s also essential to “teach people how to fail but fail quickly and inexpensively.”\n\nAccording to Huang, this mindset is vital because innovation is predicated on experimentation, which necessitates exploration, and exploration may lead to failure.\n\n“Unless you have a tolerance for failure, you will never experiment and if you don't ever experiment, you will never innovate. If you don't innovate, you don't succeed,” he concluded.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nHere's how you can invest in rental properties without the responsibility of being a landlord ‘The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' — here's what he likes for protection 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "In the current bullish stock market, it’s an exhilarating period for savvy investors betting on the upcoming market sensations.\n\nThe optimism is connected to the S&P 500 shattering the historic 5000 threshold, supported by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s bullish projection of 2.9% growth in the first quarter (Q1). As the market seems ready to embrace risk, now is perhaps an opportune time for investing in high-potential market sensations.\n\nThis climate of uncertainty presents a chance for the forward-thinking long-term investor to capitalize on long-term bets trading at highly attractive levels. That said, we spotlight three enticing stocks that, while potentially speculative, hold promise for stellar gains in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArdelyx (ARDX) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nOver the past year, biopharma player, Ardelyx (NASDAQ:ARDX) has witnessed a remarkable 182% surge in value. Perhaps whats backing the bullish narrative around ARDX, is XPHOZAH, catering to patients with hyperphosphatemia. According to Future Market Insights, The hyperphosphatemia treatment market is expected to grow from $12.7 billion in 2023 to $20.2 billion by 2033, with a CAGR of roughly 4.8%.\n\nMoreover, top nephrologists surveyed by the firm express a high intention to adopt XPHOZAH within the first six months of its availability, a heartening reception from the medical community. Stellar ratings across novel mechanisms, efficacy, tolerability, and dosing attributes reinforce this positive sentiment.\n\nDespite lower fourth-quarter revenue and EPS, the company’s irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) drug IBSRELA continued to impress. It posted a remarkable 22% quarter-over-quarter surge in net sales, reaching an impressive $28.1 million. Echoing this confidence, TipRanks analysts assign Ardelyx a ‘strong buy’ rating with a robust 47% upside potential.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Chatbot conversation Ai Artificial Intelligence technology online customer service. Digital chatbot, robot application, OpenAI generate. financial investment stock market. Virtual assistant on internet. AI stocks\n\nSource: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) has seen its shares skyrocket by 85% year-to-date (YTD), triggered by an investment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Despite the relatively modest size, the disclosure of Nvidia’s $3.7 million investment in SoundHound AI sent the SOUN stock’s price to the moon.\n\nRegardless of the size of the investment, Nvidia strongly suggests the company’s belief in SoundHound AI’s leadership in the emergent conversational AI space. SoundHood has grown its top line at a rapid pace, delivering a massive 43% YOY growth, outpacing analyst estimates in the past couple of quarters. Furthermore, estimates suggest that the global conversational AI market size could grow by 23.6% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $41.4 billion by 2030. Such a massive total addressable market is a testament to SOUN stock’s long-term growth potential.\n\nMoreover, TipRanks analysts underscore this sentiment, assigning SoundHound AI a ‘strong buy’ rating, with a projected 19.13% upside potential and an average price target of $4.67.\n\nAdverum Biotechnologies (ADVM) Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Champhei\n\nAdverum Biotechnologies (NASDAQ:ADVM), is a pioneering force in gene therapy innovations, with a distinct focus on ocular and rare diseases. Valued at under $3, the company has experienced an impressive 185.7% YOY increase, marking a clear growth trajectory. Additionally, its market capitalization has jumped from $76 million in 2023 to $200 million in 2024, reflecting a robust 169.7% bump in value.\n\nAdvancing through the LUNA trials, ADVM has investors eagerly awaiting critical data, with regards to the safety and efficacy, presenting a potential game-changer in gene therapy. Interim data from the phase 2 LUNA study for Wet age-related macular degeneration shows promising signs of robust clinical activity. Specifically, the study shows a reduction in treatment burden and maintaining visual and anatomical outcomes in difficult patient groups.\n\nMoreover, the anticipation is heightened by the prospect of breakthrough results, further emphasized by TipRanks analysts assigning a ‘moderate buy’ and projecting an enticing 100% upside potential with an average price target of $4. As the company approaches this critical juncture, investors can wager on this high-risk high-reward play. This makes it one of those market sensations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Up to 203% Upside, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Over the past three decades, there's always been a next-big-thing trend to captivate investors' attention. For the moment, nothing is causing more excitement within the investing community than the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI utilizes software and systems to oversee tasks that would normally be handled by humans. What makes AI special is the incorporation of machine learning, which is what allows software and systems to evolve and become smarter over time. With practical application across virtually all sectors and industries, artificial intelligence is expected to add more than $15 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) by the turn of the decade, according to researchers at PwC. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe astronomical dollar figures attached to AI solutions aren't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Most analysts anticipate continued upside in AI stocks over the next year -- and that includes leading megacap stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia may not offer the highest upside among AI stocks\n\nAccording to analyst Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital, shares of Nvidia can catapult to $1,200, which would imply 52% upside from where the stock closed on Feb. 23, 2024. This would effectively tack on $1 trillion in market cap and potentially make Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\nBaruah's optimism likely stems from Nvidia's dominant position as the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for as much as 90% of the share of GPUs used in high-compute data centers in 2024. With demand clearly outpacing supply, and Nvidia enjoying a boatload of near-term pricing power, it's been able to easily surpass Wall Street's consensus sales and profit forecasts.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is also set to face numerous headwinds this year. As I outlined recently, it'll be contending with growing external competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as well as internal competition. Nvidia's two largest customers, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, are developing AI-fueled data-center chips of their own.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, there's the real possibility Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as A100 and H100 GPU production ramps. If GPU scarcity wanes, the pricing power that's been primarily responsible for powering Nvidia's data-center sales higher could shift into reverse.\n\nEven though Baruah at Loop Capital believes Nvidia's stock could deliver a 52% return from where it closed last week, three other AI stocks offer higher upside, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBaidu: Implied upside of 89%\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes can outpace Nvidia to the upside is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). According to Fawne Jiang at Benchmark, Baidu stock can reach $210 per share, which would imply upside of 89% relative to where it closed on February 23.\n\nMost investors are familiar with Baidu because of its dominant internet search engine in China. In January, Baidu accounted for 61% of internet search in the world's No. 2 economy by GDP. With few exceptions, Baidu has been responsible for between 60% and 85% of China's internet search share over the past nine years. This makes it a logical go-to for advertisers, which has helped it maintain strong ad-pricing power.\n\nHowever, Baidu's future is very much dependent on the success of AI. The company's AI Cloud and world-leading autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, have delivered consistently superior growth rates when compared to the company's foundational internet search segment. In particular, generative AI solutions offer businesses a means to tailor their ads to the wants and needs of specific users.\n\nJiang's price target of $210 isn't outrageous, either. Given Baidu's historic double-digit growth rate, its $27.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (as of Sept. 30), and its remarkably low forward-year earnings multiple of just 10, non-online marketing revenue could realistically push Baidu's stock to $210.\n\nMobileye Global: Implied upside of 203%\n\nAnother AI stock that may have investors completely forgetting about Nvidia is Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY), a developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions. Analyst Itay Michaeli of Citigroup believes Mobileye Global stock can more than triple to $72 per share.\n\nNext-generation vehicles are incorporating technology like never before. Mobileye's SuperVision is currently its most-advanced ADAS offering. Though it still requires the full attention (and potential intervention) of a driver, SuperVision is a hands-off solution that can handle lane changes, accelerating and decelerating, and provide evasive maneuver assistance, and point-to-point automated navigation of an autonomous vehicle. As cars become \"smarter,\" Mobileye's solutions are bound to become more popular.\n\nSomething else working in Mobileye's favor is that the company was profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) during the fourth quarter. Mobileye landed $7.4 billion in future orders in 2023 and also has $1.21 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the ready, as of Dec. 30, 2023. Not only should the company have little trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate during long-winded periods of U.S. economic growth, but it has the capital needed to continue innovating.\n\nWhile Mobileye Global has developed undeniably exciting technology, and majority shareholder Intel would be thrilled to see its share price soar, the growing possibility of a recession taking shape in the not-too-distant future makes a $72 price target a tough sell in 2024.\n\nTesla: Implied upside of 64%\n\nThe third AI stock that offers even more upside than Nvidia, at least based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently reiterated his belief that Tesla's stock can reach $315 per share, which would represent 64% upside from where shares ended on Feb. 23.\n\nAI solutions are critical to the EVs Tesla sells and leases. The company's Autopilot software relies on cameras, sensors, and other solutions to cull data from the car's surroundings, which are needed to make split-second driving decisions. Tesla has ridden its first-mover advantages in the EV space to become North America's leading EV manufacturer. The company produced just shy of 1.85 million EVs in 2023, while delivering its fourth consecutive year of GAAP profits.\n\nBut unlike Baidu, which has a very reasonable high-water price target, the lofty perch Dan Ives' price target sits atop appears unreachable due to mounting headwinds for Tesla. The company has slashed prices for Models 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. These cuts are in response to weakening EV demand, fierce competition, and rising inventory levels as Tesla's production expands. Although Tesla is selling more vehicles, its operating margin has been more than halved to 8.2% in a little over a year.\n\nTesla's ambitions to become more than a car company have fallen flat, too. Growth in the company's Energy Generation and Storage segment has stalled on a sequential quarterly basis, while Services gross margin came in below 3% in Q4. Tesla is almost entirely reliant on selling and leasing EVs to generate a profit. This is a problem considering that Tesla trades at north of 60 times consensus earnings in 2024 in an industry known for single-digit, price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

The stock was flailing until Nvidia submitted its 13F-HR filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb.14. That filing revealed that Nvidia had bought more than 1.73 million shares of SoundHound AI.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia's investment in SoundHound amounted to pocket change for the huge GPU maker. There were also four other AI stocks listed in the regulatory filing, two of which were much bigger purchases for Nvidia. However, many investors saw Nvidia's initiation of a position in SoundHound AI as something of an endorsement of the small company.\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Nvidia invested in SoundHound AI. In 2017, Nvidia, along with several other investors, funded a $75 million capital raise for the small company when it was still privately held.\n\nWhy SoundHound AI is intriguing\n\nI think SoundHound AI is without question an intriguing company. It has built an impressive customer base in recent years thanks to voice AI technology that is arguably the best available.\n\nSoundHound AI has been especially successful in the automotive industry. A \"who's who\" of automakers use its AI platform, including Honda, Hyundai, Kia, and the Stellantis family of cars (Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroen, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Opel, and Peugeot).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has also made significant inroads in the restaurant market. Its partners include Beef O'Brady's, Krispy Kreme, Oracle Food and Beverage, Toast, and White Castle.\n\nSoundHound estimates its total addressable market at more than $160 billion. In addition to automotive and restaurant applications, the company is actively going after opportunities in entertainment and the Internet of Things markets. It also hopes to target financial services, healthcare, retail, and more.\n\nThe company is growing by leaps and bounds. In the third quarter of 2023, SoundHound AI's revenue soared 19% year over year and 52% sequentially. It also achieved a strong gross margin of 73%.\n\nShould you buy SoundHound AI stock before Thursday?\n\nSoundHound provided a wide Q4 revenue guidance range in November of between $16 million and $20 million. The company also expects to generate positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in Q4. If SoundHound trounces the average analysts' estimate of $17.75 million and achieves its EBITDA goal, its shares could take off.\n\nSo should you buy SoundHound AI stock before the company's Q4 update on Thursday? I wouldn't go that far. Scrambling to buy SoundHound AI quickly in an attempt to score a huge gain on better-than-expected quarterly results is a gamble.\n\nOn the other hand, SoundHound does have a big long-term opportunity with its voice AI technology. It's continuing to deliver solid growth. If you're an aggressive investor seeking an AI stock that's still small, I think that SoundHound AI is worthy of a serious look.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 ETFs with Big Nvidia Positions: SMH, IYW, SPMO",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is taking the market by storm, and it’s not just the stock that is benefiting. Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia’s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\n\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia’s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock’s percentage weight within the ETF.\n\nLet’s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\n1. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH)\n\nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors “exposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.”\n\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund’s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia’s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nSMH’s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\n\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nI’m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\n\n2. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to “track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.” IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\n\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW’s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH’s massive 25.7% position. Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of IYW’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ Holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nLike SMH, IYW’s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nWhile this ETF’s focus is different than SMH’s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they’ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\n\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nI’m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\n\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys, 27 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n3. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO)\n\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach. SPMO is “based on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,” which “tracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high ‘momentum score.’” The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\n\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO’s holdings, which is less than SMH’s exposure but more than IYW’s. In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPMO’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nSPMO isn’t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO’s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO’s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher. Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn’t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\n\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I’m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position.\n\nIs SPMO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nNo Shortage of Ways to Invest in Nvidia\n\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Adds Morgan Stanley's data)\n\nBy Nell Mackenzie and Carolina Mandl\n\nLONDON/NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Global hedge funds sold tech stocks at their highest pace in almost eight months in the week to Feb. 23, Goldman Sachs said, piling into bets against the sector just as Nvidia's latest earnings fuelled a surge in tech shares.\n\nThe tech share selling by hedge funds ranked among the highest seen in the last five years, according to the Goldman Sachs note released on Friday and seen by Reuters on Monday.\n\nIn a separate note, Morgan Stanley said tech was the most net sold sector last week.\n\nStock indexes, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have rallied to record highs on optimism about artificial intelligence. Chipmaker Nvidia added $277 billion in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history, after the company's quarterly report beat expectations.\n\nBut in a sign that sentiment may be turning, the number of hedge funds that now have short bets that tech stock prices will fall is twice versus those with long positions, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nHedge funds took short bets against stocks from tech companies across the sector. They exited long positions and added short punts on manufacturing and service equipment for the semiconductor industry, tech hardware, storage and IT services, the bank said.\n\nThe speculators added short bets to software companies, Goldman Sachs said, while Morgan Stanley said hedge funds bet against semiconductor and tech hardware companies.\n\nHowever, traders remained reluctant to completely sever their positive positions in tech, a separate note from Goldman Sachs said. That pointed to a two-year high in call options on Nvidia.\n\nThese are derivatives bets which only make the trader long if the stock passes a certain price threshold - a way to express a positive position in the stock but only if it rises to a certain extent.\n\nSpeculators were generally short U.S. stocks, piling into the largest net selling of the region's equity markets in five weeks, the first Goldman Sachs note said.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersistent price rises by U.S. service sector businesses have underscored the stickiness of inflation and pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024, denting hopes for a soft landing.\n\nTraders ditched tech, health care and industrial stocks and instead bought the largest amount consumer staples stocks in 10 weeks, adding companies which make products that people routinely buy, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nMorgan Stanley said hedge funds sold equities Monday through Wednesday, but changed their minds after the Thursday tech rally sparked by Nvidia and bought back all of what they previously sold, mainly in industrials, materials and financials.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie in London, and Carolina Mandl in New York; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe, Andrew Heavens and Leslie Adler)",

        "title": "The 3 Most Popular Stocks Owned by Congress in Q1",
        "content": "Sometimes, the best trading advice can come from a list of stocks owned by Congress. If they’re buying, you may want to look into it. Politicians seem to have an uncanny, remarkable track record of success.\n\nFor example, on Nov. 22, Rep. Nancy Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 20 Dec 2024 $120 call options even as the underlying stock traded at a high of $503.31. Today, NVDA stock trades around $784. Had you followed her into NVDA, you stood to make a good deal of money.\n\nGranted, not all of her trades worked out so well, but the exception proves the rule.  So if you find that a top official is buying something, you may want to do your due diligence and consider following them in. The only downfall to this strategy is that elected officials don’t have to disclose their transactions for 30 to 45 days under the STOCK Act. These three companies are some of the most popular stocks owned by Congress.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top stocks owned by Congress is Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that yields 5.2%.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Rep. Victoria Spartz bought 91,000 shares for around $138 — just as it was bottoming out around the time earnings were coming out. The trade was then disclosed on Feb. 16, as SPG traded at $146. A week later it was up to $151. So, even if you and I bought on the disclosure, we would still have walked away with a few dollars.\n\nAt the time, it was a good bet on potential interest rate cuts and the company’s announcement of a $2 billion stock buyback. However, with no interest rate cuts to be seen, and the buyback news priced in, I’d wait for SPG stock to put in a healthy pullback before even considering buying Simon Property Group here.\n\nWith earnings, the REIT is seeing improvements. In its fourth quarter, Simon saw funds from operations (FFO) of $3.69, which beat by 36 cents. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up about 9% year over year, and beat estimates by $160 million. Guidance was a bit underwhelming, though. For the full-year 2024, it now expects its FFO to come in between $11.85 and $12.10 per share, which is lower than expectations for a range of $12.20 to $12.51 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nApollo Medical Holdings (AMEH) Image of a hospital with workers walking in the halls\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe learned that Rep. Judy Chu bought just over $350,000 worth of Apollo Medical (NASDAQ:AMEH), as noted by CapitolTrades.com. The stock was purchased on Jan. 10 at $37.66. When the transaction was disclosed on Jan. 22, it traded at $37.65. Today, it closed at $42.79. If you bought on the disclosure, you could have made a nice little profit.\n\nAt its current price though, I’d wait for it to pull back. Right now, it’s overbought on various technical analysis indicators like relative strength, moving averages, and momentum. However, over the long term, it could be attractive. According to Bank of America – which upgraded it to a buy rating – there’s “an inflection point in the growth story, with a high confidence path to sustaining 30-40%+ revenue and 20%+ EBITDA growth through at least 2026,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nThe firm also points to a few key headwinds for AMEH, including organic contract wins, tuck-in mergers and acquisitions and a reduction in its corporate tax rate. Of special note is the end of Medicaid redeterminations, which is Apollo Medical’s largest customer segment.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top trade was the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG). We can see that on Nov. 3, Rep. Hal Rogers bought shares just under $270. That was then disclosed on Dec. 20. Then, on Jan. 19, Rep. Blake Moore bought shares at $319.98. He then disclosed that five days later on Jan. 24. Since then, the VUG ETF ran to $338.84.\n\nWhile it’s also a bit overbought at the moment, it could eventually see higher highs. Vanguard Growth has an expense ratio of just 0.04%. Like all of Vanguard’s family of funds, they tend to be the lowest in the business. The Vanguard Growth ETF tracks the nation’s largest growth stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to name a few of its 208 holdings.\n\nThese, of course, were some of the leading Magnificent Seven stocks last year and powered the market indexes to new highs. As some of these companies are roaring ahead out of the gate again in 2024, Vanguard Growth should prosper too, no matter which congressional representative is buying the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "SoundHoundAI(NASDAQ: SOUN) stock is posting explosive gains in Monday's trading. The company's share price was up 39.5% as of 2:40 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSoundHound AI is surging today thanks to an announcement that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has formed a new partnership with other influential hardware and software players to advance artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the telecommunications industry. Nvidia also announced that it was expanding its partnership with ServiceNow to advance telecom technologies.\n\nThe news could bode well for SoundHound's voice-based assistant business. The audio software specialist's stock is now up 180% across 2024's trading.\n\nAn AI telecom alliance has Wall Street feeling bullish\n\nAt the Mobile World Congress expo today, it was announced that Nvidia had entered into a new partnership with Arm Holdings, Microsoft, Amazon, Softbank, Samsung, Ericsson, and Nokia to advance radio-access-network (RAN) and AI technologies in the telecommunications industry. The AI-RAN Alliance has been formed with the goal of paving the way for dramatic improvements in artificial intelligence and communications technologies.\n\nThis morning, Nvidia's Senior Telecom Vice President Ronnie Vasishta said, \"The AI-RAN Alliance brings together industry-shaping companies with expertise from silicon through software to deliver on the promise of ubiquitous AI and 6G.\" Next-generation network technology could help power ongoing improvements for AI and bolster adoption of SoundHound's services.\n\nIn addition to the unveiling of the AI-RAN Alliance, Nvidia also announced today that it's deepening its partnership with ServiceNow. The two companies are rolling out generative-AI solutions that have been tailored for the telecom industry. While neither of Nvidia's partnership announcements specifically mentioned SoundHound AI, investors are betting that they could wind up creating bullish catalysts for the audio-technology specialist.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith holdings disclosures that were made public last week, Nvidia revealed that it owned a stake in SoundHound AI. At the time of Nvidia's filing, its SoundHound stock was worth roughly $3.7 million -- but the disclosure soon sent the audio-software company's share price skyrocketing.\n\nWhat comes next for SoundHound AI?\n\nSoundHound announced last week that its Iris voice-assistant technology would soon go into full production and launch with vehicles from Stellantis. SoundHound's voice assistant is integrated with OpenAI's ChatGPT technology and will be launching with Stellantis DS vehicles next month.\n\nWith new AI, RAN, and 6G technologies, the capabilities of SoundHound's personal assistant could be significantly improved. Additionally, it's possible that a wide range of new use cases could emerge. Voice-based operating systems have come into focus as a key interface for potential AI technologies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

There is a lot more data this week than last week but it's still not the biggest of the data.\"\n\nA strong forecast from chip designer Nvidia last week added to this year's artificial intelligence frenzy, helping to push the Dow and S&P to new highs and the Nasdaq just shy of its November 2021 record, while keeping disappointment over the Fed's delayed rate cut in check.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 19.28 points, or 0.39%, to end at 5,069.42 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 20.57 points, or 0.13%, to 15,976.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.23 points, or 0.16%, to 39,063.55.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe S&P 500 has gained for 15 of the past 17 weeks - something which has only happened only once in the last 50 years, in 1989, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\nHelping to lift the Nasdaq was a gain in Micron Technology as it started mass production of its high-bandwidth memory semiconductors for use in Nvidia's latest AI chip.\n\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index gained more than 1%. Google-parent Alphabet stumbled after announcing plans to relaunch its AI tool in the next few weeks. It was paused last week after inaccuracies in some historical depictions.\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway dipped, erasing early gains on investor worries after the U.S. government warned of a lawsuit against its power company, PacifiCorp.\n\nDomino's Pizza jumped after surpassing Wall Street expectations for quarterly same-store sales.\n\nIntuitive Machines plunged after the company said its spacecraft had tipped over shortly after touching down on the lunar surface.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)",

        "content": "By Nell Mackenzie\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Global hedge funds sold tech stocks at their highest pace in almost eight months in the week to Feb. 23, Goldman Sachs said, piling into bets against the sector just as Nvidia's latest earnings fuelled a surge in tech shares.\n\nThe tech share selling by hedge funds ranked among the highest seen in the last five years, according to the Goldman Sachs note released on Friday and seen by Reuters on Monday.\n\nStock indices, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have rallied to record highs on optimism about artificial intelligence. Chipmaker Nvidia added $277 billion in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history, after its quarterly report beat expectations.\n\nBut in a sign that sentiment may be turning, twice the number of hedge funds now have short bets that tech stock prices will fall versus those with long positions, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nHedge funds took out short bets against stocks from tech companies across the sector. They exited long positions and added short punts on manufacturing and service equipment for the semiconductor industry, tech hardware, storage and IT services, the bank said.\n\nThe speculators added short bets to software companies, it added.\n\nHowever, traders remained reluctant to completely sever their positive positions in tech, a separate note from Goldman Sachs said. That pointed to a two-year high in call options on Nvidia.\n\nThese are derivatives bets which only make the trader long if the stock passes a certain price threshold - a way to express a positive position in the stock but only if it rises to a certain extent.\n\nSpeculators were generally short U.S. stocks, piling into the largest net selling of the region's equity markets in five weeks, the first Goldman Sachs note said.\n\nPersistent price rises by U.S. service sector businesses have underscored the stickiness of inflation and pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024, denting hopes for a soft landing.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders ditched tech, health care and industrial stocks and instead bought the largest amount consumer staples stocks in ten weeks, adding companies which make products that people routinely buy, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThese included stocks from companies linked to distribution, retail, beverages and household products, but not tobacco, it added.\n\nRegulators worldwide have increased scrutiny on E-cigarettes, possibly spelling trouble for some big tobacco companies that make them.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in December 2023, urged governments to treat e-cigarettes similarly to tobacco and ban all flavours.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Andrew Heavens)",

        "title": "The way to make money is to ignore the crowd – so forget Nvidia and buy this miner",
        "content": "anglo american\n\nAs Nvidia gallops relentlessly higher, and momentum investing in technology and particularly in AI-related stocks feels like the only game in town, this writer is left to ponder whether the experience offered by 30-odd years in the financial markets is worth a bean.\n\nThis is particularly the case now, when a process-driven preference for contrarian, value-oriented picks has led to trouble at Close Brothers, Springfield Properties and Smith & Nephew, to name but three.\n\nYet this approach has also unearthed winners such as Hunting, Beazley and a good few takeover targets too, and the subject of unearthing takes us to our next unloved object of attention, Anglo American.\n\nOn the face of it, the giant miner’s full-year results for 2023, released last week, offered little to recommend them: profits down, a dividend cut and weak free cash flow, with a rise in net debt on top.\n\nDecember’s cuts to the 2023 production outlook had at least got a lot of the bad news out early, but chief executive Duncan Wanblad and his team have continued to attract brickbats for not doing enough to simplify the group’s structure, sell assets and cut costs and debt, not least because the share price has fallen by about 60pc since Wanblad took the helm in spring 2022.\n\nThere is nothing that management could have done to stop platinum or diamond prices from plunging, thanks to concerns over the move away from the internal combustion engine and the rise of lab-grown alternatives to mined gemstones respectively, while Wanblad and his team inherited the Woodsmith potash project in North Yorkshire. That became part of the portfolio when Anglo bought Sirius Minerals for £405m in 2020 and the deal has left the FTSE 100 miner with a big capital investment bill.\n\nNor should investors forget that mining is a cyclical, boom-and-bust business, related to both momentum in the global economy and capital investment trends: high mineral prices (and profits) attract more investment, which generates more supply, which eventually exceeds demand and drives down prices. That leads to a collapse in profits, cuts in capital expenditure and retrenchment in supply to the point where demand catches up, prices start to rise and the cycle starts again.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnless investors are convinced it will be “different this time” – and Anglo American is still a major, and profitable, producer of copper and iron ore, as well as steelmaking coal – it may be worth pondering how close we are to any cyclical bottom right now.\n\nYes, Britain, Germany and Japan are in recession, but itchy-fingered central bankers are likely to push the button on interest rate cuts, or even more quantitative easing if they have to, rather than face a deep downturn that would do untold damage to heavily indebted economies.\n\nAnd with Bidenomics in full swing, America is applying plenty of fiscal stimulus to its economy; it seems unlikely that a Trump presidency would press for a return to hair-shirt austerity.\n\nEditorial Tools Comparison chart Article Chart Index Widget Ticker Bar Select instruments AAL Anglo American PLC Share (AAL) VAALCO Energy Inc Share (EGY) Selected: Anglo American PLC X Select time period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Anglo American PLC FROM 27 Feb '19 February February 2019 2019 Previous MonthNext Month Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 TO 26 Feb February February 2024 2024 Previous MonthNext Month Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Additional chart options Anglo American share price Script\n\nAll of that may mean inflation is not quite as tame as it may seem and, should it remain higher for longer than expected, history suggests “real” assets (ones that cannot be printed) may be more highly prized than assets than can be printed by central banks (cash) or issued like confetti by governments (bonds).\n\nEither way, sentiment feels washed out on miners and Anglo American in particular (with the mad dash towards Nvidia and AI stocks playing its role).\n\nBroadly, the Bloomberg Commodity index stands at 0.94 times the value of the FTSE All-World index. This compares with a peak of 2.5 times in 2012, when commodity stocks and miners were king of the hill, and a low of 0.5 in 1999 when the tech bubble was nearing its zenith. The post-1994 average is 1.2 times.\n\nMore narrowly, Anglo American’s shares trade no higher than in 2005. As a result, the company has a market value of £23.1bn ($29.3bn), which compares with net assets (excluding $1.5bn of intangibles) of $30.1bn. So anyone who buys now is doing so at less than book value.\n\nGranted, the miner has just taken a $2.6bn asset writedown so nothing is set in stone, but this lowly valuation may give us some protection, while $1bn of cost and $1.6bn in capital expenditure cuts over the next three years may be the first steps to self-help.\n\nTime to wave the flag for Anglo American.\n\nQuestor says: buy\n\nTicker: AAL\n\nShare price at close: £17.27\n\nRuss Mould is investment director at AJ Bell, the stockbroker.

        "title": "7 High-Upside Tech Stocks to Buy That Also Pay Dividends",
        "content": "Generally speaking, investors buy tech stocks for their exposure to growth and not dividends. When the tech sector gets hot, it grows very quickly producing rapid returns. 2023 was a prime example of that broad truth. Investors will continue to buy tech stocks primarily for that exposure.\n\nYet, text stocks also provide the stability of dividend income in some cases. Most tech firms direct cash toward growth prospects primarily. More established firms also choose to direct the sum of their cash back to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThose are the firms we will be discussing below. These firms tend to pay lower yields but there are also cases in which yields exceed 3% or more. Let’s take a look at these tech firms and their dividends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who do their homework on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will discover that it actually pays a dividend. In fact, the company instituted its dividend program all the way back in 2013. Nvidia has never reduced its dividend payment during that time.\n\nWhile its yield is very low at 0.02%, it is clearly very reliable overall. To be clear, Nvidia is not highly focused on its dividend program as an enticement to investors: the dividend has only grown by 2% on average over the past five years.\n\nIn any case, investors are interested in Nvidia for its growth prospects. The small dividend is something of a novelty but provides a slight amount of income nonetheless. Investors will buy NVDA shares at the moment primarily because it continues to shine. Its fourth quarter earnings beat was yet another strong signal from the world’s leading chip maker. Buy Nvidia because it has the potential to move as high as $1,300 but also consider that dividend which will continue to grow over time.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Is one of the better known tech dividend stocks. The internet networking firm pays a dividend yielding more than 3% and which has not been reduced for more than a dozen years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat dividend looks to add an additional $1.60 to each share of CSCO stock in 2024. Consider that in light of the fact that analysts believe share prices could rise above $76 this year. That would put the total return at $78. Cisco Systems shares currently trade for approximately $49. There is legitimate potential for investors and that dividend yield is critical.\n\nEven if those share prices don’t rise that high, the consensus is that they will rise above $57. In that case, the $1.60 in dividends becomes even more attractive.\n\nOne of the primary reasons Wall Street is bullish on Cisco Systems is the simple fact that IP protocol demand should continue to rise in light of the continued emergence of AI. By the shares for their exposure to that potential growth and rest easy knowing that they provide income.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is no doubt that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a high upside investment. Despite its meteoric growth over the past year there is likely more ahead. In fact, analysts believe it could rise as high as $600 this year. That would represent roughly 50% growth above its current price.\n\nThat potential is pushed marginally higher by Microsoft’s dividend which yields 0.75%. Microsoft pays $3 in annual dividends. In total, MSFT shares could rise as high as $603. The other thing to note is that Microsoft’s dividend is rock solid. The company has never reduced the dividend for the entirety of its existence. That’s probably not much of a surprise to readers: Microsoft is a cash rich firm that instituted the dividend as a bonus in reality. The likelihood that Microsoft reduces the payout is effectively zero.\n\nThe argument in favor of investing in Microsoft as a dividend stock is largely the same as that for the other tech giants with dividends: buy them for the growth potential and consider the dividend as a nice to have novelty.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) provides semiconductor products to firms around the world. Its stock is highly regarded and widely expected to grow from its current price of $103. The consensus opinion is that those shares will rise in value to $115 and potentially move as high as $140.\n\nThe company’s dividend adds an additional $2.72 to its potential returns. Should Skyworks Solutions shares reach the consensus price of $115, that equates to a difference between 11.65% returns and 14.3%. Investors can easily understand the value of a higher yield dividend such as that which Skyworks Solutions provides. The 2.63% yield may not sound particularly impressive but the figures show that it makes a large difference overall.\n\nThe company last reduced that dividend in 2014. However, the semi-annual dividend has been in existence since 1980. Higher yield dividends require more cash and are thus more likely to be reduced in leaner times. That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment and Skyworks Solutions continues to be an excellent choice among tech dividend stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is another of the leading tech firms that also pays a dividend. In fact, among the best known Silicon Valley firms, only Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) lacks a dividend entirely.\n\nUntil recently, Meta Platforms was similar to Google and did not pay any dividend. That changed on February 1st when the company reported 4th quarter earnings and initiated its first ever dividend of 50 cents.\n\nThe decision coincided with the company’s 20th anniversary. It also followed after the company beat 4th quarter expectations on Wall Street. Advertising revenues have rebounded as the unexpectedly strong economy continues to hum along.\n\nWhile the move was welcomed by Wall Street, it is also curious given the fact that META needs all the cash it can get at the moment. The company is trying to satisfy the dual beasts of AI growth and its continued losses in its metaverse segment. Again, it is welcome none-the-less and makes META shares currently among dividend paying tech firms worth investing in.\n\nAAPL (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWould you believe that AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been paying a dividend since 1987? It has, but there was a long pause during that period in which it paid no dividends at all. The company paused its dividend payment between late 1995 and the summer of 2012. That was the last time that the company reduced its dividend payment which currently yields 0.5%.\n\nThe decision heralded the beginning of a new era as Apple transitioned from the leadership of Steve Jobs into that of Tim Cook. The rationale for the reintroduction of the dividend was that it would attract liquidity in the form of institutional investment thus increasing share prices. The history of Apple’s share growth over the past decade makes it difficult to argue against the decision. AAPL shares have returned more than 27% on average annually over the past decade. That was enough to 11x an investment made at the beginning of that period.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but certainly not least on this list of dividend tech stocks is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The company provides investors with $3.20 annually in dividends per share owned. That equates to a yield of more than 2% which is relatively high in the tech world. The general thinking is that that cash would be better served pursuing growth prospects and thus yields of say 5%, for example, are exceedingly rare.\n\nIt’s fair to characterize Qualcomm’s dividend as being stable and relatively quickly growing. It was last reduced in 2003 and has grown at an annual rate of 5.3% over the last five years.\n\nWhile those points of attraction are logical reasons to buy Qualcomm, there are others to consider. Qualcomm is well diversified and exposed to current growth trends. It is one of the better positioned tech firms in relation to the confluence of AI and phones. The company has released updated AI features on its flagship phones. Investors remain very curious to see how the application of advanced AI to phones will drive revenues.  Smartphone revenues have been extraordinarily high as the world remains glued to their handsets. Qualcomm is a major provider to Apple which is a major catalyst to consider overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Future Juggernauts: The Next 7 Trillion Dollar Companies to Buy Now",
        "content": "Investors learned an important lesson in 2023: investing in the biggest companies and their stocks is a surefire way to capture strong gains. The Magnificent 7 – all of which are trillion dollar stocks – produced strong returns for investors.\n\nTherefore, it’s easy to see why investors continue to look for the next trillion dollar companies to buy now.  These companies promise to provide similar returns for investors. The names discussed below populate the ranks between the 8th and 18th most valuable firms.\n\nIf you have reached the trillion dollar threshold in the past but have since fallen back below that level. The others are in a strong position to pass that level in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s take a look at these juggernaut companies in order to understand why investors should buy now.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nWall Street continues to ask whether Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock has the ability to reach  a valuation of $1 trillion. Morgan Stanley is among the firms that  remain bullish in answering that question.\n\nAnalysts there recently raised their target price from $805 to $945. Should LLY shares reach $945 that still would put its valuation short of $1 trillion. Prices would have to reach just above $1,050 in order for Eli Lilly to become the first pharmaceutical stock valued at that level.\n\nThe obvious question then becomes why should investors believe that will be the case? The obvious answer is that Eli Lilly is at the forefront of a new era of drug making.\n\nThere is a huge market for FDA approved weight loss therapeutics. Eli Lilly has a winner in Zepbound. It received FDA approval for weight loss in November. Demand for the drug –  which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro –  is sky high. Mounjaro did more than $5 billion in sales in 2023 with an FDA indication for treating diabetes. Patients were demanding the drug for its ability to induce weight loss so when the FDA approved Zepbound for that indication Eli Lilly’s prospects brightened further. Sales reached $176 million in the fourth quarter, its first with FDA approval. analysts believe sales will be particularly strong given that Zepbound is indicated to reduce heart disease risks as well. That should make it easier for the drug to receive insurance approval.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is already a juggernaut by most standards. The stock is associated with Warren Buffett, arguably the most famous investor ever. Yet, at the same time, it has not reached the level of the Magnificent 7, all of which are valued at more than $1 trillion.\n\nHowever, when investors take a look at its history it is very clear to see that it is on a trajectory to pass that level in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett’s firm is well known for its strategy of investing in Blue Chip American companies.  The core of the company’s portfolio still consists of plays such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) primarily. Yet, a shift has emerged. The company is now investing more heavily in growth plays and lesser known names. That means it is increasingly invested in companies like Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) that poise the company for more growth.\n\nThe company is also highly invested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which makes up more than 50% of its overall holdings.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s fair to assert that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the best chance among the stocks listed in this article of reaching $1 trillion first. The company has been a trillion dollar firm in the past but current troubles plaguing the EV industry have slashed its valuation well below that level at present.\n\nAnalysts have pinpointed the reason for the decline to earnings projections. Wall Street continues to lower its earnings expectations for Tesla throughout 2024. The percentage by which their estimates have fallen correlates highly to the percentage by which Tesla’s shares have fallen over that time frame.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to argue with the numbers and the logic, I think there is something even simpler at play: Tesla doesn’t necessarily need Wall Street to come out and say that it has suddenly become positive about earnings for the shares to rebound.\n\nInstead, the company simply needs Elon Musk to show signs of his dedication to Tesla above all else. Should he do that and focus less on AI robots or X that might be just the spark that shares need.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA big part of the reason to believe in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock is its bullish expectations for the year. The company is already on record announcing that it expects 2024 to be a big year for growth, and a big reason to believe in that growth is the continued growth of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe leading AI chip firm again bested expectations with its 4th quarter earnings report. Both earnings and revenue figures were well above levels that Wall Street had been expecting. Yet, as promising as that sounds, it raises a question: can Nvidia continue to keep up with demand for its high priced processors that are strongly preferred for all things artificial intelligence?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has even further to grow in 2024. Nvidia relies on TSMC for chip production and packaging. So, it is an integral part of Nvidia’s ability to quiet critics who believe that it may not be able to keep up with demand in 2024. Bullish investors should ignore the noise and buy TSM stock as a direct indication of their confidence in both the firm and Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has doubled in the past 12 months. That puts it more than halfway on the path to a $1 trillion valuation. It clearly has a way to go before it can legitimately be considered a real threat to reach that level.\n\nWhile it will take time for Broadcom to realistically reach a $1 trillion valuation, it is worth investing in at the moment. For one, the company recently became more deeply entwined in the artificial intelligence race. CEO Hock Tan was recently added to the board of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe move deepens the already strong relationship between Meta and Broadcom. Meta is attempting to distance itself from Nvidia as a supplier and strengthen its collaborative efforts with firms like Broadcom in order to reduce costs. That should increase Broadcom’s sales from Meta in the future. Meta spent $500 million on service revenues with Broadcom last year.\n\nSo, while Broadcom has a long road ahead to reach $1 trillion, its relationship with Meta promises to speed up that trajectory.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the other pharmaceutical industry firm contending for its place as the first trillion dollar drug maker stock. It is very similar to Eli Lilly in both that regard and its drug portfolio.\n\nBoth firms have now FDA approved weight loss drugs that first received FDA approval as diabetes drugs. Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug is branded under the trade name Wegovy. The weight loss drug is given as an injection but the company also plans to sell it in pill form.\n\nThat should spike sales as the option of an orally taken pill is much more palatable than an injection. However, this is both a problem and an opportunity for Novo Nordisk. The company needs to increase manufacturing in order to meet the potential demand. The oral version of the drug requires more of the active ingredient than does the injectable form. Novo Nordisk will need to address its ability to manufacture the active ingredient at greater volumes in order to take advantage of the huge opportunity before it.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $11 billion for three factories in connection with its acquisition of Catalent. That news alone should give bulls all the confidence they need that Novo Nordisk can meet manufacturing demand for its drug.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who believe the oft repeated refrain that the rich are getting richer should consider buying LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) stock. In fact, it’s very easy to find sources to substantiate that opinion. This article and this one both suggest that the rich are indeed getting richer.\n\nAs people get richer they tend to buy greater volumes of the luxury goods that LVMH sells. The company, which is the largest luxury group globally, reported sales of 86.2 billion euros in 2023. That represented growth of 13% top line for the company and was a record year for the firm.\n\nLVMH is currently valued at approximately $450 billion. It has a long road ahead of to reach $1 trillion. Regardless, the company also has an incredibly diverse portfolio of luxury products and brands overall. Whether it’s jewelry, fashion, watches, expensive alcohol, or upscale retail shops, LVMH owns assets in those areas. That broad exposure to the world’s top luxury brands gives the company a scale that will allow it to continue to grow and head toward $1 trillion in valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors' fervor for all things AI-related is leaving its mark on the U.S. options market, as traders pile in to derivatives bets to gain exposure to the red-hot investing theme.\n\nOptions on artificial-intelligence darling Nvidia accounted for 25 cents of every dollar of premium - the price of contracts - traded in U.S. single-stock options over the past month, nearly $3 billion in options premium traded in the chipmaker's options every day on average, a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data showed. During several recent sessions, Nvidia surpassed Tesla as the option market’s most heavily traded name for the day.\n\nNvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday - two days after it released quarterly earnings - riding on insatiable demand for its chips which feature prominently in the generative AI craze.\n\nNvidia recently became the third-largest U.S.-listed company as measured in market capitalization. Its shares command a weighting of 4.5% in the S&P 500, giving them an outsized influence on the broader index's moves.\n\nNvidia's options should remain popular with traders, \"both from a hype and mechanical index perspective,\" said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. \"It represents such a large portion of S&P 500 weighting.\"\n\nThe stock's options have drawn a range of bets, including ones guarding against a drop in the stock toward $350 by March and others that would bear fruit if the stock extended its meteoric rise toward $900 and higher in coming months.\n\nNvidia shares were up 1.4% at $798.90 on Monday afternoon.\n\nA host of other AI names has also drawn heavy options volume, including Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings. Nvidia’s shares are up about 60% year-to-date, while those of Super Micro Computer have risen 200% and Arm’s have gained 77%. Nvidia is not the first company to captivate options players. Derivatives bets on electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla accounted for around half of all equity, index and ETF options premium in October 2021, as the company’s shares soared. Tesla’s options remain a crowd-puller that still often feature on the list of any given day's most actively traded options.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough the frantic pace of trading in Nvidia’s options could ease now that its earnings report is in the rearview mirror, market participants said the AI theme was likely to remain popular among investors.\n\nSome of the future demand for Nvidia's options is likely to come from investors who may have missed the wild rally in the stock. \"There are undoubtedly institutions that may not want to chase an already highly appreciated stock but don’t want to miss out on the rally,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Buying options would \"allow them to get leveraged exposure to Nvidia's upside but with a defined cash outlay,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Biden wants the US to make 20% of all high-end chips by end of the decade",
        "content": "The Biden administration laid out an ambitious new goal for the US: produce 20% of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips by the end of the decade.\n\nAchieving that mark — set by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a speech Monday morning — would be a dramatic turnabout for the US.\n\nIt currently makes 0% of the so-called \"leading edge logic\" chips that are considerably more powerful than older-generation semiconductors, making them crucial for everything from mobile phones to AI to quantum computing.\n\n\"That's a big number, yes,\" Raimondo said of the 20% goal while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe Biden administration hopes to help the country hit that ambitious mark with investments set aside by an 18-month-old law called the CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nThe legislation allows the White House to spend $50 billion in taxpayer dollars — $39 billion specifically earmarked for manufacturing — to try and help reignite American manufacturing in the years ahead.\n\nRaimondo overseeing the funds and says she will focus on helping projects that will be online this decade, a challenge for some of these incredibly complex efforts that require specialized equipment and supply chains. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in California. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) (Kent Nishimura via Getty Images)\n\nNot all companies may be happy with what they receive. The 2030 goal means many proposals with a longer timeline will not receive a grant, Raimondo said. Others may receive less than half of what they asked for because of limited funds.\n\n\"These are tough negotiations, that's our job,\" she said.\n\nRaimondo oversees a team of more than 200 people charged with implementing the legislation that was designed to confront America's falling share of semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAmerica produced nearly 40% of the world's chips in 1990, but less than 10% are made in the US today, according to the White House.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors: 100% of those are currently manufactured overseas, mostly in Taiwan.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus far, three smaller manufacturing awards have been rolled out to BAE Systems (BAESY), Microchip Technology, and GlobalFoundries (GFS).\n\nBut the vast majority of the work on building those leading edge chips will fall to giant players who are still waiting for their awards to be finalized. Intel (INTC), which is building a new factory in Ohio, reportedly in talks for as much as $10 billion of that government money.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is another likely recipient, and Raimondo signaled Monday that they could be in line for help.\n\nShe called a proposed project by the company in Arizona \"pathbreaking\" and lauded them for investing in the US and promised \"we're going to make sure it's successful.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best S&P 500 dividend stocks to invest in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500's performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.\n\nDespite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors. Over an extended period, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which monitors the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has surpassed the S&P 500 index while exhibiting lower volatility, indicating higher risk-adjusted returns. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats' ability to mitigate losses can be observed through its upside and downside capture ratios. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has outperformed the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time from December 29, 1989, to July 31, 2023. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the benchmark index.\n\nConsidering these points, let's explore some of the top S&P 500 dividend-paying stocks. 14 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo create this list, we first examined the S&P 500 stocks based on their weight in the index and picked the top 25 stocks that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders.

Nvidia rose 1.2% after hitting $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday. Tesla outperformed peers, rising 4.0%.\n\nAlso propping up the Nasdaq was a 5.8% gain in Micron Technology as it started mass production of its high-bandwidth memory semiconductors for use in Nvidia's latest AI chip. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.1%. Google-parent Alphabet dropped 3.7% after announcing plans to relaunch its AI tool in the next few weeks. It was paused last week after inaccuracies in some historical depictions. Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway shed 1.2%, erasing early gains on investor worries after the U.S. government warned of a lawsuit against its power company, PacifiCorp.\n\nDomino's Pizza jumped 6.1% on surpassing Wall Street expectations for quarterly same-store sales.\n\nIntuitive Machines slumped 32.0% after the company said its spacecraft had tipped over shortly after touching down on the lunar surface.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 57 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 97 new highs and 58 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "Momentum ETFs Hit New 52-Week Highs",
        "content": "Wall Street has been on a remarkable rally powered by strong corporate earnings, AI developments and renewed confidence in the tech sector. The latest phase of the rally is driven by Nvidia’s NVDA blockbuster earnings, which pushed the major indexes to key milestones last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones reached a new record high while the S&P 500 broke above 5,100 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index also touched a new 52-week high.\r\n\r\nThe rally has been broad-based this year, with momentum investing emerging as a big winner. While there are several options in this space, we have highlighted five ETFs that hit new highs in the latest trading session. These include Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF SPMO, iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, Qraft AI-Enhanced U.S. Large Cap Momentum ETF AMOM, SPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF MMTM and JPMorgan U.S. Momentum Factor ETF JMOM. These ETFs seek higher returns in a short spell and will continue their outperformance if the same trends prevail.\n\nNvidia’s Surge\n\nThis leading U.S. chip maker surpassed $2 trillion in market capitalization following its robust results. It exceeded fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The company reported a staggering 265% increase in revenues and provided an optimistic outlook, indicating a surge in demand for AI hardware. This not only showcased Nvidia's robust position in the AI chip market but also signaled promising prospects for the semiconductor industry in 2025 and beyond (read: Nvidia Drives AI and Semiconductor Stocks: ETFs to Gain).\r\n\r\nNvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services.\n\nWhy Momentum?\n\nMomentum investing aims to capitalize on the continuance of an existing market trend. It involves the purchase of assets that have been showing an upward trend in price or selling short assets that have been showing a downward trend, with the expectation that the trend will continue. As such, investors can potentially achieve high returns by buying stocks in an uptrend and selling them when they show signs of reversing.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of momentum as a factor in stock selection. Momentum strategies have historically performed well across different markets and time periods, although past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nInvesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO) – Up 16.7%\r\n\r\nInvesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF tracks the S&P 500 Momentum Index, which measures the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 index that have a high \"momentum score.” It holds 101 securities in its basket and charges 13 bps in fees per year. Information technology is the top sector with a 26.1% share, while healthcare, industrials and communication services round off the next three with double-digit exposure each. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF has AUM of $610.1 million.\r\n\r\niShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) – Up 15%\r\n\r\niShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF follows the MSCI USA Momentum SR Variant Index, holding 123 stocks and exhibiting a relatively higher price momentum. It is skewed toward the information sector at 41.6%, while communication, industrials, and consumer discretionary round off the next spots with double-digit exposure each. iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF has accumulated $9.7 billion in its asset base and charges 15 bps in fees per year (read: 5 ETFs at All-Time Highs as S&P 500 Rally Continues).\r\n\r\nQraft AI-Enhanced U.S. Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) – Up 13.6%\r\n\r\nQraft AI-Enhanced U.S. Large Cap Momentum ETF is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks capital appreciation by investing in stocks that exhibit higher price momentum. It holds 50 stocks in its basket. Technology is the top sector with a 48.6% allocation, followed by healthcare, consumer cyclical and industrials. Qraft AI-Enhanced U.S. Large Cap Momentum ETF has accumulated $15.5 million in its asset base and charges 75 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF (MMTM) – Up 10.1%\r\n\r\nSPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF offers exposure to the stocks exhibiting the strongest momentum characteristics by tracking the S&P 1500 Positive Momentum Tilt Index. It holds 1,462 stocks in its basket, with key holdings in information technology, consumer discretionary and communication services. SPDR S&P 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF has amassed $92.8 million in its asset base and charges 12 bps in annual fees from investors (read: 5 Sector ETFs Beating the Market Halfway Through Q1).\r\n\r\nJPMorgan U.S. Momentum Factor ETF (JMOM) – Up 9.9%\r\n\r\nJPMorgan U.S. Momentum Factor ETF is designed to provide equity exposure with a focus on companies with strong risk-adjusted momentum and the potential to enhance returns. It follows the JP Morgan US Momentum Factor Index and holds 302 stocks in its basket. Technology is the top sector at 33%, while consumer discretionary, industrials, healthcare, and financials round off the next spots with double-digit exposure each.

        "content": "In hindsight, financial bubbles seem obvious. For investors looking to find parallels between today's stock market and other points in history, some have made concerning comparisons to the dot-com bubble, in which the Nasdaq Stock Market fell by 75% in just over 2½ years.\n\nEven J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) strategists have flagged some similarities to the era. A recent note by analyst Khuram Chaudhry said, \"Parallels to the ‘Dotcom Bubble' era are often dismissed due to the ‘irrational exuberance' that characterized this period. In this note, we demonstrate that there are a plethora of similarities between these two periods.\"\n\nAt the time, valuations were extreme but justified by the market given a then-expected surge in future demand caused by the internet boom.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nNew in startups – Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series. Did you know StartEngine Private is your portal to investing in venture-backed businesses without spending millions?\n\nSun Microsystems Inc. was a poster child of the dot-com era, reaching as high as $250 per share only to fall back to $10 per share near the end of 2002.\n\nSun Co-Founder and CEO Scott McNealy told Bloomberg around that time that it was obvious his company was ridiculously overvalued.\n\n\"Two years ago, we were selling at 10 times revenues when we were at $64. At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends,\" he said. \"That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D [research and development] for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\n\n\"Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don't need any transparency. You don't need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\"\n\nMcNealy explained how challenging it is to live up to lofty market expectations, especially when a high price to sales is used by analysts to value stock prices.\n\nThe price-to-sales metric continues to be used and explains how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of a company's sales.\n\nWhile McNealy explains why a 10 times price-to-sales is high, investors have had no problem bidding up Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock price, giving them a 32.27 price-to-sales ratio.\n\nInvestors scared off by a lofty price-to-sales metric would have missed out on a massive gain in Nvidia's stock, which is up around 235% in the past year and close to 2,000% over the past five years, even though its price-to-sales has been higher in the past than it is today.\n\nIn July 2023, for example, its price-to-sales ratio was as high as 45.8 and even ended 2021 over 30, well before the artificial intelligence (AI) boom started.\n\nThis goes to show that companies can live up to their high expectations but are required to maintain and increase their incredibly fast growth just to keep their stock prices at today's levels and allow for future appreciation.\n\nAny companies looking to compete with Nvidia will be working to eat into their margins and gain market share, meaning investors buying and holding Nvidia today better hope they can maintain their dominant position for years to come.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.

        "title": "Option Income Strategy ETFs That Gained Last Week",
        "content": "The option income strategy gained momentum last week. YieldMax SQ Option Income Strategy ETF SQY, YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF NVDY and YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF MRNY were up in double digits.\r\n\r\nThis strategy aims to generate regular income from options like selling covered calls, which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date.\r\n\r\nIf the stocks rise above a specified “strike” price, the fund pays the buyer of the option the difference between the stock price and the strike price. However, if the stock declines or simply stays below the exercise price, the fund keeps the income paid by the option buyer. That premium is passed on to fund holders, which is a big attraction for many investors (read: 5 Technology Stocks Powering the S&P 500 ETF This Year).\r\n\r\nWith this process, the ETF portfolio aims to generate additional monthly income from the call option (premiums collected). The income from option premiums can help to offset losses from the underlying stocks, which can potentially result in lower portfolio volatility. This means that option income strategies might experience smaller price swings compared to a pure equity investment.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback is that selling covered calls caps the gains of the ETF. During bullish markets, the ETFs might underperform as the profits from rising stock prices are partially offset by the losses on the call options. As such, the strategy outperforms in neutral to bear markets but underperforms in bull markets in the short term. Additionally, the fees associated with the management of the covered call strategy, along with the ETF’s expense ratio, could erode the fund's returns, especially if the strategy fails to generate the expected income.\r\n\r\nAn option income strategy is particularly attractive to income-focused investors, including retirees or those nearing retirement, who are looking for ways to enhance yield in their portfolios without taking on excessive risk.\r\n\r\nWe have provided details of the above-mentioned ETFs here:\r\n\r\nYieldMax SQ Option Income Strategy ETF (SQY) – Up 14.9%\r\n\r\nYieldMax SQ Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on Block, formerly known as Square SQ. It pursues a strategy that aims to harvest compelling yields while retaining capped participation in the price gains of SQ. YieldMax SQ Option Income Strategy ETF has accumulated $33.4 million in its asset base and charges 99 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nYieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY) – Up 11.3%\r\n\r\nYieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on Nvidia NVDA. NVDY pursues a strategy that aims to harvest compelling yields while retaining capped participation in the price gains of NVDA. YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF has amassed $185.3 million in its asset base while trading in an average daily volume of 185,0000 shares. It charges 99 bps in annual fees per year from investors (read: Nvidia ETFs to Tap for More Growth Post Blowout Q4 Earnings).\r\n\r\nYieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF (MRNY) – Up 10%\r\n\r\nYieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate monthly income by selling/writing call options on Moderna (MRNA).

        "title": "Up 63% in 2024, Where Will Nvidia's Soaring Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "With shares up a whopping 63% year to date, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is still riding high on the artificial intelligence (AI) wave that boosted its shares by almost 240% in the last 12 months alone.\n\nStellar fourth-quarter results confirm that the company still enjoys significant near-term momentum. But what could the next five years have in store? Let's explore how new business verticals and valuation concerns could shape this iconic chipmaker's long-term trajectory.\n\nIncredible fourth-quarter earnings\n\nNvidia's earnings have become big events for tech investors. Because of the chipmaker's outsized role in the burgeoning AI industry, its operational results can give valuable clues about the state of the sector as a whole. This time, the company didn't disappoint.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% year over year to $22.1 billion (up 22% sequentially) based on sales of its industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) for training and running AI applications.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Nvidia's gross margin of 76% (up 12% year over year) remains spectacularly high for a hardware company. The margins suggest the chipmaker still enjoys significant pricing power despite rising competition from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, which recently entered the market with its new MI300 family of AI chips.\n\nNew business verticals can power continued growth\n\nThe AI chip industry may still be in its early stages, with some experts expecting it to be worth $400 billion by 2027. That said, Nvidia may need to diversify its strategy in this market. Over time, some of its largest data center customers may invest more in making proprietary chips instead of relying on its expensive third-party supplies. Management is taking several steps to get ahead of this potential challenge.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn February, Nvidia announced a $30 billion investment into a new business unit focused on helping cloud computing clients make customized chips. This move could help Nvidia leverage its economies of scale to tackle the market for niche use cases that aren't well served by its general-purpose chips like the H100 and A100.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also betting on the software through its supercomputer DGX Cloud, designed to help clients create and run AI applications without going through the trouble of building their own infrastructure. Together, these diversification efforts can help the company maintain its extremely high growth rate in the face of rising competition.\n\nIs the stock still affordable?\n\nNvidia is arguably one of the most compelling companies in the world from an investor standpoint. It has a rock-solid economic moat in a high-margin opportunity. And it is future-proofing its business by expanding into synergistic opportunities in custom chips and software. Most surprisingly, shares still trade at a reasonable valuation of just 33 times forward earnings -- slightly higher than the S&P 500 average of 28.\n\nNvidia's only serious risk seems to be if the AI industry fails to meet its lofty expectations. But there are no signs of that happening yet. Investors who purchased shares near the lows in 2023 may want to take some profits off the table. But the stock still looks like a long-term buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 26, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Coca-Cola Company KO, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) a Must-Buy After AI-Fueled Blowout Earnings\n\nNvidia Corporation ignited a record-setting rally in the stock market on Feb 22 after the chipmaker posted blockbuster fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on the strength of a spending hysteria on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia's bumper profits and revenues helped the chipmaker register a record one-day gain in market capitalization for any company in the United States. Nvidia added $277 billion in market capitalization in the last trading session.\n\nThis California-based company's one-day gain in stock market value easily surpassed the one-day gain of $204.5 billion by Meta Platforms, Inc. on Feb 2 after the social media giant reported robust quarterly results and declared its first dividend. In reality, Nvidia's one-day gain eclipsed the entire value of the Coca-Cola Company at $263.7 billion.\n\nNvidia has now regained its position as the third most valuable company in the U.S. stock market, lagging only behind Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc.. Nvidia's shares have now soared 59.5% so far this year, way more than the broader S&P 500's rise of 4.3%.\n\nNvidia registered the best one-day percentage gain of 16.4% yesterday since it rallied 24.4% on May 23, 2023. Nvidia's stock has now touched an all-time high of $785.38. (read more: Nvidia Is Now 3rd Largest in Market Cap: More Upside Left?)\n\nAn upsurge in demand for Nvidia's chips, primarily from companies looking to upgrade their AI offerings, helped the firm post revenues of $22.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up a whopping 265% from a year ago. Similarly, Nvidia's earnings per share came in at $4.93 in the quarter ending on Jan 28, 2024, up a mind-boggling 765% from a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's chips are needed for AI models developed by companies such as Meta and Microsoft. In particular, Nvidia's data center business, which is responsible for manufacturing the H100 graphics cards utilized for AI training, saw revenues jump $18.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up a solid 409% year over year. The data center business was able to shrug off the adverse effects of government curbs on exporting advanced AI semiconductors to China.\n\nLet us not forget that the H100 graphic card has become a gold standard for AI developers for data crunching required in language models. The H100 chips are, at the moment, one of the most sought-after commodities in Silicon Valley after the rapid success of Open AI's ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Meta is planning to increase its stock of H100 chips to 350,000 by the end of this year, as mentioned by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThus, Nvidia is optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the current quarter to come in at $24 billion, way ahead of estimates. Improvement in PC shipments in recent times as price pressure eases due to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening measures is also expected to benefit the chipmaker soon. Nvidia's gaming business, too, made some advancements in the reported quarter and is expected to do well in the rest of the year.\n\nNvidia's present valuation may look stretched compared to the S&P 500 but it isn't as extreme as companies such as Cisco Systems during the dot-com bubble peak. On the contrary, thanks to the positives, Nvidia stock has more upside left, which certainly makes it a compelling buy for razor-sharp investors. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNvidia's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 58.9% and 15.6%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 52.5% and 15.5%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nvidia's current-year earnings has moved up 3.7% over the past 60 days.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has a high net profit margin since the company has been able to generate enough income from sales and has successfully kept operational costs under control. Nvidia's net profit margin is a superb 48.9%, a tell-tale sign that its shares should move northward.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "What to know about the Nvidia-led tech bubble",
        "content": "Investor sentiment is skyrocketing under Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance over the tech sector as the company continues to outperform most expectations on Wall Street. However, experts are issuing words of caution over the optimism contributing to a tech bubble forming that could very well pop.\n\nYahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi joins the Live show to give his thoughts on what investors need to know about the latest bullish calls on Nvidia, the overall tech sector, and how investors should reassess their portfolios during all this hype.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Today's top story, the AI-fueled rally is taking a bit of a breather here. Stock futures searching for direction a bit this morning as investors await the release of the Fed's, preferred inflation gauge, PCE that's coming Thursday. But before then we've got Yahoo Finance's executive editor Brian Sozzi here with us. Hey, Brian.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Hey. Brad. I was just looking at the Yahoo Finance app real quick. Nvidia shares up 1 and 1/2% premarket. I have five-year chart. You toggle to it, I mean, it just gone through the roof. But I wrote about recently the potential that this all could essentially be a bubble. You could find that piece on the Yahoo Finance home page. It really took off over the weekend in terms of just social media activity. So please keep the comments coming. I'm learning a lot from this.\n\nBut I point to three things in this story that would suggest we are in fact or investors are in fact living in an AI bubble or a hype cycle. Everything is rallying. Look what NVIDIA reported last week. You saw shares of AMD tick higher. You saw Intel tick higher. You saw Meta tick higher.\n\nI would argue in a normal environment, you do not see shares of AMD and Intel tick higher after a blowout quarter for NVIDIA because NVIDIA's numbers are telling you maybe they're taking market share from AMD and Intel. Totally bonkers. And then on Meta, just because they're using Nvidia chips the market is suggesting they might have blowout earnings later this year. That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me at least right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nNumber two, I've seen a lot of folks on the street really focus on valuations on these AI stocks, and they're justifying even higher valuations for these stocks that wouldn't even be normal. Look at-- you go to Yahoo Finance, you take on the statistics page, NVIDIA shares trading about 30 times forward earnings. That is well above the broader market multiple about 23 times. And yeah, I get it. NVIDIA should be trading at a higher multiple, and the market it is growing faster but still that is some near record high valuations for NVIDIA. And they are not alone. And a lot of folks on the street are justifying this as normal, and I would argue it's not.\n\nAnd then lastly, I think you're seeing a lot of folks think that they are absolutely unstoppable investors. They are investing geniuses. And newsflash of these folks, you're really not. What you're essentially seeing is a lot of stocks rising tide lifting all boats in many markets notably, the Magnificent Seven. It makes you feel good. It makes you feel like you really know what you're doing. And I would argue now is the time to go back and just reassess what you are in fact doing.\n\nRemember that fundamentals do drive stock prices. And I point to a really good study or a piece of research out of the Schwab team suggesting that investor confidence is at the highest level they have ever seen in doing their survey. Most investors are absolutely bullish on tech stocks, shocker. But again, there's a lot of optimism here on the AI train, and I saw it right through my social media feeds all weekend there.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Certainly, this is playing on a social media. It's been playing out in the market now for quite some time. And Sozzi, similar to your point, Torsten Slok was out with the chart here this morning talking about the current AI bubble right now. He was actually making a comparison here saying that it's bigger than the 1990s tech bubble.\n\nBut Sozzi, I'm curious from what you've heard from viewers, what you're reading here from some of the readers that have commented on your piece, how would you compare this sentiment today to what we've seen in the past given your experience and your coverage of some of the other blips, to call it, to say the least in the market?\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: You're calling me old, right? Good because I call myself old in this story.\n\nSEANA SMITH: I'm not calling you old. You just have experience, right, like--\n\nBRAD SMITH: Seasoned.\n\nSEANA SMITH: --you put it.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: I'm seasoned. All right, I appreciate that. But it is. I think investors are caught in a classic, classic bubble. And how can you tell that? All that activity that these folks that are replying to me on social media, I don't get the sense-- and via email, I should say-- I don't get the sense they're ready to exit NVIDIA or exit these Mag Seven stocks.\n\nIf anything, they have been more emboldened by the AI hype cycle, and they can't see the other side of the trade. And my point in this piece was that at some point it does end badly. Maybe it's not today. Maybe it's not tomorrow. But I think in this environment you have to go back and calculate valuations on the Magnificent Seven and really drill down is it truly justified by the cash flows and profits that will be coming over the next two to three years. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. But again, I think you have to go through that exercise.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Well, you already had Jefferies come out last week and say that Nvidia is essentially the de facto ecosystem standard for AI. And they pointed back to exactly what we're talking about, the historical context of this all too saying typically a single general purpose ecosystem captures 80% of the value of each computing era. You look back to PCs. You look back to Apple and smartphones there too.\n\nAnd so now this is how Nvidia is trying to cement their own positioning within this influential AI moment that we're in.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: One last reminder, stocks don't go up every single day, and, at some point, there will be a correction.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, there will be a correction. But like you've said in the past, they do go up most times.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: I'm not making stock calls here. I just I want people to be reminded what goes on out there.",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +29.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 23% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.92 per share, indicating a change of +351.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.18 points to a change of +63.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.98 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $24.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +233.8%. The $98.63 billion and $114.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +61.9% and +16%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $22.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +265.3%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.82%. The EPS surprise was +13.41%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What Does NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Share Price Indicate?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine NVIDIA’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nIs NVIDIA Still Cheap?\n\nNVIDIA is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that NVIDIA’s ratio of 65.18x is above its peer average of 30.93x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of NVIDIA look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing NVIDIA at this point in time.

        "content": "By Nell Mackenzie\n\nLONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Global hedge funds sold tech stocks at their highest pace in almost eight months in the week to Feb. 23, Goldman Sachs said, piling into bets against the sector just as Nvidia's latest earnings fuelled a surge in tech shares.\n\nThe tech share selling by hedge funds ranked among the highest seen in the last five years, according to the Goldman Sachs note released on Friday and seen by Reuters on Monday.\n\nStock indices, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq, have rallied to record highs on optimism about artificial intelligence. Chipmaker Nvidia added $277 billion in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history, after its quarterly report beat expectations.\n\nBut in a sign that sentiment may be turning, twice the number of hedge funds now have short bets that tech stock prices will fall versus those with long positions, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nHedge funds took out short bets against stocks from tech companies across the sector. They exited long positions and added short punts on manufacturing and service equipment for the semiconductor industry, tech hardware, storage and IT services, the bank said.\n\nThe speculators added short bets to software companies, it added.\n\nHowever, traders remained reluctant to completely sever their positive positions in tech, a separate note from Goldman Sachs said. That pointed to a two-year high in call options on Nvidia.\n\nThese are derivatives bets which only make the trader long if the stock passes a certain price threshold - a way to express a positive position in the stock but only if it rises to a certain extent.\n\nSpeculators were generally short U.S. stocks, piling into the largest net selling of the region's equity markets in five weeks, the first Goldman Sachs note said.\n\nPersistent price rises by U.S. service sector businesses have underscored the stickiness of inflation and pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024, denting hopes for a soft landing.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders ditched tech, health care and industrial stocks and instead bought the largest amount consumer staples stocks in ten weeks, adding companies which make products that people routinely buy, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThese included stocks from companies linked to distribution, retail, beverages and household products, but not tobacco, it added.\n\nRegulators worldwide have\n\nincreased scrutiny\n\non E-cigarettes, possibly spelling trouble for some big tobacco companies that make them.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in December 2023, urged governments to treat e-cigarettes similarly to tobacco and ban all flavours.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Andrew Heavens)",

        "title": "Wall Street Thinks These 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Still Have Plenty of Room to Run -- but Nvidia Isn't One of Them",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) blew nearly everyone away with its fourth-quarter results last week. The stock continued a surge that began in late 2022.\n\nMany analysts, though, are skeptical about just how much higher Nvidia can go. The average analysts' 12-month price target for the stock is 7% below the current share price. However, Wall Street thinks that three other artificial intelligence (AI) stocks still have plenty of room to run.\n\n1. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) hasn't delivered nearly the level of gains that Nvidia has. However, shares of the software company are still up more than 50% over the last 12 months. The consensus on Wall Street is that Adobe could perform very well going forward.\n\nThe average price target for Adobe reflects an upside potential of more than 21%. The most optimistic analyst thinks the stock could soar as much as 40% higher. Of the 31 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, 25 rate Adobe as a buy or strong buy. By comparison, only 21 of the 38 analysts covering Nvidia rated it as a buy or strong buy.\n\nYou might not think of Adobe as an AI stock. However, the company has integrated generative AI into many of its products. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress specifically mentioned Adobe during her company's recent quarterly conference call as one of the \"leading AI and enterprise software platforms\" that Nvidia is working with.\n\nAdobe is on a roll, generating record revenue in its fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. The company's Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud products continue to enjoy strong momentum.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that dominated the stock market last year. Over the last 12 months, shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant have soared close to 85%.\n\nAmazon's amazing run isn't over quite yet, according to some analysts. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is more than 17% above Amazon's current share price. And there are a lot of Amazon bulls on Wall Street. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February rate the stock as a buy or strong buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI is extremely important to Amazon's growth prospects. It's providing a major tailwind to the company's AWS cloud platform. AWS, like the other major cloud providers, uses Nvidia's chips. However, Amazon has also developed its own AI chips.\n\nThe transition of customers' IT spending from on-premises to the cloud, driven largely by AI, should enable Amazon to grow robustly over the next decade and beyond. The company's advertising business is another key growth driver that just might help Amazon achieve Wall Street's price target.\n\n3. Oracle\n\nOracle(NYSE: ORCL) hasn't received as much attention from investors as some AI stocks have. While shares of the database and software giant have jumped nearly 30% over the last 12 months, that performance pales in comparison with the returns delivered by Nvidia and others.\n\nWall Street thinks that Oracle can extend its gains, though. The average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of around 14%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in February, 26 rate Oracle as a buy or strong buy.\n\nOracle Cloud is another major customer of Nvidia's DGX Cloud. Chairman, co-founder, and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted in the company's December conference call that Oracle's cloud infrastructure services growth is being driven in part by generative AI customers. He added that countries building sovereign clouds (where all data is stored within a nation's borders) are also fueling growth.\n\nUnlike many other AI stocks, Oracle remains attractively valued. Its shares trade at only 17.3 times expected earnings. This relatively low price could help make Oracle more appealing to investors wanting to profit from AI without paying a steep premium.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Here's the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That's Not Overpriced, According to the \"Dean of Valuation\"",
        "content": "When stocks are categorized into a group and given a catchy nickname, you might say that they've arrived. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the \"Nifty 50\" were wildly popular. In the 1990s, \"The Four Horsemen\" grabbed investors' attention. A few years ago, the FAANG stocks were all the rage.\n\nToday, we have the \"Magnificent Seven.\" With such a superlative adjective in the nickname, you'd expect that these stocks have been huge winners -- and you'd be right. However, winning can come at a cost. That's literally true with these stocks: Most of them now have premium valuations.\n\nDon't just take my word for it. New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran is widely known as the \"Dean of Valuation\" because of his expertise in valuing stocks. Damodaran recently posted on his blog, \"On every pricing metric, the Mag Seven stocks trade at a premium over the rest of the stocks in the S&P 500.\"\n\nBut based on his own analysis, Damodaran doesn't think all of these seven stocks have excessive valuations. There's one \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that's not overpriced, according to the \"Dean of Valuation.\"\n\nCrossing two stocks off the list\n\nIt's not Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nWriting in early February, Damodaran ranked the giant chipmaker as the most expensive \"Magnificent Seven\" stock of all. At the time, he believed that Nvidia was trading nearly 56% above its fair valuation. Damodaran even posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Nvidia \"is a bridge too far for me.\" He added that he planned to reduce his position in the stock by half.\n\nKeep in mind that this was before Nvidia announced its blowout fourth-quarter results. The stock is now nearly 19% higher than it was when Damodaran said that it was way too expensive.\n\nThe NYU professor and author also wrote that Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) was clearly overvalued. In his blog several weeks ago, Damodaran revealed that the tech stock was trading nearly 14% above its fair valuation. Microsoft's share price has risen slightly since then.\n\nStory continues\n\nDamodaran did acknowledge, though, that he might be too pessimistic about Nvidia's and Microsoft's growth prospects. He stated, \"I have built in substantial value from AI in my valuation of Nvidia, and given Microsoft significantly higher growth because of it, but it is plausible that I have not done enough.\"\n\nNot too far off from fair valuations\n\nSeveral \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks weren't too far off from their fair valuations, in Damodaran's view. He wrote that Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple, and Amazon were \"within striking distance of value.\"\n\nAt the time he wrote those words, all three of these stocks traded at less than 9% above the fair values that Damodaran calculated. Alphabet and Apple have since fallen slightly, while Amazon has risen a little.\n\nMeta Platforms looked \"close to fairly valued,\" in Damodaran's opinion. The stock was trading at nearly 2.5% over its fair valuation based on his analysis. However, Meta's share price has jumped roughly 8% since Damodaran posted his blog.\n\nThe cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock of all?\n\nDamodaran determined that Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) was the cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock of all. He even revealed that he had bought shares of Tesla in the week before his blog was published online.\n\nRanking Tesla as the most attractively valued \"Magnificent Seven\" stock might be surprising. The electric vehicle maker's forward earnings multiple currently tops 63x. That doesn't scream inexpensive.\n\nHowever, Damodaran factors expected growth into his valuation model. He projected that Tesla will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of 31.1% over the next five years. When he crunched the numbers, the stock was only 0.72% above its fair value. After rising some in recent weeks, Tesla is now a little 6% over Damodaran's calculated fair value.\n\nBecause of the price changes for the seven stocks, Alphabet is now closer to Damodaran's fair value than any other \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. Importantly, the NYU professor didn't assume lofty growth for Alphabet, plugging a revenue CAGR over the next five years of only 8% into his model. This relatively low growth estimate makes his calculations less susceptible to being overly optimistic.\n\nIn my opinion, Alphabet deserves the mantle as the cheapest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" for now. I suspect that the \"Dean of Valuation\" might agree.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "By Amanda Cooper\n\nLONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The pound edged up against the dollar on Monday, heading for a fifth straight daily gain, its longest unbroken streak so far this year, but volatility was subdued, as investors took a breather from a spate of influential economic data and earnings.\n\nSterling rose 0.1% to $1.26855, marking a week-on-week gain of 0.7%. Against the euro, the pound lost 0.1% to trade around 85.48.\n\nThe pound secured its biggest one-week gain versus the dollar this year last week, boosted by the same swell of risk appetite following blockbuster results from chipmaker Nvidia and upbeat business activity surveys that helped sweep a number of stock markets to record highs.\n\nA number of major data releases are due this week from the United States, the euro zone and Japan, but not much in the way of big UK data which could keep the pound on a fairly even keel for now, according to DailyFX strategist Richard Snow.\n\n\"Sterling has performed well over the last week and with little to no ‘high impact’ data on the horizon, the currency may remain propped up on the whole,\" he said.\n\nThe pound was set for a fifth daily rise against the dollar, its longest stretch of gains since the end of December.\n\nThe futures market shows traders widely expect the Bank of England to cut rates in August, with a slim chance of a cut in June.\n\nInvestors are banking on the BoE cutting rates by around 60 basis points to just below 4.60% by December, less than half of the 120 bps in cuts that were priced in at the start of this month.\n\nNext week brings finance minister Jeremy Hunt's Spring Budget. Economists and analysts say there is not much room for fiscal loosening, particularly with a general election due later this year.\n\n\"A modest rearranging of the fiscal deck chairs is likely to be the Chancellor’s most effective plan for Budget 2024, alongside a modest support package,\" Nomura economists said in a note last week.\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds piled into tech stocks in the weeks before Nvidia Corp. earnings. Now, they’re cashing out and selling at the fastest pace in seven months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD’s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Zelenskiy Says 31,000 Troops Killed as Ukraine Seeks US Aid Decision Within Month Norwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to Outbreak Jack Ma-Backed Ant Outbids Citadel Securities for Credit Suisse’s China JV Risk Models Behind World’s Best Hedge Fund Strategy Are Getting a Lot Harder to Crack\n\nProfessional managers offloaded their positions for four straight sessions last week, including Thursday, the day after Nvidia posted results, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime-brokerage unit. The intensity of the selling ranks in the 98th percentile of the past five years.\n\nThe data suggests traders are booking profits on their tech wagers after a six-week buying streak and putting that extra cash into less volatile stocks, such as consumer staples. Companies that make household products saw the most net buying in 10 weeks, according to Goldman’s prime brokerage.\n\nIn a report, Goldman’s traders also pointed to data that underscored the market’s confidence in tech stocks. The put-call skew, often used as a measure of investor fear, has moved lower, and retail trading activity in Nvidia was in the 99.96th percentile for the week.\n\nBut with sentiment running so high, there’s reasons to be concerned. Outside of Nvidia’s one-day surge, the Nasdaq 100 struggled as it posted losses three out of the last four sessions.\n\n“This has raised some tension about the sustainability of momentum from here now,” wrote Peter Callahan, a specialist in tech, media and telecom at the bank. Now that all the big tech companies have reported, the focus of the next few days will shift to economic data and the timing of interest rate cuts, he added.\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?

        "title": "Up 200% This Year, Is It Too Late to Buy Super Micro Computer Stock?",
        "content": "Shares of Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have pulled back after hitting a 52-week high of $1,077 in February. The stock currently hovers around $873, equaling a year-to-date increase of 207%, following a positive quarterly report from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) that points to growing demand for Supermicro's server solutions.\n\nThe incredible performance has investors wondering if the company's recent growth is sustainable, and if so, how much upside may be left in the shares. Supermicro, as it is better known, is not as dominant in its market as Nvidia is in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, but that doesn't mean the stock isn't worth buying.\n\nRiding the AI boom\n\nSupermicro is a leading supplier of AI-optimized servers and rack solutions for data centers. The company's plug-and-play rack systems house the advanced chips from leading semiconductor providers, so when Nvidia reports booming demand for its chips, it is good news for Supermicro's business.\n\nIt is starting to see accelerating revenue growth as the supply of AI chips becomes more available in 2024. The company averaged annualized top-line growth of 20% over the last 10 years, but revenue accelerated to a year-over-year increase of 103% in the quarter ending in December.\n\nThe stock's run this year shows that investors expect last quarter's impressive growth to continue, as more data centers shift away from central processing units (CPUs) toward the more powerful processing capabilities that graphics processing units (GPUs) provide for AI training.\n\nIs this Supermicro's biggest weakness?\n\nInvestors should be aware that Supermicro operates in a competitive industry, which is evident by the company's low profit margin. Most businesses convert about 10% of their revenue to a profit, but Supermicro's profit margin was 8% over the last year. By comparison, Nvidia's dominance in AI chips allows it to command premium prices for its products and earn a lofty profit margin of 42%.\n\nStory continues SMCI Profit Margin Chart\n\nSupermicro's low margin doesn't leave it a lot of room to keep profits up if revenue were to dip due to a sluggish environment for data center spending. But the company's improving margin shows the AI boom is playing to its strengths.\n\nSupermicro has a competitive advantage in being first to market with new innovations in storage and server systems, and this is why many companies turn to its server products as interest in AI grows.\n\nWhat is Supermicro stock's upside?\n\n\"The exciting news is that finally, we are entering in an accelerating demand phase from many more customer wins,\" CEO Charles Liang said on the company's recent earnings call. The company's commentary and actions point to a huge opportunity ahead.\n\nAll investors need to do is look where the business is investing. Supermicro is in the process of opening a new facility in Malaysia to expand production capacity, which Liang said will support annual revenue in excess of $25 billion.\n\nCompany guidance calls for strong demand to continue in the second half of fiscal 2024, with full-year revenue reaching $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion, or more than double fiscal 2023 revenue. SMCI Annual EPS Estimates Chart\n\nGiven the long-term tailwinds that are driving growth for AI-optimized data center infrastructure, Supermicro can likely increase revenue by double-digit rates for several years. Analysts expect revenue to reach $20.3 billion by fiscal 2026, with earnings per share of $33. Using those estimates, the stock could climb to over $1,300 in the next few years if it is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 40.\n\nSupermicro is a low-margin business that reflects the stiff competition for server solutions, but it is encouraging that management is seeing more customers come to it first as AI demand heats up. While I would never bet the house on any stock no matter how well it is performing, I believe Super Micro shares could still hit new highs in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Built on the Now Platform, Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management leverages NVIDIA AI to help boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance time to value.\n\nBARCELONA, Spain, February 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mobile World Congress:ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the leading digital workflow company making the world work better for everyone, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced that they are broadening their relationship with the introduction of telco-specific generative AI solutions to elevate service experiences.\n\nThe first solution, Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management (TSM), is built on the Now Platform and uses NVIDIA AI to help boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance customer experiences. As telcos look to reduce costs and uncover new business opportunities, they’re turning to AI and automation. In a survey from IDC, 73% of global telecommunications service providers identified AI/ML investments to support operations as their top transformation priority.1\n\n\"GenAI is a game-changer for telcos looking to boost productivity, improve customer experiences, and drive cost savings with its ability to learn and improve with each use,\" said Rohit Batra, general manager and vice president for telecom, media, and tech at ServiceNow. \"Together, ServiceNow and NVIDIA will help telcos realize unprecedented business value and impact, fast. This is just the beginning of a large-scale transformation for the industry, and we’re excited to be at the forefront.\"\n\n\"The telco industry is rapidly evolving as AI makes its mark on enterprises everywhere,\" said Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at NVIDIA. \"Our partnership with ServiceNow will help telcos leverage GenAI to tackle their unique challenges and build better, stronger, more efficient experiences.\"\n\nMany features within Now Assist are powered by ServiceNow fine-tuned large language models, as well as served using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™ and customized with NVIDIA NeMo™, both included with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform for the development and deployment of production-grade AI applications, including generative AI cutting-edge innovation for business-critical use cases, including:\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomer Care: Telco customer service agents are expected to provide customers with accurate, fast support. GenAI-powered chat summarization and agent assist capabilities help boost productivity and play a pivotal role in call deflection. GenAI can summarize case activity, work notes, and customer interactions, and guide agents with next best actions. This helps agents serve customers quickly and focus on complex queries that require personalized attention—leading to overall better customer experiences. Service Assurance: GenAI provides service assurance teams, stakeholders, and customers a streamlined and rapid understanding of incidents. Take a fiber cut, a common service assurance use case that can have problematic and financial consequences for telcos. Incident management teams face a slew of challenges when handling these incidents, dealing with technical data and the risk of misinterpretation due to specialized terminology and acronyms. GenAI helps decipher technical jargon, distill complex information into clear, concise summaries designed to speed time to resolution, drive cost savings, and improve customer experiences.\n\nServiceNow and NVIDIA plan to build out additional telco-specific GenAI use cases based on the unique needs of customers. Together, the companies are working to solve the industry’s biggest challenges and drive business transformation for telcos globally.\n\nPartnering for responsible and safe AI\n\nThe telco use cases are an extension of ServiceNow and NVIDIA’s partnership announced in May 2023.\n\n1IDC, 2023 Telecommunications Service Provider Transformation Plans and Strategies Survey Highlights, Doc # US49352223, May 2023\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFind out how generative AI can help cloud service providers improve business processes, customer experience, and network management.\n\nAvailability\n\nNow Assist for TSM is available today.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\n\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. For the third straight quarterly period, the company blew past management's own revenue guidance by more than $2 billion. The technology company is the clear leader in advancing the many uses of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFor Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, the company reported sales of $22.1 billion. That's an increase of 265% versus the year ago period, and well above the prior guidance of $20 billion.\n\nNvidia and the AI boom\n\nThis one chart pretty much tells the whole story: Data Source: Statista\n\nLast year marked an explosion in sales for the data center segment that includes advanced AI chips. Three of Nvidia's four business segments increased revenue year over year in its fourth quarter, with automotive being the only laggard. But the data center segment is the focus right now. Data center revenue was more than 400% higher than the prior year period.\n\nThe company believes that escalation will continue as management believes total sales will be about $24 billion in the current quarter. These are also high margin products. In its full fiscal year 2024, gross profit margin expanded to almost 73% compared to just 57% in fiscal 2023. That's expected to continue to rise to more than 76% in the current fiscal 2025 first quarter.\n\nOf course investors have noticed these astounding numbers and Nvidia stock has rocketed higher along with its sales and earnings.\n\nWhile there will likely be ups and downs in the stock, it still doesn't look overly expensive. That's because of the still-accelerating growth. While a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 is pricey by traditional standards, that metric could decrease quickly as earnings expand.\n\nAnd the company still has potential for other areas to balloon. The previously mentioned automotive segment could grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. That's just one more reason to ensure Nvidia has a place in the growth stock portion of any portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer continues to challenge the market bears after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) smashed the Wall Street estimates with another stunning quarter, essentially proving that the AI rally that kept giving a boost to stocks in 2023 was not based on a hype after all. Cramer recently said in his program \"Mad Money\" on CNBC that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  did not defy gravity with its latest earnings, rather it defied the \"unwarranted negativity\" and \"cynicism.\" Cramer said the performance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stock has proved wrong the idea that stocks are \"hostage\" to an \"all powerful Fed.\"\n\nCramer said that he kept recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  shares all along because he knew the company's chips are much faster than its competitors like Intel. Cramer said \"for years\" he believed Nvidia stock would look cheap in \"retrospect\" because its earnings would always be much higher than expected. Cramer lamented:\n\n\"I documented this time and time again yet for ages nobody seemed to catch on.\"\n\nWhy Didn't People Listen to Cramer on NVIDIA?\n\nJim Cramer wondered why people failed to foresee the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over all these years? Jim Cramer believes part of the reason why nobody was willing to listen to his advice on buying Nvidia stock was the Fed-related fears. Cramer said it makes sense to pay attention to what the Fed is doing but believing that you should not own any stocks if rates are high causes you to miss on the benefits of owning top stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Cramer said back in the day he made \"millions of bucks\" when the Federal Reserve was raising rates aggressively. Cramer said too many people dwell on unimportant details and \"miss the big picture.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer's Advice: \"Unshackle Yourself from the Chains of the Macro\"\n\nCramer also said that the Federal Reserve's actions are mostly relevant for big hedge funds which \"only invest in the averages.\" Jim Cramer said people should notice \"how rarely they (big hedge funds) talk about individual stocks.\"\n\nJim Cramer said people should pay attention to high quality names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) because the leadership at these companies have a long-term vision and investors have a high chance of making money if they \"stick\" with them. Cramer said you need \"curiosity\" and you have to \"unshackle yourself from the chains of the macro\" to see the true potential of companies like Nvidia before they become big. Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These Stocks Stock Picks\n\n11. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer has been bearish on Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) for a long time. Earlier this month he yet again reiterated his bearish case on Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP), whose shares are up about 12% this year through February 25.\n\n\"I have no idea what it really owns. I will not recommend stocks on Mad Money when I do not know what they own.”\n\n10. AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on Texas-based  space-based cellular broadband network company AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS) and recommends investors not to buy the stock. Cramer recently said that he does not see \"any way shape or form that they’re going to be making money, so I’m going to have to hold off that one.”\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, eight hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS). The biggest stake in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS) is owned by Sander Gerber's Hudson Bay Capital Management which owns a $4.5 million stake in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS).\n\n9. Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked whether ecommerce SaaS platform company Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC) shares should be bought. Cramer's reply was \"no\" because he thinks \"we got Amazon.\"\n\nCramer has long been a believer of best of breed stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and he believes when there's a first-grade, top quality player available in any industry it should be given preference instead of buying other smaller players.\n\n8. C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nJim Cramer has said in the past that there's too much hype around the shares of C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI). Earlier this month he was yet again asked about the stock. Cramer said he does not see \"any earnings\" there and he cannot recommend a stock \"that has no earnings.\"\n\nHowever, Cramer praised C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) CEO Thomas Siebel and said he's a \"bankable guy\" and he's known Siebel for 30 years.\n\nTo ride the AI wave Cramer recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our final new short position is in a company called C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”\n\n7. Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Mississippi-based fresh eggs producer Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM). Cramer said it's an \"unnecessary stock to own.\" Cramer however said he does like Tyson Foods from a valuation perspective.\n\nThe dividend-paying company missed fiscal Q2 estimates when it posted earnings in January. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $0.35, missing estimates by $0.48. Revenue in the quarter fell 34.7% year over year to $523.23 million, missing estimates by $2.16 million\n\nDiamond Hill Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included Civitas Resources and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Fresh egg producer Cal-Maine Foods has positioned itself well to capitalize on the growing trend toward cage-free and specialty eggs. In May, the US Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12, whereby California can dictate only cage-free eggs be sold in the state — an outcome which will likely open the door for other states to either institute or maintain similar mandates, and which should drive increased long-term demand for Cal-Maine Foods’ eggs.”\n\n6. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nSurgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from. Last month Cramer said he was taking a \"hard pass\" on the stock. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) shares are however up about 4.4% year to date through February 25.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds out of the 933 funds had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The most notable stakeholder of Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) was Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $175 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).\n\nInstead of SGRY, Cramer is recommending big stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "There have never been more millionaires than today. Indeed, Statista estimates that as of December 2023, there were 22.7 million millionaires in the United States, roughly 9% of the American population.\n\nOne big reason why: The current bull market, and, in particular, the artificial intelligence (AI) stocks that are powering it higher. So, let's take a look at two millionaire-maker AI stocks that still have plenty of room to run. These stocks may not be cheap today, but they may be worth every premium penny in the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nFirst up is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). There are many reasons why the world's largest company has made, and will continue to make, countless millionaires, but I want to cover one specifically: Microsoft is poised to grow its often underappreciated search and news advertising business.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31), Microsoft's search and news ad segment generated $3.2 billion in revenue. That's a tidy sum, similar to the revenue Roku generated over the last 12 months ($3.4 billion).\n\nHowever, for Microsoft, the $3.2 billion it generates from advertising is but a drop in the bucket. The company makes about $62 billion in quarterly revenue. So to some investors, its digital ad segment revenue is often an afterthought -- particularly when compared to the true digital ad giants like Alphabet and MetaPlatforms.\n\nHowever, thanks to its partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft might be able to force its way into the digital ad conversation. Recent reports suggest that OpenAI may be working on a search engine designed to rival Alphabet's flagship Google Search. Crucially, Microsoft was quick to adopt key ChatGPT features into its Bing search engine last year, leading to the possibility that Microsoft might once again quickly adopt any future breakthroughs.\n\nAt any rate, it is clear Microsoft has room to grow when it comes to the digital ad market. The overall market is likely to expand to $966 billion by 2028. If Microsoft can use AI innovations to improve the popularity of its search and news products, it could turn an unsung revenue stream into a giant in its own right.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNext is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the undisputed AI king. Indeed, Nvidia has undergone nothing short of an explosion in demand, both for its products and its stock, since AI took the limelight last year. In terms of market cap, Nvidia is now America's third-largest company, trailing only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe company's surging fortunes are partly thanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to train large language models like ChatGPT. There is, however, another reason that isn't discussed as often: Nvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) interface.\n\nWithout getting too technical, CUDA is a proprietary software framework that helps developers tap into the power of GPUs for training AI models. In short, it is Nvidia's secret weapon that makes its GPUs so desirable for AI developers, and it helps explain why Nvidia likely has around 90% share of the data center GPU market.\n\nFinancially, CUDA gives Nvidia a strong, strategic moat -- making it difficult for rivals like Advanced Micro Devices or Intel to gain market share. They rely on the OpenCL standard instead, but this open-source system offers significantly slower performance than Nvidia's proprietary language.\n\nAt any rate, there's no doubt that Nvidia is like a freight train cruising downhill -- seemingly unstoppable. In its latest quarter (the three months ending Jan. 28), Nvidia reported $22.1 billion in revenue, up 265% from a year earlier. Yes, you read that correctly, Nvidia's quarterly revenue almost tripled from a year ago. Its data center revenue increased 409%, going from $4.5 billion to $18.4 billion. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn short, Nvidia's CUDA moat is driving enormous shareholder returns, and it remains a company that could make more millionaires for some time.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "Yep, you are living in a Nvidia-led tech bubble",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nGetting old sucks, and I don't like it one bit.\n\nMy hair is thinning. I don't wake up at 1:45 a.m. each day with the same fiery energy to obsess over markets and stocks. I am down to eating red meat three times a month \"just because\" it's what people have told me is the right thing to do at this point in life.\n\nFrom what I can tell, one of the only positives of getting old is experience.\n\nAnd my experience in analyzing and reporting on markets and leaders for more than a decade tells me that investors have become fully engulfed in an AI-fueled tech bubble.\n\nTo be fair, this feels like a much different bubble than the cannabis and crypto stock bubbles of years gone by, as tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) have real money-minting business models. Their leaders also aren't inexperienced dopes (see the cryptosphere's bad actors of the last two years).\n\nBut make no mistake: We are in a bubble, and it could end badly at some point.\n\nHere are some of the elements I see to support this view.\n\nEverything rallies, but should it?\n\nNvidia shares ripped 15% higher last Thursday after earnings. The report sent the broader market ripping higher too.\n\nNvidia rivals AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM) saw strong bids. New hot Yahoo Finance ticker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) exploded by 36%. Even Intel (INTC) caught some Nvidia tailwinds. And shares of Meta (META), which has been out in front in buying Nvidia chips, shot higher as well.\n\nDoesn't this all look insane and feel akin to blind buying by FOMO traders?\n\nIn a normal functioning market, Nvidia doing amazingly is bad news for competitors such as AMD and Intel. Nvidia is selling more of its chips, meaning fewer sales opportunities for rivals. Shouldn't their stocks drop?\n\nStory continues\n\nJust because Meta owns and uses some new Nvidia chips, how is that going to positively impact its earnings and cash flow over the next four quarters? Will it at all?\n\nThe point is that investors are acting irrationally as Nvidia serves up eye-popping financial figures and the hype machine descends on social media. It makes sense until it doesn't, and that is classic bubble action.\n\nJustifying inflated valuations\n\nStill not convinced this is an AI-fueled tech bubble?\n\nThen cast your eyes on the typical Wall Street action of justifying ever-higher valuation multiples on stocks. Tech price-to-earnings multiples are rich. Is this the making of an AI-fueled bubble?\n\n\"At 29x our calendar year 2024 estimated [earnings per share], Nvidia trades at a lower multiple vs. peers Intel and AMD,\" one analyst wrote in a note following the Nvidia earnings stampede. \"We view the valuation as compelling. Nvidia remains a top pick.\"\n\nI am not saying Nvidia shouldn't be valued at a premium to the market — not saying that at all, so don't shred me via email.\n\nWhat I am asking you to do is to deconstruct the above commentary, which is creeping more and more into tech coverage.\n\nThe analyst, in this case, has rationalized that 1) high price multiples for slower growers Intel and AMD are OK because AI is so hot, or so it seems, and 2) Nvidia's stock deserves to trade at about a 33% premium to an already rich P/E multiple on the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia's valuation isn't mind-blowingly compelling considering earnings estimates have been jacked up to the ceiling! This is a priced-for-absolute-perfection tech stock.\n\nBut hey, inside a tech bubble, anything goes, right?\n\nThinking you can't be stopped\n\nNothing says \"investing bubble\" like unbridled confidence. It's that feeling that whatever stock you buy — at whatever price and at whatever time — will only go up forever. This makes you feel like an investing genius and inclined to take on more risk.\n\nHere's a dose of insight that shows a ton of overconfidence sweeping through markets.\n\nTraders’ confidence in their own decision making, consistent with bullishness, just hit the highest level since Charles Schwab began its Trader Sentiment survey, the financial services firm said this week. From a sector perspective, traders are most bullish on information technology (shocker). They are very upbeat on AI stocks in particular (shocker).\n\nNews flash: You aren't an investing genius. The best thing you can do right now to grow your wealth is realize it's time to lay the groundwork to begin protecting your wealth that has been created by the tech bubble.\n\nLean on your investing experience and all its wrinkles.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "You Don't Have to Buy Nvidia to Benefit From Its Explosive Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth. You Can Buy These 2 Stocks Instead.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) just reported another quarter of explosive growth, with revenue and net income climbing in the triple digits into the billions of dollars. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader scored big as more and more companies flocked to buy its top-performing chip and related products and services. And Nvidia's revenue even reached a record at more than $22 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia's stock has soared about 285% over the past year. Even after these gains, Nvidia still remains a great stock to buy thanks to its solid future prospects. But there's another way to benefit from Nvidia's growth -- without even owning the stock. And that's by investing in companies that work hand in hand with this chip giant, and two perfect examples are leading cloud service provider Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), through Amazon Web Services (AWS), and server giant Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nWhy would you want to do this? Because it offers you the best of both worlds: Nvidia's growth along with exposure to another top-notch business operating in other compelling areas. Let's take a closer look at each. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon's AWS is the world's leading cloud services provider, and it also generally drives overall profitability at the company. AWS offers clients a wide variety of cloud solutions, and in recent times, it's put the focus on AI, investing in technology infrastructure and in supporting clients across their AI projects.\n\nBy buying Amazon shares, you can benefit from Nvidia's growth because the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), or the chips powering AI, are found in AWS' offerings. And at AWS, you'll also find various Nvidia products and services such as the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform to accelerate AI development. Late last year, AWS and Nvidia even announced an extension of their collaboration to include new projects, such as work to create the world's fastest AI supercomputer -- powered by Nvidia GPUs of course.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd since so many companies already use AWS, it's likely they'll stick with the cloud services provider when they're looking for Nvidia products and services. All of this represents a huge revenue growth opportunity for Amazon moving forward.\n\nOn top of this, when you buy Amazon shares, you also benefit from the company's e-commerce business, which is another area with top growth prospects and a solid earnings track record. So, trading for 41x forward earnings estimates, Amazon makes a top buy right now.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro is a seller of servers, storage systems, full rack scale solutions, and related products. Now here's where things get exciting: The company uses a building blocks method of constructing its products so that it assembles a rack, for instance, according to the customer's needs.\n\nAnd Supermicro monitors Nvidia's product development so that it can ensure its own products are compatible -- and ready to integrate the Nvidia innovation as soon as it's released. Supermicro also maintains this collaborative relationship with other chip companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel so it's able to benefit from the growth of all players in the space.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro offers customers a customized product, powered by the world's fastest chips as soon as they hit the market. In the most recent quarter, the company said it saw record demand for systems at rack scale, incorporating chips from Nvidia and other market leaders.\n\nSupermicro's earnings have roared higher in recent times thanks to its close work with these AI chip giants, and in the fiscal year 2023 -- 30 years after the company launched -- it reported its first $2 billion quarter. Now, the company predicts revenue for the current full fiscal year to climb at least 101% to $14.3 billion.\n\nAll of this means that when the leading chipmakers win, so does Supermicro. And that makes the valuation of 40x forward earnings estimates look pretty reasonable for this top AI growth stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best major stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and some recent trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nThe start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand.\n\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends.\n\nThis is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history. Quite a sharp turnaround from the tail end of 2022 had seen speculation far and wide that a recession was incoming and that everyone should batten down their hatches.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like 2023 saw the NASDAQ 100 soar to new highs on the back of major stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 2024's record setting index levels are also influenced by such companies. The start of the year ushered in all important earnings season that saw major stocks the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) take the lead on the artificial intelligence front. A.I. was the biggest theme on the stock market last year, and the mega stock earnings calls saw their management share strategies about costs, future plans, and other data that investors parsed over with eagle eyes to see whether the hype in A.I. is really worth investing in.\n\nAnd as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor.\n\nBefore we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.\n\nSo, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in? We took a look and some notable picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best major stocks to buy, we made a list of the common top constituents of the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ 100 index and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen as the best major stocks to buy.\n\nFor these best major stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\n13. Intuit Inc.

        "title": "14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 14 best beaten down stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest events in the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were used to at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and in its immediate aftermath. Before the pandemic, global stocks and the Chinese economy were performing quite well and there was a growing narrative that perhaps America's days as a global economy might be coming to an end, with up and comers the likes of China all ready to challenge U.S. dominance. Similarly, the stock market was used to low interest rates, and as the coronavirus stimulus packages and the monetary policy of that time showed, there was nowhere but up for stocks to go.\n\nNow, the environment is different. Not only have the major European economies of the U.K. and Germany entered into a recession, but it seems like the American economy still has a lot of juice left when it comes to leading the world. This is because Chinese economic ails simply refuse to go away, and the start of 2024 has also seen billions of dollars flow out of the country's equity markets as the prospects of a robust economic recovery appear to dim down.\n\nHowever, even though the American economy has been an exception for the last year or so, this doesn't mean that the future is clear. The start of the year saw stock market investors deal with the same set of challenges that they had become accustomed to in 2023. The two key stock market themes in 2024 are interest rates and artificial intelligence, and so far, they've turned out to be bearish and bullish indicators, respectively. While AI stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have already posted double digit percentage returns year to date, indexes such as the S&P 500 have pared back from their new all time records as inflation continues to be stubborn and the first rate cut dates from the Federal Reserve are still unclear.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the inflationary side, the latest data set to dent investor hopes for rapid rate cuts is the producer price index (PPI). This data set measures 'inflation out of the gate' i.e., the product prices as they leave factories and make their way to retailers. Naturally, it is a leading inflation indicator and higher PPI readings can hint at higher consumer prices down the road. For January 2024, the PPI rose by 0.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, which ended up overshooting economist estimates. Naturally, the markets weren't impressed, and as the data made rounds, major indexes registered significant drops, led by the tech heavy NASDAQ index that lost 82 basis points.\n\nYet, an 82 basis point drop is still rather small when we consider some beaten down stocks that have marked significant drops. Two such beaten down stocks are the shares of the semiconductor firm Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) and the ride sharing firm Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT). Starting from the former, Super Micro's shares had posted stunning triple digit percentage gains of 250% year to date as of February 15th, 2024. Then in the following days, they have dropped by 20% so far, making the stock quite an interesting case study for breakout and beaten down stocks. The Super Micro breakout took place as investors determined that it had successfully established itself as a key partner to NVIDIA and others. The beating took place after Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) warned that while the firm has significant AI upside, this has already been priced into the shares.\n\nWhat about Lyft? Well, its shares soared by 57% after the latest earnings release but soon reversed the trend as management shared that the margin expansion estimate for 2024 will be 50 basis points instead of the 500 basis points that the official release had stated. Margin expansion means that Lyft earns more profit per dollar unit of sales, and naturally, the stock fell after the correction.\n\nSo, if you're wondering about the best beaten down stocks to buy, we made such a list and the top names are Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG), Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). 14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best beaten down stocks, we first made a list of all stocks that have set a new 52 week low and have a market capitalization greater than $300 million. Then, they were ranked with their year to date share price performance, and the 40 stocks with the most percentage drops were chosen. Finally, this list of  beaten down stocks was re-ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023, and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best beaten down stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n14.

        "title": "This 1 Number May Ensure Nvidia's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chip Dominance",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has soared over 435% since the beginning of 2023 as companies flock to the tech giant for its top-performing suite of artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Its top and bottom lines have exploded, rising at triple-digit rates quarter after quarter. In the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, revenue reached a record high $22.1 billion, and net income rose to $12.3 billion.\n\nBut even amid this good news, investors have worried about one thing: competition. Nvidia faces challenges from fellow chip designers like Advanced Micro Devices and even some of its partners like Amazon Web Services (AWS). But before you worry too much about rivals dethroning this market giant, it's important to look at one particular number -- one that may ensure Nvidia's AI chip dominance going forward.\n\nI'm talking about research and development (R&D) spending. As you can see below, Nvidia's R&D expenses have climbed over the years, reaching $8.7 billion in fiscal 2024. That's up nearly 500% in just seven years, indicating Nvidia has been focused on driving innovation over that period. Data source: Statista.\n\nNvidia's 80% market share\n\nToday, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, so the company has a clear advantage. But at the same time, rivals are doing what they can to chip away at Nvidia's lead.\n\nAMD released a new high-performance chip late last year, and though it's slower than Nvidia's top product, it may win over some cost-conscious customers. AWS is also aiming for customers on a budget with its offering of chips for training language models and inference. And these are just two examples.\n\nThis is why it's essential for Nvidia to pour resources into R&D to keep innovating so its chips will continue to lead the market. That gives the company pricing power, and it should ensure its AI chip dominance over the long term.\n\nAnd these efforts, along with an excellent earnings track record, make Nvidia a great growth stock to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no stop in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.\n\nOther than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.\n\nAI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.\n\nIn addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:\n\n“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.\n\nAs we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEffects of AI on Labor\n\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.\n\nFor emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.\n\nWe also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\n11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $196.65\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.\n\n34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $206.15\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.\n\nOn February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a GAAP EPS of $2.18, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.07. The revenue jumped 2.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $119.6 billion, topping the estimates by $1.34 billion.\n\nMairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”\n\n9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $164.59\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 214\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.\n\nFirst Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”\n\n8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $469.58\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.\n\nOn February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.\n\nOn February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.\n\nWe also believe that Microsoft is one of the best competitively positioned large-cap companies with its vertically integrated software stack (infrastructure + applications), while the inflection in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and GenAI represents potentially the biggest addressable market expansion for the company in recent history. We also view Microsoft’s competitive positioning in AI as advantaged thanks to both the fact that it does not face an innovators dilemma in its core business (as compared with Alphabet’s core search business, which could potentially be at risk due to GenAI). Microsoft also has a tight partnership with OpenAI, has a large proprietary data asset built over time, and has a go-to-market advantage through a vast and robust partner ecosystem and its significant installed base and product bundling opportunities. These should enable it to cross-sell its existing user base as AI becomes embedded into current and new products…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $122.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\n\nSynaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.\n\nOn February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a  non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.\n\nTimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”\n\n6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $653.43\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 105 hedge funds owned a stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s stock. Fisher Asset Management was the most significant stakeholder in the company, with 4.56 million shares worth $2.72 billion, representing 1.33% of the portfolio.\n\nOut of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nRekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nPolen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Best Japanese Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Invest In 15 Best Family Vacations on a Budget for $5000\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "This May Be Nvidia's New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Driver. Could the Stock Continue to Soar?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) revenue has been soaring quarter after quarter thanks to its expertise in powering artificial intelligence (AI) projects. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest around, driving one of the key elements of AI: the deep learning of AI models, which serves as a starting point for their incredible performance down the road.\n\nAll of this has helped Nvidia's data center revenue reach record levels, climbing more than 400% to $18.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But this data center business doesn't stop at just a suite of leading AI chips. The company offers customers a full array of products and services through the data center unit to help them advance their AI platforms. And one of these offerings is software and services, a business that just reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate in the quarter.\n\nIn fact, CEO Jensen Huang said during the earnings call that software should become \"a very significant business over time.\" All of this suggests software might be Nvidia's new AI growth driver, further expanding the company's opportunities to dominate in this hot technology. Could this high-flying stock continue to soar? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's software opportunity\n\nSo what is this software opportunity all about? Well, let's consider what companies could do with AI on their own and then see what Nvidia offers. To build an AI software platform, a company could gather various open-source software elements to include in its existing infrastructure.\n\nBut relying on a vast number of open-source packages makes it hard to maintain security and stability -- and those aren't minor issues. Failure in these two areas could lead to failure of an entire AI project. And many companies don't have the engineering resources necessary to keep their software stack running both on site and through every cloud service provider worldwide.\n\nThis is where Nvidia comes in with its Nvidia AI Enterprise, a sort of operating system for AI. Through enterprise, Nvidia manages a customer's software stack, doing everything from optimizing to updating and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the pre-trained models and tools available through the software system help customers gain when it comes to efficiency, therefore reducing costs over time. For instance, the Nvidia Rapids accelerator, which uses GPUs, when paired with the Apache Spark data processing system makes the job five times faster and cuts operational costs by five -- this is compared to systems relying on central processing units (CPUs).\n\n\"My guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise,\" Huang said during the earnings report.\n\nGPUs are the key\n\nAll this suggests software could indeed be the next growth driver for Nvidia. Yes, the company's top GPUs are the key product behind all of its other offerings. But by expanding into robust and varied products and services harnessing the power of these high-performing chips, Nvidia is extending its growth opportunity. And software, due to its essential role in AI, could offer Nvidia its next big AI growth driver.\n\nDoes this mean Nvidia may continue to soar even after climbing more than 270% over the past year? It definitely suggests Nvidia has what it takes to continue to advance over the long term -- even if it marks a pause here and there.\n\nThat's because Nvidia's software ambitions confirm the company isn't just about the GPU. Yes, the tech giant must stay ahead of rivals when it comes to chip performance -- and its increases in research and development (R&D) spending indicate that's a priority. Last year, Nvidia's R&D spending rose 18% compared to the previous year.\n\nNvidia's software strategy, and the fact that its software platform is available through all the leading cloud providers, show us yet another area that could drive spectacular growth moving forward. And that should drive further share price gains over time.\n\nAll of this means Nvidia today, trading at 32x forward earnings estimates, looks pretty cheap for a company with so much long-term potential. And that makes this growth stock that's already soared still an excellent buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL): Undervalued and Overlooked Magnificent Seven Stock",
        "content": "Magnificent Seven stocks have attracted plenty of buzz as investors gravitate toward their vast market share and exceptional returns. Every Magnificent Seven stock has more than doubled over the past five years. These assets have significantly outperformed the market during that time. However, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a largely underappreciated stock.\n\nThe corporation has amassed a $1.75 trillion market cap and is up by 56% over the past year. Still, that gain falls behind most of the Magnificent Seven stocks. New opportunities and a good valuation can help Alphabet gain momentum and accumulate long-term returns for investors. Those catalysts make me bullish on the stock.\n\nAlphabet Has Underperformed the Magnificent Seven\n\nAlthough the company owns the largest search engine in the world, it’s fallen behind the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years. These are the one-year and five-year returns for each stock within the cohort.\n\nOne-year returns:\n\nNvidia: 223% Meta Platforms: 171% Amazon: 77% Microsoft: 58% Alphabet: 56% Apple: 22% Tesla: -2%\n\nFive-year returns:\n\nNvidia: 1,579% Tesla: 882% Apple: 320% Microsoft: 260% Meta Platforms: 187% Alphabet: 157% Amazon: 106%\n\nThese are still impressive returns and outpace the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq 100 (NDX). However, Alphabet has been outclassed by every Magnificent Seven stock except Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet Trades at a Great Valuation\n\nWhile the stock has underperformed its peers within the cohort, Alphabet has a better valuation than most tech companies. The stock trades at a 24.5 P/E ratio and has solid profit margins. The company’s net profit margin usually exceeds 20% and should get a big boost in future quarters.\n\nAlphabet has three components on its side: rising revenue, more profits, and cost-cutting measures. The tech giant reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 51.8% year-over-year net income growth in Q4 2023. Alphabet’s efforts to trim its workforce contributed to higher margins and seem to be ongoing.\n\nStory continues\n\nA contributing factor to Alphabet’s rising net income is the recent profitability of Google Cloud. The cloud computing segment has been taking up a larger percentage of revenue and attributed to more than 10% of Q4-2023 revenue. Google Cloud generated $9.2 billion of the company’s $86.3 billion in revenue. Google Cloud swung from a $186 million operating loss in Q4 2022 to generating $864 million in operating income in Q4 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s margins should improve significantly in future quarters and reduce the company’s P/E ratio by increasing its earnings.\n\nAdvertising Revenue Is Rebounding\n\nWhile it’s nice to see Alphabet expanding in other verticals, it’s no secret that advertising is the main engine for this corporation. Advertising sales slowed down in 2022 but came back to life in 2023. Its fourth-quarter results further highlight this fact and suggest that Alphabet has more to gain.\n\nThe fourth quarter featured $76.3 billion in Google Services revenue. This segment mainly consists of the company’s advertising and grew by 12.5% year-over-year. Advertising should receive an additional boost from the Olympic Games and the upcoming Presidential Election.\n\nHigher advertising revenue also translates into more profits. While the same can be said about most businesses, Alphabet achieved a 35.0% operating margin with its Google Services segment in Q4.\n\nAI Presents Another Long-Term Growth Opportunity\n\nAmong the Magnificent Seven stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the clear leaders in the artificial intelligence industry. However, Alphabet is also poised to gain a meaningful slice of the pie by using its existing technology and making new investments.\n\nAlphabet recently launched Gemini in a bid to bolster its AI presence. The tech firm also invested over $2 billion into an OpenAI competitor. Alphabet has been using artificial intelligence to improve its search results and cloud platform, but these investments represent the next steps to gain market share.\n\nAlphabet can close the gap in the AI race with Microsoft. The company started Google Cloud two years after Amazon got a head start with Amazon Web Services. Now, Google Cloud is a critical component of the company’s business. Alphabet has invested in many ventures known as Other Bets that are growing at a high rate. While this segment makes up a small part of total revenue, it’s worth monitoring the collection of businesses under the umbrella term.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMost analysts are bullish on Alphabet stock. The stock sports 29 Buys and eight Hold ratings from analysts, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target of $164.59 implies 14.3% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Alphabet Stock\n\nAlphabet is an under-the-radar stock (relatively) due to the impressive performances of other Magnificent Seven stocks. The tech giant has outperformed the market but has underperformed most of the corporations in its cohort.\n\nRising revenue and profits from advertising and cloud computing present a great opportunity. Alphabet also seems determined to gain more market share in artificial intelligence, which is a great long-term move for the corporation.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia or Super Micro Computer?",
        "content": "While artificial intelligence (AI) is widely considered a software program, it requires hardware to develop and power it. This leads to investors looking for \"pick-and-shovel\" style investments, as these companies sell the tools needed to power these processes (similar to how many businesses sold picks and shovels to gold miners during the various gold rushes throughout U.S. history).\n\nTwo of the top \"pick-and-shovel\" plays in the AI market are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Both stocks have been rocket ships since the start of 2023, with Nvidia and Super Micro Computer's (often called Supermicro) stocks up 437% and 1,000%, respectively.\n\nBut which one is the better buy now? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia and Super Micro Computer are complementary businesses\n\nWhile both companies could be considered \"pick-and-shovel\" investments, in reality, Nvidia makes the shovel and pick heads, while Supermicro assembles the tools and sells them to end users.\n\nNvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle the complex workloads that AI models require. These hardware pieces have been around for a long time and were originally used to process gaming graphics, but have since expanded their usage to engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training.\n\nWhen companies want to build a supercomputer to harness the power of data through AI, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy hundreds or thousands. To get the most use out of them, they must also be strategically placed and connected to a server, which is where Supermicro comes in.\n\nSupermicro builds these servers for clients and offers highly configurable models that can be tailored to end-use and computing power expectations. They work closely with Nvidia to ensure they're squeezing every ounce of performance out of their servers, which benefits users in the long run.\n\nBut as to which makes more sense to invest in, there's a clear choice.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is the superior investment at these prices\n\nSupermicro is heavily dependent on Nvidia for business. If Nvidia chooses to fulfill GPU orders to other clients or the relationship sours, Supermicro's business will be crushed. These two companies have been partners for a while, so I don't see this happening, but it is something to keep in mind.\n\nFurthermore, Supermicro has fierce competition from other server builders like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, while Nvidia's AI GPUs are in a class of their own.\n\nThis heavily skews the bias toward Nvidia, but another factor is also at play.\n\nBoth stocks were undervalued entering 2023, but Supermicro's stock was unbelievably cheap at just over six times forward earnings. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThat's why Supermicro has outperformed Nvidia's stock over the past year, but that will likely stop soon. Now that Supermicro is more expensive than Nvidia, buying it doesn't make a ton of sense, especially if they're growing at the same pace.\n\nNvidia's business model is far superior because it controls the primary product, giving it an advantage when assessing profit margins. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNvidia is far more profitable than Supermicro, and if you give me a choice between two stocks that are evenly priced and growing around the same pace, then I'll choose the more profitable one every single time.\n\nWhile both companies will succeed as the AI buildout continues, I'm more excited about Nvidia due to its superior margins and control over the primary product. Super Micro Computer may be a solid company to invest in, but you're better off picking Nvidia at these prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: AMD Could Be Super Micro Computer's New Best Friend",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, has seen its stock skyrocket by 2,220% over the past three years. That stunning rally was fueled by the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which drove data center operators to purchase more of its high-performance AI servers.\n\nA lot of Supermicro's growth can be directly attributed to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which provides the high-end GPUs that process complex machine learning and AI tasks. Nvidia worked closely with Supermicro to design a new line of servers and workstations that fully supported its H100 GPUs, and that tight relationship enabled Supermicro to carve out a high-growth niche with its AI servers in the heavily commoditized market for pre-built servers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYet Supermicro's dependence on Nvidia is a double-edged sword. It struggled to secure a steady supply of Nvidia's GPUs in early 2023, and its two largest competitors -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies -- have also been working with Nvidia to design new AI servers. In its latest 10-K filing, Supermicro admitted that it doesn't hold any long-term agreements with Nvidia or its other suppliers that actually lock them in as exclusive partners.\n\nThat's why AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) recent expansion into the data center GPU market might be great news for Supermicro.\n\nWhy AMD could catch up to Nvidia in the AI race\n\nAMD only controlled about 17% of the discrete GPU market last year, according to Jon Peddie Research, putting it in a distant second place behind Nvidia with its 80% share. AMD's share mainly consists of gaming GPUs for PCs, but it has been expanding its reach into the data center market with its Instinct GPUs for processing AI tasks.\n\nAMD rolled out its first batch of Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017. It launched its newest MI300 Instinct GPUs, which are manufactured using TSMC's 5nm and 6nm process nodes, in late 2023. By several industry benchmarks, AMD's high-end MI300X actually beat Nvidia's H100 in terms of raw processing power and memory usage.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's a bright red flag for Nvidia, since the H100, which faces ongoing supply chain constraints, still costs about four times as much as the MI300. Nvidia claims the H100 still beats the MI300 when it's running optimized software, but that slight difference probably won't justify its premium price tag for cost-conscious data center operators.\n\nThat's why it wasn't surprising when AMD's CEO Lisa Su recently said the MI300 was on track to be the \"fastest revenue ramp of any product\" in the company's history. Su also estimates that AMD's Epyc CPUs have claimed 25% of the server CPU market at the expense of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) market-leading Xeons. Between the growth of those two businesses and the expansion of its programmable chip business (from Xilinx), AMD has more data center bundling options than Nvidia.\n\nCozying up to AMD\n\nSupermicro already works closely with AMD to design servers for its Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs. In November, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang predicted that AMD's MI300 GPUs, Nvidia's latest GPUs, and Intel's Gaudi AI accelerator chips would all \"gain broad adoption and expand our share in the accelerated compute market.\" In January, Liang predicted that ongoing diversification would \"more than double the size\" of the company's AI portfolio.\n\nIf Supermicro sells more AMD-powered AI servers, it could reduce its long-term dependence on Nvidia and insulate itself from any future supply chain constraints. Competitive pressure from AMD could also drive Nvidia to lower its GPU prices, which would boost Supermicro's gross margins by reducing its component costs.\n\nA well-balanced play on the AI market\n\nSupermicro already generates about half of its revenue from its AI servers, and Bank of America believes it could expand its share of the dedicated AI server market from 10% today to 17% over the next three years.\n\nThat's why analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 42% from its fiscal 2023 (which ended in June) through its fiscal 2026. That's a stunning growth rate for a stock that trades at just 3 times this year's sales.\n\nThat low valuation already makes Supermicro an attractive long-term play on the AI market, but its gradual diversification away from Nvidia with AMD-powered servers might make it a more balanced play on the AI market than either chipmaker.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

So here with more, we've got Nancy Tengler who is the CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments. Also here, we've got Steven Glass, Pella Funds Management Managing Director and Investment Analyst. Great to have you both here with us today.\n\nNancy, I want to begin with you because you are looking specifically at one of the best positioned companies. We'll start with the good. Then we'll get to the bad.\n\nBest position here, Amazon. Make the case for why Amazon even up against Meta and NVIDIA is the outperformer.\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Well, it's a game of relative performance from here. I think, I mean, clearly, NVIDIA is the winner. And will continue to win, I believe.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Amazon has yet to hit-- to retest its highs. And it's a company that has done improved efficiency, growing the advertising business. Cloud came in better than expected.\n\nAnd you have a CEO who is committed to taking the company to the next level. And so we think from here, you'll get really solid performance out of Amazon. And so we've moved it into our 12 best ideas portfolio and continue to hold it across our large cap equity strategies.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steve, I'm going to ask the same question to you in terms of who is best positioned. It looks like you think NVIDIA is. What do you see as the upside there just in terms of how much more gain is still in play?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, it's very difficult to actually have to have to force one to use their imagination. But the fact of the matter is this is a company on a 2% free cash flow yield, and it's only expected to grow 20% in 2015. So really its valuation fundamentals remain very strong. And it can continue growing here.\n\nI mean, Jensen Huang was commented on the size of the opportunity. It's bigger than everyone expected. It's a whole new industry. And it keeps on surprising. So in actual fact and royal valuation figures, it's actually one of the better positioned of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBRAD SMITH: All right, I want to get to one that, Nancy, you believe is worse position. And, Steve, I'm going to bring you in on this as well because I know you've got some commentary on their positioning.\n\nBut it's Google. It's Alphabet. Nancy, why is this the worst position to you?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: That's a great question, Brad. Because it should by its recent performance at least be teed up to outperform going forward. But they keep stumbling.\n\nSo this latest issue with the images, on Gemini is the second hiccup since they've announced generative AI. They are behind at least in the intellectual capturing war with Microsoft. And so I think you want to be dubious.\n\nUse weakness, maybe if you don't own the position to add to it or initiate it. But we are holding firm and not adding to our holdings. Because we think it's going to be a while before the company gets past these negative issues.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steven, do names that you see as worse position are Tesla and Apple? Tesla, I think, everyone can pretty much wrap their heads around just the fact that we've seen declining sales. The fact that margins have been under pressure. But why don't you see Apple turning it around anytime soon?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, the fact is that that's a fully penetrated market. I mean, obviously, we're depending on services now. And they are doing very well in services.\n\nBut they have to justify that market cap, they don't seem to have a large pipeline of new products coming through. And we're not suggesting for a moment that Apple is a bad business. It's just not growing, and it does not justify its valuation given its growth profile. One just has to accept that if they invest in Apple, they're going to get based on the current valuation and growth profile quite Meager returns.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What's going to unlock the next supercycle? Just to follow up on that, Steven.\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Supercycle for, which company?\n\nBRAD SMITH: For Apple. We often talk about an iPhone supercycle, whether or not generative AI is part of the smartphone or the handset is actually going to propel. A wave of new people to go trade in, trade up, and get whatever the new iPhone is. What from your perspective can drive it?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: That's unlikely. Because actually at the moment, the AI is happening in the cloud rather than at the edge. So it's not really a device, a personal device-driven market.\n\nAnd even if that was to happen, I mean, it's very well penetrated. So we're just swapping a current user for a new user. So then you've got to ask yourself, OK, can they expand their margins on the iPhone? Well, no.\n\nCan they grow more sales potentially? But then they've got the problems on the App Store. They rarely do in our view need to come out with a new product to justify their current valuation. They need some new growth vector.\n\nAnd we don't think it's going to be the headset. So it's based on what we can see right now. We can't see where that new growth vector is going to come from.\n\nAnd in actual fact, we actually think the App Store is at threat from this new-- from we see the regulation around the world, we see it in Europe, we've seen some in the US. And maybe it'll be more difficult for them to take their 30% cut on all app sales going forward.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Nancy, one of the names that we have not mentioned yet is Meta. And I bring that up given the outperformance that we saw last year. Given the fact that the stock is up just about nearly 190% over the past year.\n\nThey declared their first dividend last quarter on the earnings report. Obviously, lots of excitement there. Why isn't that one of your top names?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Yeah, well, we did own it, Seana. We owned it for many years. And we got out kind of in the high 300.\n\nAnd then we missed this last run. But we instead owned a name like Spotify in its place. And that's done extremely well also.\n\nI love the dividend. I think that there is an opportunity for Google potentially to announce a dividend. I mean, they certainly have enough free cash flow.\n\nBut I think Meta, for me, it's at this point, I'd rather jump into NVIDIA than into Meta because I think the model is not nearly as robust as NVIDIA's model is. And I would just point out that I think one of the things that's going to put a floor under all these stocks are share buybacks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven have announced about $190 billion in share buybacks. As the stock sell off, that the companies are going to step in and put a floor under it for investors.\n\nSo I think you can't go wrong owning any of them in my view. But I think our favorite right at this point is Amazon.\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Nancy and Steven, great to get your insight here, especially on names that we know so many of our viewers want to own, would like to own, or closely follow here when it comes to some of the trends that we're seeing in the broader market. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.",

This is Genesis-level creation.\n\nThis amount, if it were spun off as a single company, would be the 37th largest in the S&P 500 right now, ahead of Bank of America and Coca-Cola. If it were spun off into two companies, they would both be in the top 100, barely smaller than American Express, Siemens, and S&P Global.\n\nIf you bought all 41 of Forbes’ most valuable sports teams (a $256 billion grand total), you would be left with enough to also buy Warner Bros. Discovery with the leftover gains from Nvidia’s Thursday rally. You get the idea.\n\nOne question, of course, does follow all of this: What will Nvidia, after just taking fresh stakes in a few companies, do next?\n\nAs the third-largest company in the market right now behind only Microsoft and Apple, perhaps the answer isn’t hard to conjure. morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock: Headed to $1,100?",
        "content": "Benefiting from the current boom in artificial intelligence, semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was arguably the hottest stock on Wall Street in 2023. Even more impressive, it's off to an explosive start in 2024 as well. Helped by a big move higher this week, when the company reported a 265% year-over-year growth in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue, shares are now up more than 55% year to date as of this writing.\n\nBut here's the crazy thing: In response to Nvidia's better-than-expected quarterly results, well over a dozen analysts have raised their 12-month price targets for the growth stock to levels well beyond where shares are trading now. Indeed, several analysts have raised their price targets for the stock to levels of $1,000 or higher.\n\nLet's see what has some of the most bullish Nvidia analysts on Wall Street so upbeat.\n\nThe path to $1,000 and beyond\n\nOne of the most-cited reasons analysts are optimistic about Nvidia stock following its latest earnings report is management's guidance. The company said it expected fiscal first-quarter revenue of about $24 billion -- more than $2 billion more than what the consensus analyst forecast was.\n\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh raised his 12-month price target on the stock from $740 to $1,100. His optimism, like analysts at Bernstein and Benchmark (analysts who raised their price target for Nvidia shares to $1,000 after the earnings report), was based on the company's incredible momentum, shown by its explosive sales growth in fiscal Q4 and management's fiscal first-quarter guidance.\n\nFurther, Vinh praised the company's surging sales in its data center specifically. Data center revenue rose 27% sequentially and a whopping 409% year over year in fiscal Q4.\n\nIn the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for its data center products was coming from various industries. \"Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers -- demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies,\" Jensen explained. Even demand from auto, financial services, and healthcare industries \"are now at the multibillion-dollar level,\" he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia stock isn't for everyone\n\nCombining a staggeringly good fiscal fourth quarter with management's guidance for fiscal first-quarter revenue to increase by about $16.8 billion year over year, it's easy to see why analysts are upbeat about the stock. But does this mean investors should still be piling in at the stock's current price?\n\nSure, with Nvidia's earnings per share in fiscal 2024 soaring 586% to $11.93, the stock deserves to trade at a high valuation. Even more, the stock's current price-to-earnings multiple of 65 actually sounds quite reasonable for a stock with earnings growing this fast.\n\nDespite these factors providing some support for the stock's current valuation, there's one looming concern that should keep investors on their toes: Much of the demand for Nvidia's data center products is driven by surging interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Not only is this a new technology that is incredibly difficult to predict, but it's tough to know what sales trends surrounding it will look like after this initial demand boom moderates at some point in the future when the industry for these products matures.\n\nOn a similar note, competition in the space could prove more adept than expected. This wouldn't be the first time Wall Street underestimates competition. Few would have guessed 20 years ago that Intel would fall from grace and be surpassed in size by multiple competitors.\n\nBased on Nvidia's guidance for fiscal Q1 revenue and comments from management during the earnings call about some key products remaining supply constrained, there's no sign yet of a pullback in sales on the horizon. But this is a risk investors should be aware of.\n\nFor this reason, investors should tread carefully when reading about analysts' rosy 12-month price targets for the stock, opting to do their own due diligence and focus on the long term. Sure, maybe the stock is worth its current price tag. But it's OK to stay on the sidelines if you're unsure about the company's future. There are plenty of other stocks to consider.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Super Micro Computer Be Worth More Than Microsoft by 2050?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have both profited from the secular expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Supermicro develops high-end AI servers powered by Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) top-tier GPUs, while Microsoft weaves OpenAI's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nSupermicro went public at $8 per share with a valuation of $229 million in March 2007, but it now trades at about $750 a share with a market cap of $44 billion. That massive rally would have turned a $10,000 investment into more than $940,000. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSupermicro is still a lot smaller than Microsoft, which saw its market cap hit $3 trillion earlier this year, and smaller than its two larger competitors in the server market, Hewlett Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE) and Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL). But if Supermicro continues firing on all cylinders, could it grow into a multi-trillion-dollar AI giant like Microsoft by 2050?\n\nHow much larger could Supermicro grow?\n\nSupermicro is the world's third-largest server company with a market share of 5%, according to History-Computer. Dell leads the market with a 19% share, followed by HPE with a 13% share. Grand View Research expects the global server market to grow at a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nSupermicro differentiates itself from its slower-growth competitors by mainly producing high-performance servers instead of low- to mid-range servers. Its design partnership with Nvidia grants it access to its top-tier GPUs before other server makers, and that competitive edge enabled it to capitalize on the explosive growth of the generative AI market.\n\nSupermicro now generates roughly half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers powered by Nvidia's GPUs. Bank of America estimates that Supermicro already controls 10% of the dedicated AI server market -- and it expects its share to rise to 17% within the next three years as the entire niche market expands by 150%.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Supermicro have a realistic path toward $3 trillion?\n\nFrom fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2020 (which ended in June 2020), Supermicro's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%. Its revenue dipped 7% in fiscal 2021 as the pandemic disrupted the global server market, but surged 46% in fiscal 2022 and grew 37% in fiscal 2023 as the AI market's growth accelerated. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to continue rising at a CAGR of 42%.\n\nSupermicro still doesn't seem expensive right now at 3 times this year's sales. Assuming its price-to-sales ratio holds steady, its market cap could reach $61 billion by fiscal 2026 -- marking a near-40% gain from its current levels.\n\nBut to reach Microsoft's current market cap of $3 trillion by 2050 with the same price-to-sales ratio, Supermicro would need to generate $1 trillion in revenue. To reach that target, it would need to grow at a 24-year CAGR of 18% from fiscal 2026.\n\nThat might seem achievable relative to its previous growth rates, but Supermicro could face some unpredictable challenges before 2050. Nvidia could deepen its ties with Dell, HPE, and other server makers to drive the growth of the data center GPU market. The AI market could stall out after the next few economic downturns, and Supermicro could be revalued as a legacy server maker like HPE and Dell -- which both trade at less than 1 time this year's sales -- instead of as a hypergrowth stock.\n\nSimply put, Supermicro needs to keep hitting home runs over the next three decades to reach Microsoft's current market cap. But even if Supermicro somehow becomes a $3 trillion stock by 2050, Microsoft would likely be worth a lot more.\n\nFocus on more realistic targets\n\nSupermicro is still a great growth stock, but it's futile to compare a server maker to a diversified software giant like Microsoft -- which owns the world's top PC operating system (Windows), the most popular productivity software suite (Office), and the second-largest public cloud platform (Azure). Supermicro certainly has the potential to become a trillion-dollar stock over the next few decades if it plays its cards right, but I doubt it will ever come close to matching Microsoft's valuations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "David Tepper has developed quite a following on Wall Street. The billionaire heads up Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" by Forbes magazine and has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Over the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 17%, a remarkable accomplishment considering the macroeconomic downturn that plagued investors during 2022. Given his robust results, Tepper's stock picks might be worthy of additional review.\n\nAppaloosa's portfolio is heavily weighted toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with just five companies representing more than 46% of the fund's holdings to close out the fourth quarter:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 11.3% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 10.6% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 6.9% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 5.7%\n\nKeep in mind that hedge funds only report their holdings at the end of each quarter, and while these five stocks combined are largely unchanged compared to the third quarter, there's been a big shakeup among the holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms continues to be Tepper's top holding, largely unchanged since the prior quarter. The company's history of using AI to surface relevant content for users on its social media sites is well documented. Furthermore, as the world's second-largest digital advertising platform, Meta makes the lion's share of its revenue from targeted advertising -- which is more effective when assisted by AI.\n\nThe company isn't resting on its laurels, recently releasing a suite of AI-powered tools for its advertisers, designed to help better reach their desired audience. Furthermore, its LLaMA AI (Large Language Model Meta AI) has become one of the leading open-source AI models and can be found on each of the major cloud infrastructure platforms -- for a price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta gained 172% last year, so even as Tepper decreased his share count by 5%, the stock -- as a percentage of his portfolio -- is virtually unchanged.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nRecognizing the vast opportunity ahead, Microsoft was quick off the blocks to integrate generative AI capabilities into its widely used workplace productivity tools and cloud infrastructure platform.\n\nMicrosoft's AI assistant, Copilot, is the standard-bearer for these innovations. Users are rushing to adopt Copilot thanks to its ability to increase user productivity. Several analysts have suggested that Copilot could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027. Perhaps as importantly, Copilot is having a halo effect on Microsoft's Azure, which outgrew its cloud infrastructure rivals in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, management credited 6 percentage points of that growth to increasing demand for AI.\n\nTepper was likely impressed by the company's strong move in AI and market share gains in the cloud. This gave him an incentive to increase his Microsoft share count by 4%, bringing it to 11.3% of his portfolio. It probably doesn't hurt that it's only selling at a slight premium to the overall market -- a bargain for potential growth of this magnitude.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a trifecta of successful businesses, including its industry-leading e-commerce and cloud infrastructure operations, as well as the company's No. 3 digital advertising platform. Amazon has long been at the forefront of AI development, using these sophisticated algorithms to improve its operations, from making product recommendations to scheduling the most efficient delivery routes.\n\nMore recently, the company introduced Amazon Rufus, a digital shopping assistant designed to answer product questions, make comparisons, and make recommendations based on specified criteria. Furthermore, Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have access to all the latest generative AI models, which could reignite the company's cloud growth.\n\nTepper obviously sees additional upside, as he increased Appaloosa's holdings by 5%, bringing Amazon to 10.6% of its total portfolio. And at just 2 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a steal.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is arguably the poster child for the AI revolution, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard not only for gaming, but also for data centers, speeding information through the ether. Their unmatched computational horsepower has given the company a near monopoly on GPUs for both machine learning and data center use cases, with 95% of their respective markets. This supremacy gave the company a leg up in the generative AI market, which it has dominated from the outset.\n\nHowever, Tepper cut its stake in Nvidia by 23%, knocking it down to 6.9% of Appaloosa's holdings, from 8.8% in the third quarter. However, Nvidia stock jumped 239% last year, so Tepper likely took the opportunity to lock in some profits.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's Google Search acts as a funnel to fuel the company's industry-leading digital advertising business, which is also fueled by AI. The company was quick out of the gate to develop its generative AI functionality, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its Android and Google products. Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google is one of the \"Big Three\" cloud providers, giving it the perfect channel to sell AI products to its cloud customers.\n\nRecent developments include the debut of Gemini AI, which the company calls its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI continues to expand, providing access to 130 foundational AI models, with something to suit every need.\n\nFor all its potential, however, Appaloosa sold roughly 16% of its Alphabet holdings last quarter, bringing its stake to 5.7%, down from 7.2%. While Tepper hasn't addressed the move, it's likely he saw greater potential opportunities for Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "As Nvidia’s stock price soars above $788, market sage Rob Arnott has a warning for investors: ‘Disruptors are often disrupted’",
        "content": "For the worlds of finance and tech, Nvidia is now widely viewed an historic pioneer whose time has come, a colossus bound to dominate the artificial intelligence revolution en route to lifting the productivity and profitability of businesses worldwide to new heights. That's the message underscored by the astounding liftoff that on February 22, following its big-time earnings beat, boosted its market cap in a single day by 16% or $270 billion, and by mid-morning on February 23, added another 2% to hike its valuation to over $2 trillion.\n\nAmidst the widespread drumbeat of praise, skeptical voices are few. But we've heard many times before that the first mover in a change-the-world thrust forward will maintain its top position far into the future, only to witness the shooting stars get smothered by disruptors lured by the leader's rich profitability, and the industry's immense promise. So to get a perspective on the likelihood that Nvidia likely faces that fate, I asked two veterans who've seen super-hot innovators rise and fall to provide their take to Fortune.\n\nI put the question first to an expert who spans the worlds of academic finance and capital markets. Rob Arnott is founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, a firm that oversees investment strategies for $139 billion in mutual funds and ETFs. Arnott, alongside RA's CEO Chris Brightman, personally manages Pimco's $13 billion All Asset Fund. He's the father of \"fundamental indexing,\" an approach that weights companies in a portfolio by sales, net worth and other metrics measuring their size in the economy rather than by market cap, so that investors aren't trapped into putting more and more of their savings into the most expensive stocks. Arnott, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Financial Analysts Journal, oversees a group of PhDs at RA who conduct groundbreaking research, and consults regularly with the top minds at universities and business schools on ideas to refine RA's playbook.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's stock price forecast\n\nIn an email to Fortune, Arnott notes that the notion underpinning Nvidia's rise, that a single or even a couple of trailblazers that initially rule a new technology will maintain overwhelming leadership and deserve epic valuations, is another in a long series of \"big market delusions.\" He says that today's situation mirrors the early days in everything from hand-held devices to personal computers to eCommerce to laying pipes for The Internet. The AI frenzy, he declares, recalls such crazes as \"the dot.com bubble in 1999 and EVs in 2021.\"\n\nFor Arnott, when apparent breakthroughs first appeared and attracted strong investor backing you could usually count on three things: \"First, an exciting new industry is taking shape. Second, it will show impressive growth in the years ahead and probably change the world. Third, at the start, there's a handful of companies dominating this exciting new landscape.\"\n\nSo in most cases, the promise eventually paid off. But that doesn't mean those who led the way greatly profited over the years ahead. \"It was usually not true that first, the new technology brought on change nearly as rapid as the markets predicted,\" he says. \"And second, it was often not true that these will be the dominant players 5 or 10 or even 20 years in the future.\" Most of all, he adds, it's wrong to think that \"We can pay any price because these companies can achieve stupendous profits in due course. That's usually not true.\"\n\nArnott describes the herd mentality that's so swelled Nvidia's stock price as \"the classic nature of bubbles. Disruptors change the world in wonderful ways, but they cannot succeed unless their customers are succeeding even more than they are, and disruptors are often themselves disrupted.\" He points to Palm, dominant in handheld technology in 2000 losing out to BlackBerry in 2003, then BlackBerry losing to Apple's iPhone in 2008. Arnott's point is that competition eventually drives down a new industry's initially sterling profitability. The biggest beneficiaries are the customers that bank big productivity gains from advances in software or online advertising algorithms, and the sectors' enduring champs are the players that keep innovating so that their products help customers work faster, better and cheaper.\n\nArnott agrees that fast-growers such as Nvidia deserve \"premium valuations.\" But he argues that Nvidia's market cap is far, far too high versus the dollars it now generates in earnings. In his view, the risk Nvidia will follow so many others that have fallen from glory is much too great to justify its current PE (now at nearly 70). \"Nvidia's priced for perfection,\" he says. \"Its valuation leaves no room for shocks. Never short-sell bubble stocks when they're on a roll. But you don't have to own them, either.\"\n\nTop accountant Jack Ciesielski has seen too many early leaders fail to rate Nvidia a sure thing\n\nJack Ciesielski, former author of the Analyst's Accounting Observer, has long been one of the most astute commentators on trends in the financial markets. And he agrees with Arnott that the same forces that hammered the early winners in other great leaps forward could well stymie Nvidia. \"Remember what happened in word processing and early PCs,\" he says. \"First, you had the likes of WordPerfect, Ami Pro and Lotus, along with Commodore, Radio Shack and Eagle. But they lost, and the prizes went to Apple and Microsoft. It was the same in the early days of the internet. The companies that laid the cable such as UUNET and Lucent got big valuations, and are no longer with us. But those that thrived turned out to be the Amazons, Googles and companies that used the pipes.\"\n\nCiesielski observes that, \"It's not the first movers who usually win, it's the second movers\" who follow on with better strategies for winning customers and hatching the best new products. Plus, Nvidia is far from alone right now in minting AI software. Today, AMD and Intel are rolling out their own AI chips. As Arnott and Ciesielski both note, Nvidia's created a rage that all the software giants want ardently to join. Its takeoff is luring a herd of competitors set on winning their places as the princes or kings of AI. By attracting an onslaught, Nvidia's sorcerous success may be planting the seeds of its decline.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "OpenAI's Sora pours 'cold water' on China's AI dreams, as text-to-video advancements prompt more soul-searching",
        "content": "OpenAI's recent text-to-video model Sora has fired a fresh warning shot to China about its gap with the world's top artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, triggering questions about why the country has no equivalent product in an echo of the kind of soul-searching local researchers and investors went through after the 2022 launch of ChatGPT.\n\nJust a few years ago, China had envisioned itself eventually dominating the global AI race by leveraging the country's vast troves of data to develop mature applications for functions like facial recognition. Recent developments in generative AI - which uses large models to produce content like text, images and video - have changed the calculus, making China look like a laggard once again.\n\nSora, launched on February 16, moves the AI battle into the realm of video generation just as China is facing greater challenges from a lack of access to key tools such as advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) developed by Nvidia, the leading AI chip designer, owing to escalating US export restrictions. The country's best AI players are already a number of years behind their American peers in generative AI, an area in which Beijing's self-trumpeted internet governance model looks like a liability.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nZhou Hongyi, the founder of Chinese internet security firm 360 Security Technology, which has joined China's race to launch its own ChatGPT-style large language model, said the introduction of Sora was like a \"barrel of cold water poured down China's head\", Chinese media Yicai reported on Friday. \"It cools down the heads of many people, forcing us to see the gap with leaders overseas,\" he added.\n\nIn one knee-jerk response to Sora this week, Beijing asked its most trusted state-owned enterprises to take a lead on AI. The State Council's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission on Monday urged firms under direct control of the central government to \"embrace the profound changes brought about by AI\". Ten of these firms were designated as champions to promote AI, but the watchdog did not name the selected companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nXie Saining, an assistant professor of Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, denied he was involved in the development of Sora and emphasised the importance of talent, data and computing power. In a widely reported social media post, Xie asked whether China is ready for Sora, saying the country should make sure the technology \"won't be abused to serve as a profiteering and manipulation tool by some people or groups\".\n\nSora's access is currently limited. Unlike some of OpenAI's earlier models, it is not open source, and only a small number of people have access to a trial of the model.\n\nIn mainland China, the national Cyberspace Administration requires all publicly available large language models (LLMs) to be registered with the authority. OpenAI does not make its services directly available in the mainland or Hong Kong, nor does Google make its Gemini AI product available in those markets. Microsoft's Copilot, which uses OpenAI's GPT models, is available in Hong Kong.\n\nThe absence of foreign players in the mainland has left several local tech giants jostling for position in a crowded market of over 200 LLMs. Chinese search giant Baidu, social media behemoth Tencent Holdings, and e-commerce king Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the South China Morning Post, have all unveiled their own LLMs.\n\nFew are able to match Sora, however, partly because they are not yet using the novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture.\n\nByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, said its in-house video motion control tool Boximator, used to assist video generation, is still in infancy and not ready for mass release. \"It still has a big gap with leading video generation models in terms of image quality, fidelity and duration.\"\n\nRather than matching Sora, however, some industry insiders see the more pressing issue as gaining access to OpenAI's model. Beijing-based Sinodata said it will be one of the first companies to apply for a Sora API subscription once the text-to-video tool becomes available on Azure, the cloud computing platform of Microsoft, which is OpenAI's biggest backer.\n\nIn the US, though, lawmakers are already looking at ways of curbing China's access to American AI cloud services.\n\nMeanwhile, London-based unicorn Stability AI released its text-to-image model Stable Diffusion 3, which also uses DiT, as the architecture might become mainstream for building generative AI following the popularity of Sora. A Chinese developer, who declined to be named, said a likely path for Chinese AI engineers is to \"first decode Sora and train it with their own data to churn out a similar product\".\n\nXu Liang, an AI entrepreneur based in Hangzhou, eastern Zhejiang province, said it will not be long before China has similar services. \"As soon as in the next one or two months, there will be Sora-like models coming out of the Chinese market and plenty in the next half year,\" he said. But Xu noted that there could still be a non-negligible gap between Chinese products and Sora.\n\nWang Shuyi, a professor who focuses on AI and machine learning at Tianjin Normal University (TJNU), said the experience of developing LLMs in the past year has allowed the Chinese Big Tech firms to build up their know-how in this area and stock up on necessary hardware, giving them the ability to produce Sora-like products in the next six months.\n\nThe Sora launch has brought speculation about the secret behind its impressive output. Xie, at New York University and one of two developers of DiT, tweeted that \"data is likely the most critical factor for Sora's success\". He estimated that Sora might have around 3 billion parameters.\n\n\"If true, this is not an unreasonable model size,\" he wrote. \"It could suggest that training the Sora model might not require as many GPUs as one would anticipate - I would expect very fast iterations going forward.\"\n\nA few months before Sora was out, a group of researchers launched the VBench, a benchmarking tool for video generation models designed to evaluate performance of Runway's Gen-2 and Pika. Among 16 dimensions, Gen-2 stands out in areas including imaging quality and aesthetic quality, but it was weak in dynamic range and appearance style. Pika, co-founded by Chinese PhD candidate Guo Wenjing at Stanford University, is best at background consistency and temporal flickering but needs improvements in imaging quality.\n\nThe VBench team, consisting of researchers from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University and Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in China, found that Sora excels in overall video quality when compared with other models, based on the demos provided by OpenAI. There is limited information on how the model transforms text prompts into videos.\n\nBaidu chairman and CEO Robin Li Yanhong discusses the company's Ernie Bot during the Baidu World conference in Beijing on October 17, 2023.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nLu Yanxia, research director for IDC China's research on emerging technology, said tech giants such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent will be among the first to roll out similar services in the country. Local AI players iFlyTek, SenseTime and Hikvision - all sanctioned by Washington - will also be in the race, she said.\n\nBut China still faces an uphill battle, as the country's tech market becomes increasingly walled off from the world in terms of capital, hardware, data and even people, according to analysts.\n\nThe market value gap between China's top tech firms compared with those in the US such as Microsoft, Google and Nvidia has widened significantly in recent years since Beijing decided to kneecap its tech giants in the name of reining in the \"irrational expansion of capital\".\n\nAnd while China was once seen as having an advantage in its quantity of data, Lu said the country now faces a scarcity of quality data needed to train these newer models, compounding challenges from its limited access to advanced chips. A lack of talent is another concern, according to Lu, as the country's best and brightest in AI often find it easier to shine working for leading players in the US.\n\nAt OpenAI, for instance, tech professionals with an educational background from China form a key group. Among OpenAI's 1,677 associated members on LinkedIn, 23 of them studied at China's Tsinghua University, the ninth most common tertiary education institution among the start-up's employees, beating out the University of Cambridge and Yale University.\n\nStanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are the top three institutions among OpenAI workers, with 88, 80 and 59 employees, respectively, listing those schools on their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nEven with the requisite talent, though, experts question how far China's home-grown generative AI can go while facing existing constraints from US-China trade tensions.\n\nPing An Securities warned in a report that continued semiconductor export restrictions from the US \"may accelerate the maturity of the domestic AI chip industry\", but \"home-grown alternatives may fall short of expectations\".\n\nWashington has blocked Chinese companies from accessing the world's most advanced semiconductor tools through restrictions on related products that include any US-origin technology. In October, the US again tightened those restrictions, blocking the mainland's access to GPUs that Nvidia had specifically designed for Chinese clients in response to earlier curbs.\n\nAlexander Harrowell, principal analyst for advanced computing at technology research and advisory group Omdia, noted that China has options beyond GPUs for training LLMs. \"You could use Google's TPU [Tensor Processing Unit], Huawei's Ascend, AWS's Trainium, or one of quite a few start-ups' products,\" he said.\n\nBut replacing GPUs comes at a cost. \"The further you go from the GPU route, the more effort it will cost you in software development and systems administration,\" Harrowell said.\n\nThere will also be opportunities specifically for the China market, according to Xu, the Hangzhou-based entrepreneur. \"With the publication of the technical report on Sora, and upcoming open-source video models, there will be groundwork for the Chinese players to learn from,\" he said. Local video models will have better support for the Chinese language, he added.\n\nTJNU's Wang noted that one of the Sora demo videos involves a scene of a dancing Chinese dragon, which he found to be a stereotypical depiction of the activity. China's numerous ethnic groups, folk traditions, customs, and geographic diversity offer a wealth of material for local video models to draw from to better cater to local users, he said.\n\nWang also balked at the idea that there is an \"insurmountable divide\" between Chinese and American AI.\n\n\"Would Chinese companies rather just follow suit and crank out rip-offs every time their US peers come up with a novel product, or would they rather set a bigger goal to strive for safe artificial general intelligence?\" Wang asked.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Which \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Is Poised for the Most Spectacular Growth? Here's the Hands-Down Winner.",
        "content": "You can't spell growth without AI these days. I'm kidding, of course, but there's at least some truth in the tongue-in-cheek statement.\n\nAI provided a massive tailwind for the top growth stocks last year. These high-flying stocks are collectively known as the \"Magnificent Seven: Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. The momentum is continuing in 2024 for several of them.\n\nThe level of magnificence for these stocks varies, though. Which Magnificent Seven stock is poised for the most spectacular growth? Here's the hands-down winner -- at least over the next few years.\n\n\"The tipping point of a new computing era\"\n\nAll of the Magnificent Seven stocks could have tremendous long-term prospects. Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft should enjoy strong growth as organizations move to the cloud to run AI apps. Apple has opportunities in augmented reality, services, and more. Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet's Waymo unit, Amazon's Zoox, and potentially Apple could make a lot of money in the future with the advent of autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, one company stands head and shoulders above the rest. Nvidia made this fact abundantly clear with its latest quarterly update. It wasn't Nvidia's fourth-quarter numbers themselves, although they were great. Instead, it's what the company's executives said about the future.\n\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress set the tone early in the fourth-quarter call by stating, \"The world has reached the tipping point of a new computing era.\" She explained that this new era is due to the rapid transition to accelerated computing needed to power what Nvidia calls \"AI factories\" -- data centers specifically built for AI systems.\n\nSure, the rest of the Magnificent Seven companies will likely benefit from this new computing era, too. But nearly all of them use Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). At least for now, the only way they'll succeed in this new age is by fueling Nvidia's success.\n\nStory continues\n\nKress name-dropped several of the other six members of the Magnificent Seven in her comments. She noted that cloud providers such as Microsoft generated more than half of Nvidia's data center revenue in Q4.\n\nShe said that Nvidia is working with multiple leaders in large language models (LLMs), including Google and Microsoft (along with Microsoft's partner, OpenAI). Kress mentioned that Meta's use of AI (powered by Nvidia's GPUs) helped boost revenue in its latest quarter. She referred to a recent announcement that Amazon will use Nvidia DGX Cloud for its Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Although Kress didn't refer to Tesla by name, she did point out that the company is working to help several companies use AI in autonomous driving.\n\nHow much growth could Nvidia realistically deliver?\n\nNvidia expects that revenue for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 will be $24 billion. This amount reflects 234% year-over-year growth and nearly 9% sequential growth. But how much growth can Nvidia realistically deliver going forward?\n\nLike most companies, Nvidia doesn't provide details on its longer-term outlook. However, CEO Jensen Huang stated in the Q4 call, \"[F]undamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth in calendar '24 to calendar '25 and beyond.\" He cited two major trends as the reasons for his optimism.\n\nFirst, Huang echoed Kress' comments about the transition to accelerated computing. This opportunity is massive all by itself. Kress mentioned that the current installed base of data center infrastructure is valued at roughly $1 trillion. And most, if not all, of it is quickly migrating to accelerated computing.\n\nThe second trend that Huang referenced is generative AI. He maintained that \"a whole new industry is being formed\" because of generative AI, adding that it is driving Nvidia's growth.\n\nHuang believes that these two trends will cause the world's data center infrastructure installed base to double over the next five years. He predicted that the annual market opportunity from this explosion would be measured in \"the hundreds of billions\" of dollars. No company is better positioned to capitalize on this opportunity right now than Nvidia.\n\nWhat could get in the way?\n\nIt's possible, of course, that Huang and Kress are seeing Nvidia's future with rose-colored glasses and are way too optimistic about the future. If accelerated computing and generative AI don't deliver the tailwinds they expect, Nvidia's growth won't be as great as anticipated.\n\nNvidia's success is also attracting competition. Advanced Micro Devices, for example, argues that its newest AI chips are as good as Nvidia's. \"Magnificent Seven\" members Meta and Microsoft are two large customers that plan to use AMD's chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Several of Nvidia's big customers are developing their own AI chips as well.\n\nBefore Nvidia's blowout Q4 results, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned that supply could eventually exceed demand. While Kress stated in the quarterly call that even with supply increasing, the demand remains greater than supply. However, that could change down the road.\n\nFinally, Nvidia could deliver the massive sales growth that seems to be on the way, but its stock still underperforms. How? A tremendous amount of growth is already baked into Nvidia's share price.\n\nStill, the future for Nvidia appears to be very bright at this point. It arguably is the most magnificent of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SOXQ: This Low-Fee Semiconductor ETF Is Overlooked",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have unquestionably been the hottest part of the market, and the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXQ) is an excellent way for investors to play the semiconductor space. I’m bullish on this sometimes overlooked semiconductor ETF based on the strong historical performance of its underlying index, its highly-rated portfolio of top semiconductor stocks from across the semiconductor value chain, and its favorable expense ratio.\n\nWhat Is the SOXQ ETF’s Strategy?\n\nSOXQ is based on its underlying index, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index.\n\nAccording to Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), this index is “designed to measure the performance of the 30 largest U.S.-listed securities of companies engaged in the semiconductor business. Semiconductors include products such as memory chips, microprocessors, integrated circuits and related equipment that serve a wide variety of purposes in various types of electronics, including in personal household products, automobiles, and computers, among others.”\n\nSOXQ invests in “companies engaged in the design, distribution, manufacture and sale of semiconductors. The index is reconstituted annually (each September) and rebalanced on a quarterly basis.\n\nSOXQ’s Holdings\n\nAs discussed above, SOXQ holds 30 semiconductor stocks. Its top 10 holdings make up a relatively high 64.0% of assets. Below is an overview of SOXQ’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, SOXQ gives investors plenty of exposure to the company leading the generative AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has a weighting of 10.7% in the fund. It also gives investors plenty of exposure to the competitors trying to close the gap with Nvidia in this area, like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nAnother thing that I really like about SOXQ is that it invests across the semiconductor value chain, not just in chip developers like Nvidia and its peers. For example, within its top 10 holdings, SOXQ has positions in Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chipmaker, or foundry, which manufacturers chips for the likes of many of the other companies on this list like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fund also owns stocks like Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), which provide the equipment and machinery used in the semiconductor manufacturing process.\n\nI like that SOXQ invests in these companies, as they play pivotal roles in the semiconductor supply chain and because they enjoy significant moats around their businesses. Only a handful of companies in the world have the technological expertise to produce cutting-edge semiconductors or the complex machinery required to produce them.\n\nAll of these companies have posted strong performances over the past year. For instance, Lam Research is up 96.9%, Applied Materials is up 78.4%, ASML is up 50.4%, and Taiwan Semiconductor is up 45.5%.\n\nFurthermore, all of these stocks enjoy Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores from TipRanks. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Score, while Lam Research, Applied Materials, and ASML all have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. More broadly, an impressive nine out of SOXQ’s top 10 holdings enjoy Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or better.\n\nSOXQ itself comes in with an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nHistorical Performance of SOXQ’s Index\n\nSOXQ only launched in 2021, so it doesn’t yet have a very long track record of performance. The fund lost 35.6% in 2022, when the tech sector struggled, but came roaring back with a massive 66.7% gain in 2023 when advances in AI drove a tech sector rebound led by semiconductor stocks.\n\nHowever, luckily for us, SOXQ’s underlying index, the PHLX Semiconductor Index, has been around for a long time, giving us a basis to judge how SOXQ would have performed historically. As of January 31, the index has posted impressive returns of 15.4% on a three-year annualized basis, 29.3% on a five-year annualized basis, and 25.3% on a 10-year annualized basis.\n\nA Favorable Expense Ratio\n\nWith an expense ratio of just 0.19%, SOXQ is a cost-effective option for investors. This 0.19% expense ratio means that an investor will pay just $19 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nIn addition to being inexpensive in general, SOXQ’s expense ratio is also considerably lower than those of its peers. For example, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) all have identical expense ratios of 0.35%.\n\nSOXQ’s ratio is likely cheaper because it is newer and trying to compete with these ETFs, which works out in investors’ favor.\n\nHow much of a difference does this make over time? Assuming that the ETFs return 5% per year going forward and maintain their current expense ratios, an investor putting $10,000 into SOXQ would pay $243 in fees over the course of the next 10 years. Meanwhile, an investor putting $10,000 into any of the three larger ETFs would pay $443 in fees over the same period.\n\nAs you can see, while SOXQ is a smaller fund, it offers a more cost-effective way to invest in the semiconductor sector.\n\nIs SOXQ Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXQ earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SOXQ stock price target of $39.91 implies 9.8% upside potential.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe SOXQ ETF offers investors an excellent way to invest in the red-hot semiconductor sector. I’m bullish on SOXQ because it features a strong portfolio of highly-rated stocks across the semiconductor supply chain, from generative AI darling Nvidia to the companies making the chips and the equipment needed to make them.\n\nI’m also constructive on the relatively new ETF based on the strong historical performance of its underlying index and because it is one of the cheapest ways to broadly invest in the semiconductor space, with an expense ratio that is considerably lower than that of its peers.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\n(Reuters) - A staggering rise in shares of chipmaker Nvidia helped the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust become the first exchange traded fund to top $500 billion in assets, market participants said.\n\nThe largest and most liquid fund tracking the Standard & Poor's 500 index topped $500 billion on Thursday, according to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors. It currently has about $502 billion in assets.\n\nA sizeable chunk of those gains came from the surge in Nvidia, whose heavy weighting in the S&P 500 gives it an outsized influence on the index’s moves. The stock’s shares have soared nearly 60% year-to-date, adding another 8.9% in the last week alone, thanks to a post-earnings surge on Thursday.\n\n“This is a result of Nvidia climbing to new highs rather than of fresh demand for the ETF,” said Todd Rosenbluth, chief ETF strategist at VettaFi.\n\nNvidia, one of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks that have helped drive markets higher this year, has a weighting of 4.5% in the S&P 500. The index is up 6.7% year-to-date.\n\nThe company briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on an insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.\n\nWhile the SPDR ETF continues to dominate trading volumes and liquidity and topped the list of ETFs with the largest inflows last year, two other broad market ETFs have emerged as challengers in recent years.\n\nFlows into both BlackRock Inc.'s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF have grown at a faster rate over the last three years as a whole, data from LSEG showed.\n\nTogether, the three ETFs now account for about $1.35 trillion of the $8.4 trillion of total assets invested in ETFs in the U.S. Rosenbluth noted.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Ioseabshvili and David Gregorio)",

Investors worry valuations may be stretched after a rally that has lifted the S&P 500 more than 7% so far this year, but are optimistic about the profits companies may gain from artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We don't see that much more upside from current levels,\" said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York.\n\n\"But we have to acknowledge that over the last year we have been consistently positively surprised by the enormous profit growth for some of the AI-leveraged companies,\" Marcelli told Reuters, adding that better-than-expected inflation could prompt the Fed to cut more than expected.\n\nData that showed U.S. services sector growth picked up in January as new orders increased and employment rebounded to help equity markets advance, though a measure of input prices rising to an 11-month high added fodder to fears of sticky inflation.\n\nMSCI's all-country world index, a gauge of stock performance worldwide, closed up 0.1% after earlier hitting to a new intraday high.\n\nThe combination of strong growth and inflation not yet slowing to the Fed's 2% target has led Fed officials to push back on rate cut expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of the labor market has unequivocally emboldened the Fed to be more relaxed about keeping rates high for longer,\" said Dec Mullarkey, a managing director at SLC Management in Boston.\n\n\"So, the Fed is signaling it will be patient and use that runway to let more data roll in and cement the evidence that the economy is well balanced before they adjust rates,\" Mullarkey said.\n\nFed funds futures show a 52.6% chance of a cut in June, with a 35.5% probability of no cut, a sharp reversal from bets on Feb. 1 of a 62% chance of a cut in March, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.43% to post its fifth straight week of gains and a new closing high. The French CAC40 and German DAX indices also closed at record highs.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16% and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.03% gain as both posted new closing highs. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.28% but all three indices rose for the week, with the Dow up 1.3%, S&P 500 1.7% and the Nasdaq 1.4%.\n\nThe dollar was poised to record a weekly fall for the first time in 2024 as investors consolidated positions and sought further guidance on global economies.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.029%, with the euro down 0.03% to $1.082.\n\nOn the data front in Europe, German business morale fell unexpectedly in Europe's biggest economy in December, an Ifo institute survey showed.\n\nGerman bond yields were on track for their third straight weekly increase as the economic data and central bank officials continued to chip away at investors' hopes for rapid rate cuts by the European Central Bank this year.\n\nJapan's stock market was closed for a public holiday on Friday, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1%, suggesting Japanese stocks will extend their record run next week.\n\nChinese shares wobbled between gains and losses. The Shanghai Composite index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark. It is up 4.6% for the week and has bounced about 10% from five-year lows set more than two weeks ago.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.1%.\n\nData showed on Friday that China's new home prices fell for the seventh month in January, leaving sentiment fragile as policymakers' efforts to restore confidence in the debt-ridden sector struggled for traction.\n\nA Reuters poll showed that the recent rally in global stocks had a little further to go but they were divided on whether there would be a correction in the next three months.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 2.2 basis points to 4.692%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 7.5 basis points at 4.252%.\n\nThe 10-year hit a three-month high of 4.3540% overnight.\n\nU.S. crude futures settled down $2.12 to $76.49 a barrel and Brent fell $2.05 to settle at $81.62.\n\nGold prices were set for a weekly gain, buoyed by a softer dollar. U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $2,049.40 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Huw Jones, Stella Qiu; editing by Shri Navaratnam, Neil Fullick, Jane Merriman, Will Dunham and Mark Heinrich and Marguerita Choy)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For a lesson in the perils of being a skeptic on Wall Street when everyone else is a buyer, consider Rob Arnott, who made a sensible case five months ago that Nvidia Corp. had become a bubble.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Unveils Biggest Sanctions Package on Russia Since War Began Nvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales Bezos, Nvidia Join OpenAI in Funding Humanoid Robot Startup T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code Stock Rally Wanes After S&P 500 Touches 5,100 Mark: Markets Wrap\n\n“A textbook story of a Big Market Delusion” is how the venerable founder of Research Affiliates called it, citing extreme valuations after the shares quadrupled in just a year.\n\nSince his September warning, however, the ‘bubble’ has gotten around $800 billion bigger — and the greatest risk right now is getting left behind in its wake.\n\n“Never short-sell bubble stocks when they’re on a roll,” Arnott said this week. “But that doesn’t mean you have to own them.”\n\nWall Street isn’t deaf to the risks that gather when just a handful of high-valuation stocks dominate the market leader board, and Arnott’s view could ring true eventually. Yet after the world’s most valuable chipmaker smashed expectations with its blowout report Wednesday, the AI party is one nobody can afford to miss.\n\nShort interest is nearly nonexistent among tech behemoths. Analyst price targets are surging. Positioning from hedge funds to retail traders is getting more aggressive.\n\n“Right now, there’s no bear case,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at data platform Mapsignals. “You don’t get a move like this in a company this big if the bears have a leg to stand on.”\n\nFor active managers, the pressure is getting more intense by the day to ride the upward momentum across tech-powered indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, both of which just rose for the 15th time in 17 weeks. In turn, the Nasdaq 100’s price-earnings ratio climbed above 30 times and its multiple to sales reached 5, figures with few precedents outside the late 1990s dot-com craze and its aftermath.\n\nStory continues\n\nOwing both to the pace of earnings gains and the futility of betting against them, the Magnificent 7’s meteoric rally hasn’t been accompanied by any increase in bearish bets. Short interest has tumbled to just 1% of the group’s outstanding shares, hovering around the lowest level since at least 2015, according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Thursday’s 16% surge in Nvidia rung up about $3 billion in paper losses for those still holding bearish wagers, according to an analysis by S3 Partners LLC.\n\nAmong hedge funds, the latest 13F reports revealed another increase in the share of ownership of the group. Retail traders are also driving the action, with demand for bullish options reminiscent of the pandemic-era trading boom.\n\nYet even amid a record-breaking rally, Nvidia has seen its valuation narrow since the middle of 2023 thanks to its earnings growth.\n\n“It definitely was the most important stock on earth,” said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. tactical specialist Scott Rubner, speaking of Nvidia. “These market cap gains have brought back animal spirits to the retail traders with activity on the message boards and call options at the highest level since March 2020.”\n\nThe chipmaker reported a 486% year-over-year gain in earnings per share excluding certain items in its fiscal fourth quarter. The company also said it expects first quarter revenue of about $24 billion, handily beating analyst estimates.\n\nIn turn, bulls rushed to boost their price targets — the average is now about $863, implying a more than 9% upside, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the top end, Rosenblatt Securities boosted its target to a Street-high $1,400 from $1,100, more than 75% higher than were shares currently trade.\n\n“I’m actively looking for ways where Nvidia could go wrong and I’m having difficulty finding any real hole in the story,” said Shana Sissel, CEO at Banrion Capital Management LLC, who has been holding positions in Nvidia since 2017. “I wish I bought some at $650.”\n\nWhile Nvidia boosted major indexes, the gains were lavished in a select handful of equities yet again. Less than 70% of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange advanced, while S&P 500 cored a 1.7% weekly gain. That’s bad news for those who have been betting on a broadening of the rally soon enough.\n\nKen Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, is not worried about bloated valuations, but still cut exposure to the Nvidia to cash out on some of his gains.\n\n“Just to be prudent, we took about 20% off the table,” Mahoney said. “We also know that if in the days and weeks ahead if there’s a slowdown or the stock comes back a little bit, we will have some money to redeploy.”\n\n--With assistance from Isabelle Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?

Let's do a quick check of the markets here to cap out what has been an eventful week. The week of NVIDIA, you might say. The Dow and the S&P, any rise for them today is another record close. The NASDAQ 100 is the same. And so it looks like we got records once again. The NASDAQ not getting there though. In fact closing below 16,000 down about a quarter of 1%. We had utilities that were doing the best in today's session along with some other consumer staples stocks as well.\n\nIt looks like people getting a little rotating perhaps and a little defensive here. But as I mentioned earlier, it looks like you got to go all the way back before November. We've only had two negative weeks for the S&P 500 since that point in time, Josh.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And the major indexes notching another weekly gain and the S&P 500 just hanging on for a record finish. Jared Blikre is here with a look back at the action today and for the week. Jared.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: That's right, Josh. For all the talk about tech and NVIDIA, it was not the best week for tech overall and the tech heavy NASDAQ 100. The NASDAQ composite missing out on a record close once again haven't had one since November of '21. That's in the red for the and also for the week. Let's take a look at the 5-day totals here. And you can see actually in the green for 57 basis points.\n\nSo I stand corrected but check out the Russell 2000. This was sunk Tuesday and Wednesday. We had-- easy to forget, we had a nasty sell off earlier in the week. Russell is ending the week down 2.2% and the Dow which has been outperforming, that's up about 1%. So let's take a look at the sector action. Julie, you were talking about staples. We have indeed seen staples get some attention lately.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot necessarily today. Today it's utilities and materials. But let me show you the five-day totals here. Guess who the two winners are? Materials and staples. Boring old staples with Walmart, notching those blowout earnings earlier this week. And then healthcare and financials and industrials, all those outperforming. Financials, industrials, healthcare at record highs. If not today then yesterday. And it's really been a story this week, I think, about the broadening of the rally.\n\nAnd if you take a look at the leaders, you see a few here you haven't seen elsewhere. Homebuilders, that's XHB, that's at a record high. KWEB China bouncing back. Most definitely not at record highs, but they're gaining ground that they have lost. Korean stocks that's EWY up 2%. And then some others, IBB is biotech, that's another interesting one. But I want to take a look at the losers here.\n\nBecause I said it wasn't the greatest week for tech, it's really unprofitable tech. Our components down 6% for the ETF and we took a look at disruption a little bit earlier. Those were faltering. Then we take a look at TAN. That's a solar ETF that's down 11% very volatile. And IPOs in general have not been doing well at least in terms of that ETF. And let's take a look at software.\n\nBecause software for the week for the most part was in the red. You'll see more than 75% of these names closing down substantially. Adobe down they're down 6% on the left bottom all the way to Teladoc down 32% on the right. And a little bit of a different story for the semiconductors. Much more bullish looking than the software sector. Julie.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Thank you, Jared, very much.",

        "content": "The tech sector has been filled with corporations that outperform the market or do most of the heavy lifting for index funds. These companies invest in innovative technology and optimize their existing digital infrastructures.\n\nInvestors have made fortunes in this industry, and there’s plenty of additional upside if you have a lengthy time horizon. It’s possible to quadruple your returns if you buy reliable, growing companies instead of taking big risks. These are some of the tech stocks to consider for outsized returns.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is charging toward a $2 trillion market cap and is only behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in valuation. Strong momentum for the equity combined with strong financial growth suggests that Nvidia can surpass both of them within a few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has become a fan favorite in part due to its 214% over the past year. Shares have gained an even more impressive 1,733% over the past five years. Artificial intelligence has been a key growth driver that helped the company achieve 206% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24.\n\nNvidia also experienced meaningful growth in its gaming and professional visualization segments. Even the company’s automotive segment experienced year-over-year revenue growth although it didn’t contribute much to the company’s blockbuster quarter.\n\nIt’s nice to know that Nvidia has several business segments, and some of them are growing quickly. However, the main story for Nvidia is artificial intelligence. Investors don’t know when the AI boom will slow down, but as long as it stays strong, Nvidia stock should continue to surge.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit and debit cards have become economic staples. Many people prefer to pay with one of these cards to get rewards for every dollar they spend. The rewards add up, and a plastic card leaves more room in your wallet.\n\nStory continues\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a global technology company in the payments industry that has a large market share in credit and debit cards. Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V) are deeply ingrained within the industry. Families that use one of the issuer’s cards will recommend that card to their children, enabling cards to go from generation to generation.\n\nThis multigenerational advantage also comes with growing financials and healthy profit margins. Mastercard reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year net income growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fintech firm regularly posts net profit margins above 40%.\n\nMastercard initiates many buybacks to increase value for shareholders and distributes dividends each quarter. The firm spent $9.0 billion on stock repurchases and $534 million in dividends in 2023.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) wins people’s attention and knows how to optimize ad placements. This dynamic combination results in many businesses rushing to get their ads listed for important keywords. Once businesses use Google Ads and see good results, they continue to use these ads which means steady cash flow for Alphabet.\n\nThat formula has worked for quite a while, including in the most recent quarter. Alphabet closed out 2023 with 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 51.5% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nWhile Alphabet makes most of its revenue from advertisements, the company also has a profitable Cloud segment. Google Cloud is one of the top choices to store data and keep it safe from hackers.\n\nAlphabet is also primed to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. The company is using the technology to improve its search engines and cloud platform. These innovations can help Alphabet retain its market share and strengthen its financials.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and GOOG.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The dollar’s 2024 bull-run hit its first weekly setback after global growth and risk sentiment got a boost from blockbuster earnings by stock-market darling Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Unveils Biggest Sanctions Package on Russia Since War Began Nvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales Bezos, Nvidia Join OpenAI in Funding Humanoid Robot Startup T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code Stock Rally Wanes After S&P 500 Touches 5,100 Mark: Markets Wrap\n\nA Bloomberg gauge of the greenback has slid 0.1% since last Friday after rallying seven straight weeks in a 2.6% advance through Feb. 16. Treasury yields at year-to-date highs failed to ignite demand for the US currency as the ICE dollar index also dropped 0.3% this week, its worst performance in two months. Most G-10 currencies advanced.\n\nData that suggested a soft-landing for the American economy and better-than-expected growth outlook in Europe dented the appeal of traditional safe-haven currencies, weakening the dollar, franc and yen. Demand for riskier assets further weighed on the currencies as US, European and Japanese equity gauges hit all-time highs, propelled by a Nvidia-fueled rally that saw the stock top a $2 trillion valuation.\n\n“Greater growth stability outside the US would limit dollar gains and potentially set the backdrop for some pullbacks,”said Dominic Schnider, head of global foreign exchange and commodities at UBS Global Wealth Management in Switzerland. “Since economic data outside the US have room for further upside surprises, the impact of better US data could be mitigated,” he added.\n\nSchnider pointed to Thursday’s euro-area private-sector activity, which hit an eight-month high with the help of solid services expansion. The common currency advanced against the greenback for seven straight sessions through Thursday, its longest winning streak since July.\n\nChina’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, scheduled for release next week, could also bring some good news for global growth stability since “consensus expectations are undemanding at this point,” he noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors’ fervor for artificial intelligence and Nvidia in particular also weighed on safer currencies.\n\n“It is remarkable how the performance of a single company like Nvidia can resonate across various sectors and asset classes,” Charu Chanana, head of FX strategy at Saxo Markets wrote in a research note from Singapore Friday. “The enthusiasm generated by Nvidia’s performance has spilled over into the foreign exchange market as well, via the risk sentiment channel, pushing the risk-on currencies while weakening the risk-off ones.”\n\nAnd that bumpy ride might not be over yet. “Nvidia-mania looks set to extend,” according to Chanana.\n\nNonetheless, some Wall Street strategists see a higher near-term path for the greenback given a divergent growth outlook compared to other Group-of-10 nations.\n\n“Inflation is coming down faster than expected everywhere but weak growth in Europe, Japan and China will help provide moderate support for the dollar,” wrote MUFG strategists led by Derek Halpenny in a currency outlook released Wednesday.\n\nFor now traders are left to watch technical signals from US Treasuries, two-year yields will be key. Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at Jefferies said if rates on the shorter-dated bond go above their 200-day moving average that should limit the currency’s declines.\n\nEconomists are forecasting the dollar will fall below last year’s lows before 2024 is over.\n\n(Updates chart, prices throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?

        "content": "Investors have always searched for signs of bullishness in stocks that the market has discounted. The pursuit of value is never-ending. Those who can find bullish sleeper stocks among shares plagued by bearish sentiment stand to make a lot of money.\n\nTwo of the stocks discussed below are plagued by bullish sentiment. Each of those shares has plenty of positive catalysts, which suggest reasons for bullishness. The other stock is, or you’ll be the most important company now. Investors continue to wrestle with valuation concerns regarding that stock. Ultimately, I believe bullishness will prevail in its case.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock continues to be plagued by bearish sentiment that has lowered its stock price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce the darling of China’s Tech scene, the company has slipped of late. Other e-commerce firms from China have taken their place—namely, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). The company owns Temu, which continues to redefine Chinese e-commerce. Temu’s emergence provides yet another reason to be bearish on Alibaba. China is facing a period of deflation proving stickier than initially anticipated. That makes Alibaba particularly risky at the moment. However, many contrarians are beginning to bet on Alibaba at this time.\n\nMichael Burry, made famous in The Big Short, is among them. Alibaba currently represents the largest holding at Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm.\n\nYet, Burry’s opinion is just one of many. Investors looking for other reasons to bet on Alibaba should also consider that the company is the largest cloud provider in China. The company is analogous to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its composition, boasting a dominant cloud business. Cloud is one of the biggest areas of AI investment and potential, giving Alibaba an upside.\n\nMicron (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) is a chip stock that remains undervalued. The company is among the best-known providers of memory chips in the semiconductor conductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerally speaking, the chips that Micron provides are in high demand. They have applications across a number of important and growing markets. Memory chips are vitally important to the continued growth of the artificial intelligence and machine learning markets. Furthermore, Cloud computing, 5G and The Internet of Things (IoT) will require greater volumes of memory chips.\n\nYet, the semiconductor industry remains mired in a negative period of cyclicality. The semiconductor industry routinely undergoes boom and bust periods, resulting in rapidly shifting tides. The belief that Micron is a bull in bear’s clothing is somewhat of a contrarian opinion. The stock has much more upside than downside based on its current price. The fact that leading firms in the semiconductor industry are bullish about 2024, namely Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), may be enough for investors to establish a position.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s difficult to characterize Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a sleeper stock. Just about every investor is aware of its emergence over the past year.\n\nFurthermore, bearish investors cite valuation metrics such as its relatively high P/E ratio. Those Bears remain steadfast in their belief that Nvidia is overpriced. They use that notion to logically argue that share prices should move lower in the immediate future.\n\nI’ll make the same simple counterargument I’ve made several times regarding that idea: More than 11% of all semiconductor firms currently have a higher P/E ratio than Nvidia. One could easily argue that Nvidia is in the 99.99th percentile of all firms. Its valuation suggests that it is only trading in the 89th percentile. That poses a simple question: is Nvidia better or worse than 89% of its peer group? If you’re like me, you believe it is better and thus deserving of a higher price moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Apple was down 0.9% while Tesla fell 2%.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer, another beneficiary of the AI rally, dropped 12.4% after the server component maker priced its convertible notes.\n\n\"This is much more of puts and takes of what's been a very solid week and folks thinking about how they want to be positioned going out over the weekend,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Still he voiced optimism about the outlook for Nvidia and AI-related stocks.\n\n\"We are certainly continuing to get new evidence that artificial intelligence is going to drive a lot of excitement in equity markets. Clearly they (Nvidia) have more runway in front of them.\"\n\nAt 1:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 90.97 points, or 0.23%, at 39,160.08, and the S&P 500 had advanced 8.96 points, or 0.18%, at 5,095.99. The Nasdaq Composite was 3 points lower, or 0.02%, at 16,038.60.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow appeared headed for record closing highs again. Investors will also watch whether the Nasdaq can surpass the all-time high hit in November 2021.\n\nA majority of the S&P sectors were in positive territory. Among the best performers were utilities, which had been the sole laggard the previous day, as well as materials and industrials. All three climbed by more than 0.6%.\n\nCarvana surged 31.3% on reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery shed 9.3% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.\n\nJack Dorsey-led Block jumped 18.2% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.

        "title": "EVs Need The Power Of A.I And Customized Semiconductors To Reach The Finish Line",
        "content": "It’s a well-known fact that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is much more than an EV company. Moreover, it could even challenge the AI chip leader someday in the future. Despite its mind-blowing results, even the leadership of Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is threatened by the fact its clients such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) are running to make AI semiconductors in-house. The EV king, Tesla Inc is also among those who flexed its innovative muscle to make its customized A.I. chips in-house. Last year, Elon Musk stated that Tesla plans to spend $2 billion to build its A.I. supercomputer. Moreover, Morgan Stanley stated in September that with its new supercomputing power, Tesla could position itself as a strong rival even to Nvidia.\n\nEven the automotive accessory creator Worksport tapped into the semiconductor expertise.\n\nEarlier in February, Worksport revealed its partnership with Infineon Technologies (OTC: IFFNNF), a global designer and manufacturer of semiconductors and semiconductor-based solutions specialized in automotive and industrial end markets. Through this collaboration, Worksport aims to reduce the cost and weight of its portable power stations. By using Infineon’s GAN power semiconductors, Worksport will be able to boost the efficiency while lowering the weight, size and cost of its power converters used in its COR portable battery system. More precisely, Infineon’s technology will empower Worksport to lower the weight of its battery system by 33% and reduce system costs by up to 25%.\n\nWhile finalizing the COR battery system, Worksport is also preparing its power pal, the SOLIS solar-powered tonneau cover. The power-on-go duo promises to enhance the range of electric pickup and provide off-grid power. Today, Worksport also revealed its new distribution partner, Canada’s leading wholesaler of aftermarket truck products, Dix Performance North. Dix Performance North covers all major car and truck brands, including automotive giants like Ford Motor (NYSE: F), General Motors (NYSE: GM), Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM), Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA), and from now on, it will also include Worksport’s covers. Earlier this week, Worksport also revealed a version of its SOLIS solar cover will be available for the Ford F-150 Lightning. Although the electric version of its iconic pickup didn’t succeed to awaken the luster of its internal-combustion-engine counterpart, Worksport’s solar-powered tonneau cover could help Ford boost its appeal. Ford has been struggling on the EV front and scaling back its EV ambitions, but it has no doubt that EVs are here to stay so it definitely needs all the help it can get.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough Infineon that is banking in the AI boom, Worksport gained access to powerful breakthroughs on this revolutionary front.\n\nInfineon Technologies is heavily betting on the AI boom to boost their chip sales. Infineon CEO Jochen Hanebeck stated today that the company is positioned to generate billions in revenue and grow by selling higher price chips. For the 2024 fiscal year, Infineon expects to generate revenues in the low three-digit million euros range, while guiding for annual revenues of around one billion euros in a matter of few years. However, although Infineon posted record results for the 2022/2023 fiscal year, it also scaled back its targets for 2023/2024 due to a weakening macroeconomic outlook. But, despite its lowered guidance, the potential for lucrative semiconductor sales is undoubtedly there as both tech and EV companies need them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Eir Nolsøe reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nNew figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the fertility rate, which measures the average number of children a woman of childbearing age will have, dropped to 1.49 in 2022.\n\nThe number, which is the lowest in 83 years, comes amid an increasingly political debate about why women are having fewer children.\n\nMany politicians and economists fear that the economy will struggle to grow and living standards will stagnate or decline as the number of older people increases while fewer children are born.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:44 PM GMT\n\nRetailers launch last-ditch attempt to get Hunt to scrap tourist tax\n\nRetailers have launched a last-ditch effort to persuade Jeremy Hunt to scrap Britain’s tourist tax in the Budget with the most detailed evidence yet that removing it will spark a £3.8bn tourism boom. Szu Ping Chan and Hannah Boland report:\n\nThe Association of International Retail (AIR) and New West End Company, which represents retail businesses in London’s key shopping areas, submitted fresh evidence to Downing Street this week contradicting Treasury assumptions that reinstating VAT-free shopping will cost £2.5bn in foregone tax revenues.\n\nIts evidence, based on detailed spending data collected through its network of retailers, suggests that the amount of lost VAT will be just one fifth of the Treasury’s projection because EU visitors spend less money on shopping than on hotels, leisure and dining out.\n\nThe AIR notes that the Treasury’s original forecast was based on the assumption that tax-free shopping has little or no impact on how international travellers behave or where they decide to go on holiday.\n\nIts analysis shows that the cost of foregone VAT is likely to be closer to £525m based on how visitors from inside and outside the EU spend their money.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:13 PM GMT\n\nGermany businesses downbeat, key survey shows\n\nGermany’s businesses remain mired in pessimism, a key survey showed Friday, as Europe’s largest economy struggles with shortages of skilled labor, slower global trade, high interest rates and political squabbling.\n\nThe closely watched Ifo institute survey of business sentiment rose only slightly to 85.5 points in February from 85.2 points in January due to “slightly less pessimistic expectations,” the institute said in an accompanying statement.\n\n“The German economy is stabilising at a low level,” the institute said.\n\nThe survey results follow a sharp downgrade of the government’s expectations for growth this year, to only 0.2pc, from 1.3pc in the previous forecast.

Only club members can consume their product.\n\n“We have two goals: to crack down on the black market and improved protection of children and young people,” health minister Karl Lauterbach said at the start of a rowdy debate where the opposition accused him of promoting drug use.\n\nChristian Democrat legislator Tino Sorge said:\n\nYou are asserting in all seriousness that by legalising more drugs we will contain drug use among young people.\n\nThat is the most stupid thing I’ve ever heard.\n\nBut Lauterbach said that this amounted to “sticking our heads in the sand”: not only had cannabis use soared among young people, whose developing brains were particularly endangered, but drugs on the streets were both stronger and more impure nowadays, greatly increasing their harm.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nThe Chinese retail giant has written to Boohoo suppliers to see if they would be interested in striking a deal. In the email, first reported by Drapers, Shein said it was “looking for suitable suppliers around the world and also hope that your company is interested in cooperating with us”.\n\nIt went on: “According to preliminary understanding, your company has good experience in fashion, manufacturing and design. We would like to learn more about your company.”\n\nA Shein spokesman declined to comment on the supplier email.\n\nIt comes as Shein races to meet demand for its clothes as sales surge. UK sales rose above £1bn in the 16 months to December 2022, helping it make a £12.2m profit.\n\nThe retailer’s rapid rise has been driven by Gen Z shoppers on the hunt for cheaper versions of high street clothes. It sells dresses for less than £5 and jeans for under £7.\n\nShein is expected to hold a larger share of the UK clothing market than Zara within the next few years, with figures from GlobalData suggesting it currently accounts for 2.2pc of all sales. Boohoo’s market share has fallen from 1.13pc in 2020 to 0.86pc in 2022.

It is time our politicians made the right choices.\n\n07:19 AM GMT\n\nEnergy market still faces 'big issues,' says Ofgem boss\n\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said:\n\nThis is good news to see the price cap drop to its lowest level in more than two years – and to see energy bills for the average household drop by £690 since the peak of the crisis – but there are still big issues that we must tackle head-on to ensure we build a system that’s more resilient for the long term and fairer to customers.\n\nThat’s why we are levelising standing charges to end the inequity of people with prepayment meters, many of whom are vulnerable and struggling, being charged more up-front for their energy than other customers.\n\nWe also need to address the risk posed by stubbornly high levels of debt in the system, so we must introduce a temporary payment to help prevent an unsustainable situation leading to higher bills in the future. We’ll be stepping back to look at issues surrounding debt and affordability across market for struggling consumers, which we’ll be announcing soon.\n\nThese steps highlight the limitations of the current system – we can only move costs around – so we welcome news that the Government is opening the conversation on the future of price regulation, seeking views on how standard energy deals can be made more flexible so customers pay less if using electricity when prices are lower.\n\nBut longer term we need to think about what more can be done for those who simply cannot afford to pay their energy bills even as prices fall. As we return to something closer to normality we have an opportunity to reset and reframe the energy market to make sure it’s ready to protect customers if prices rise again.\n\n07:17 AM GMT\n\nEnergy suppliers allowed to charge extra to support struggling customers\n\nOfgem has also announced it will allow energy suppliers to temporarily charge an additional £28 per year to make sure they have sufficient funds to support customers who are struggling.\n\nThis will be added to the bills of customers who pay by direct debit or standard credit and is partly offset by the termination of an allowance worth £11 per year that covered debt costs related to the Covid pandemic.\n\nFurther changes mean direct debit customers will pay about £10 a year more, while those on prepayment meters will save about £49.\n\nOfgem has levelled all standing charges for customers on prepayment meters, meaning customers are not charged more depending on the payment method they use.\n\nSince October 2022 the so-called “prepayment meter premium” was removed by government support via the Energy Price Guarantee.\n\nHowever, with that support coming to an end on April 1, Ofgem has taken steps to provide a lasting solution, which must be funded by bill payers rather than tax payers, to maintain fairness in the system.\n\n07:05 AM GMT\n\nEnergy bills to fall by £238 a year\n\nHousehold energy bills will fall by an average of £238 a year from April under the latest limits imposed on suppliers by regulators.\n\nOfgem has revealed that its price cap will fall from its current rate of £1,928 a year for a typical dual-fuel household to £1,690 from April 1 - a drop of about £20 a month.\n\nThe changes will reduce typical energy bills by 12pc to their lowest level in two years - but it is less than analysts’ predictions of a fall to £1,656.\n\nIn 2022, the price cap for direct debit payers rose from £1,216 a year in January to £1,877 in April following the energy shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn October of that year it rose again to £3,371 and peaked at £4,059 in January 2023, although households were shielded from the full increases by the Government’s subsidies which capped bills at £2,500 a year.\n\nOfgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: “This is good news to see the price cap drop to its lowest level in more than two years – and to see energy bills for the average household drop by £690 since the peak of the crisis – but there are still big issues that we must tackle head-on to ensure we build a system that’s more resilient for the long term and fairer to customers.”\n\n07:02 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me. Ofgem has lowered its price cap on energy bills meaning households will save about £238 a year from April.\n\nThe energy regulator lowered its limit on what suppliers can charge from an average of £1,928 a year  to £1,690.\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Mercedes-Benz chief vows to build petrol cars ‘well into’ 2030s | German car giant waters down its targets for electric vehicle sales as demand slumps\n\n2) Rolls-Royce will build first mini-nuclear reactor in Europe instead of UK, boss warns | Engineering giant’s boss warns of consequences to Britain’s slow decision making\n\n3) How Japan shook off decades of stagnation – and beat stock market records | Benchmark boost fuels hopes of a much-anticipated economic comeback\n\n4) Thames Water crisis prompts warning that fines could trigger collapse | Rising debt levels risk landing taxpayers with multi-billion pound bailout bill\n\n5) Ben Marlow: Amoral Cadbury owner is giving cover to Putin’s war crimes | Mondelez’s flimsy stance on Russia has exposed the whole ESG edifice as an absurd, empty sham\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nAsian shares climbed following a day of record highs in Japanese, US and European markets fuelled by Nvidia’s mammoth results.\n\nShanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Wellington and Mumbai, as well as Bangkok, Manila and Kuala Lumpur all rose.\n\nJakarta and Singapore were down, while Hong Kong was flat.

        "content": "With so much focus on Nvidia (NVDA), investors may be missing out on some other spectacular plays for their portfolio. In addition, some analysts warn that it may not be a good idea to focus on one sector or stock too heavily.\n\nGLOBALT Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Keith Buchanan joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the broadening market rally and alternative stock plays for investors to add to their portfolio, other than Nvidia.\n\nBuchanan explains why one of his top picks is Walmart (WMT): \"Call me old fashioned, I like execution and that's what Walmart has proven time and time again. In the heart of the pandemic, coming out of the pandemic, they were able to keep prices ahead of inflation, now inflation is starting to turn down lower. The Vizio (VZIO) purchase... is really an example of where they see the corporation 10 years from now.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: The tech-fueled rally continues, although losing a little bit of steam today-- but Nvidia hitting a $2 trillion valuation and setting a record for the biggest daily market cap gain this week. And this comes after the chip-maker handily beat analysts' expectations in its earnings report and guidance.\n\nMarkets riding high on Nvidia's win, but the rally might need broader participation to survive. To break this down for us, Keith Buchanan, Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager is here. Good to have you on the show here. So, Keith, what is it going to take, then, to take some of the steam off of this rally that we're seeing and really broaden out some of the gains more?\n\nKEITH BUCHANAN: Thank you so much for having me. Really, AI is real as advertised. There's no denying that this is a revolutionary form of technology that will change every industry and how productive we are as a society. But just the sheer market cap that these corporations have garnered to this point is really hard to really fathom. I mean, there are two corporations that individually have more market cap than the entire Russell 2000 small cap index.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe feel like the market has become a little too top-heavy. We've enjoyed some of the gains of the Mag Seven, so to speak. And we don't feel like the valuation is extreme, even at these levels.\n\nBut we feel like this rally at this point is going to have to enjoy broader participation within value, within small cap, within mid cap in order to continue to sustain itself later into 2024. From a valuation standpoint we feel like that can benefit those corporations that execute very well, we saw some of that last quarter as far as earnings reports, especially guidance. And we're looking at those corporations for leadership going into 2024.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's interesting, because when you look at the price movement that we've seen and the valuations, a lot of people are wondering about that balance between rational exuberance and meme stock treatment here. So in terms of what could potentially let the steam out of this rally, what are you looking at?\n\nKEITH BUCHANAN: Look, irrational exuberance is when we make up different new ways to justify where things are. [INAUDIBLE] and price per click, price per book, in some areas, price per website visit in the '90s was a symptom of that exuberance. We're just not seeing it now. The most traditional earnings metric of price to earnings on a go-forward basis next 12 months-- Nvidia is trading at 30 times earnings. I mean, the market, S&P 500, is trading at 20 times.\n\nIt's trading cheaper than Chipotle, cheaper than Costco, cheaper than Amazon and Microsoft as well, and even half the valuation of a Tesla. We just don't feel like we have that exuberance just yet. And that's because the earnings expectations have actually outpaced the stock, if you can imagine that. So we don't feel like we're at excessive levels yet, we just feel like the broadening could help sustain this rally further into later into the year.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And, Keith, Nvidia's performance this week overshadowing all other stocks. But we did kick the week off talking about retail earnings. And you've got Walmart as one of your top picks. What do you like there?\n\nKEITH BUCHANAN: Call me old fashioned, I like execution. And that's what Walmart has proven time and time again. In the heart of the pandemic coming out of the pandemic, they were able to keep prices ahead of inflation. Now, the inflation is starting to turn down lower. The Vizio purchase, I think, really is an example of where they see the corporation 10 years from now.\n\nAmazon is-- I mean, Walmart is going through an Amazonification, if you will, of their business, as they're seeking different avenues to push advertising to online customers, as we saw more high earning customers come through their doors, the virtual doors, and actually get products through their e-commerce-- being able to push different advertisements to that new cohort of Walmart shoppers is really integral to where they grow the firm-- grow the company over the next 10 years. Vizio just plays a big role in how they-- a different channel to get those advertisements to those customers. We like the way Walmart is executing going into a future Walmart that could look a lot more like Amazon than Walmart of the past.",

The index was, however, close to its all-time high hit in November 2021.\n\n\"This is much more of puts and takes of what's been a very solid week and folks thinking about how they want to be positioned going out over the weekend,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.\n\nThat said, Hogan noted a bright outlook for Nvidia and AI-related stocks going ahead.\n\n\"We are certainly continuing to get new evidence that artificial intelligence is going to drive a lot of excitement in equity markets. Clearly they (Nvidia) have more runway in front of them.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128.80 points, or 0.33%, at 39,197.91, the S&P 500 was up 5.44 points, or 0.11%, at 5,093.08.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll the three major indexes were set for weekly gains after turbulence in the prior week when hotter-than-expected inflation data dampened expectations of early interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders firmed up bets against any U.S. interest-rate cuts before June after Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said he was in \"no rush\" to lower rates.\n\nAmong other stocks, Carvana surged 31.4% on reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery shed 11.3% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.\n\nJack Dorsey-led Block jumped 17.0% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 89 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 85 new highs and 109 new lows.

The Shanghai Composite index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark. It is up 4.6% for the week and has bounced about 10% from five-year lows set more than two weeks ago.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.1%.\n\nData showed on Friday that China's new home prices fell for the seventh month in January, leaving sentiment fragile as policymakers' efforts to restore confidence in the debt-ridden sector struggled for traction.\n\nA Reuters poll showed that the recent rally in global stocks had a little further to go but they were divided on whether there would be a correction in the next three months.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 2.2 basis points to 4.692%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 6.5 basis points at 4.262%.\n\nThe 10-year hit a three-month high of 4.3540% overnight.\n\nU.S. crude fell 1.68% to $77.29 per barrel and Brent was at $82.35, down 1.58% on the day.\n\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; editing by Shri Navaratnam, Neil Fullick, Jane Merriman and Mark Heinrich and Marguerita Choy)",

It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.\n\nNvidia's shares were trading more than 4% higher at a record high of $818 on Friday, maintaining its position as the third most valuable U.S. company. They have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023.\n\nThe chip designer's 2024 share jump has been crucial for the S&P 500's performance, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.\n\nIts latest market-beating forecast of a whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.\n\nThe breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.\n\n\"I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set.

        "title": "The Zen of Price",
        "content": "Growth and value are two fundamental approaches, or styles, in stock investing. Growth investors seek companies that offer strong earnings growth, while value investors seek stocks that appear to be undervalued and which they expect will return to fair value over time. Because the two styles complement each other, they can help add diversity to a portfolio when used together. When used together, some call the amalgamation \"growth at a reasonable price,\" or GARP. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has said the difference between value and growth investing is a false dichotomy. He wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 1993 annual letter:\n\n\"Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: 'value' and 'growth.' Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.\n\nBuffet's business partner, the late Charlie Munger, further summed this up when he said,\"Basically, all investment is value investment in the sense that you're always trying to get better prospects that you're paying for.\"\n\nThus, a primary goal for investors is to not to overpay for stocks, whether you are going for growth or going for value (or conversely, not to sell too cheaply if you are selling). This is a particularly acute problem for growth investors as they have a tendency to overpay for growth. On the other hand, the major problem for value investors is a tendency to buy value traps, which they think are cheap, but actually expensive because they do not account for a declining business. For every security, there is a \"stupid price zone\" and a \"smart price zone\" and a range of values in between. The idea is to buy at the \"smart\" zone and sell at the \"stupid\" zone. Another trap for investors is timing, meaning either buying or selling too early or too late. This is easier said than done, of course. That is why Munger calls investing simple, but not easy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet us start this meditation on price with granddaddy of valuation techniques, the venerable price-earnings ratio.\n\nPrice-earnings ratio\n\nThe price-earnings ratio is, of course, a simplistic measure as it merely the ratio of stock price to earnings per share. It itself gives no guidance as to what is an acceptable ratio. Many investors have developed rules of thumb to judge whether a price-earnings ratio is expensive or cheap. For example, they would use a multiple of 15, which they consider the long-term price-eanings ratio of the S&P 500 as the bright line separating cheap from expensive. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock is. The higher the ratio, the more expensive it is.\n\nThe practical problem is that often the price-earnings ratio is wrong. For cyclical stocks, often the best time to buy is when the ratio is very high or is zero (because earnings have evaporated). Look at the chart of price and price-earnings ratio for Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) (a classic cyclical stock) below. The Zen of Price\n\nGT Data by GuruFocus\n\nAnother big problem with the ratio is the earnings are based on GAAP earnings, which can fluctuate widely and may not reflect the true state of affairs of the earning power of the company. Take a look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) below. A great time to buy the stock would have been is 2019 when the price-earnings ratio was actually very high (the company had taken some non-cash write-offs at that time, which crashed the stock temporarily). Expected and unexpected events are contantly rocking the price-earnings line, making it a very unreliable measure. The Zen of Price\n\nPG Data by GuruFocus\n\nMedian PE and Shiller PE\n\nSome problems can be avoided by looking at the median price-earnings ratio over a period of time (say 10 years) and then deriving a \"fair price\" from this median. This technique would have got us into P&G in 2018-19, but we would have sold too soon in 2000 as the stock rebounded above the median price line. The Zen of Price\n\nPG Data by GuruFocus\n\nGuruFocus also provides the Shiller PE on its stock summary page, which is derived from the 10-year average of the inflation-adjusted earnings. Think of Shiller PE as a normalized price-earnings ratio that removes year-to-year distortions from the price-earnings line. In the chart below, the Shiller PE and price-earnings ratios are charted together with price. When the PE line is below the Shiller PE line, then chances are the stock may be undervalued (and vice versa).\n\nHowever, this signal is not very clear in the case of Goodyear as the company is very cyclical. Both the regular and Shiller PEs fluctuate widely. We could argue that it is a good time to go long when the regular price-earnings ratio hits an extreme level or goes to zero and then sell when it comes back to normal. The Zen of Price\n\nGT Data by GuruFocus\n\nFor Goodyear, the median price-earnings technique does not work as the line is too fickle. Further, the median price-sales line, while better, is too slow to have much predictive value. The Zen of Price\n\nGT Data by GuruFocus\n\nThe main point I want to make is that while price-earnngs may be a quick and useful metric with most stocks, it has to be used carefully. Many times it is absolutely misleading. Charting the ratio with its derivatives is helpful to discern if there is a valid valuation signal. Overall, I feel the price-earnings ratio is more often misleading and do not rely on it much.\n\nPEG ratio\n\nThen there is the PEG ratio, an old warhorse that incorporates growth. It was popularized by famous former fund manager Peter Lynch, who argued that a PEG ratio of 1 was a fair price, as he thought the earnings growth of a stock should ideally equal or exceed its price-earnings ratio.\n\nThe price-earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio, is a valuation measure that investors use to get a broad assessment of a company's performance and evaluate investment risk.\n\nPEG ratio is calculated as follows: PEG = PE ratio/Earnings growth over five years.\n\nIn theory, a PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Conversely, ratios lower than 1 are considered better, indicating a stock is undervalued.\n\nThere are two problems with the PEG ratio, however. One is price-earnings (the numerator) itself is problematic, which I have gone over already. The second problem is the denominator, or growth. Lynch used projected earnings growth, which requires judgement and is frequently wrong. Thus, the PEG is reduced to a judgement call.\n\nA popular, \"more objective\" number is to use past actual Ebitda growth. The problem, of course, is that this is backward-looking and assumes the past growth trajectory will continue in the future. I still lean toward the latter as there is no getting away from it, unless you want to get into the judgement game and plug in an estimated forward growth. For cyclical stocks like Goodyear, I would prefer to substitute one-year trailing 12-month Ebitda growth for the five-year growth as used for stocks like P&G.\n\nThe PEG ratio is more often wrong than right. Below is an annual chart showing price and PEG. As you can see, it is pretty much useless as a predictor of value or growth. (Note: chart below is annual numbers.) The Zen of Price\n\nGF Value\n\nThe GF Value chart is a proprietary measure which compares a company's current stock price to its GF Value Line. The GF Value Line is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus that is calculated based on the following factors:\n\nHistorical multiples (price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio and price-to-free cash flow) that the stock has traded at. A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth. Future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.\n\nExactly how the GF Value is calculated is not disclosed. While in my short experience it is a fine measure with good predictability, the lack of transparency of the calculation methodology prevents it from being used outside of GuruFocus.\n\nEarnings power value\n\nEarning power value, or EPV, is based on the concept first popularized by Columbia University professor Bruce Greenblatt that one should value a stock based on the current operating profits of company and not on future projections, which may or may not come true. Some argue it is a better though conservative way to analyze stocks than discounted cash flow analysis, which relies on highly speculative growth assumptions projected many years into the future. The main assumption for EPV is that the current profitability is sustainable. I find this method useful for assessing value stocks with little or no growth, but for stocks which rely on growth, it is pretty much useless.\n\nApplying the EPV method to Procter & Gamble and Goodyear, we find little if any predictive power for this method in valuing the two companies. This method would have prevented us from buying P&G over the last 25 years and given false results on Goodyear by indicating a buy in years when it would not have been prudent and a sell when the stock was undervalued. The Zen of Price\n\nPG Data by GuruFocus\n\nDiscounted cash flow method\n\nProbably the most popular method of valuation used by more sophisticated investors who have graduated from using price-earnings and PEG ratios, the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is a technique used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves discounting the projected cash flows (or earnings) back to their present value using a chosen discount rate, such as the weighted average cost of capital. The DCF method helps investors assess the potential profitability of an investment while accounting for the time value of money.\n\nDCF models can become quite complex, but this does not make them better. GuruFocus, for example offers a two-stage valuation model in its DCF calculator, which can use GAAP earnings or free cash flow as a starting point . The major input in GuruFocus' calculator is the choice of starting value, growth rates and discount rates. We will notice that small changes in assumption of these variables can have a big impact on the final valuation. Thus, investors get the results they want by playing around with the variables, which limits the usefulness of this technique. Too much skepticism and conservatism will make us miss opportunity and too much optimism will cause us to make mistakes. Errors are inevitable as we are projecting decades into the future. In the end, DCF, like other valuation techniques, is a tool and the utility of a tool depends on the skill we use it with. Just because we give an amateur a power saw does not make him into a carpenter. He can easily hurt himself.\n\nBelow is a valuation of Procter & Gamble using the default inputs. The model says the stock is very overvalued. I can, of course, play around with the model and get whatever value I want. Frankly, this becomes an exercise in self-justification. The Zen of Price\n\nProjected FCF\n\nAnother model which is available as part of GuruFocus' valuation panel is the projected free cash flow methodology. According to GuruFocus, since the DCF intrinsic value calculations are based on free cash flow or earnings, it cannot be applied to companies without consistent revenue and earnings. GuruFocus developed the projected FCF valuation model based on the normalized free cash flow and book value of the company. How it calculates the intrinsic value of stocks is described in detail here. Essentially, the method takes 80% of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years. So in essence, it's another variation of the DCF model. Looking at Procter & Gamble's valuation using this method, we see it appears to undervalue the stock. The Zen of Price\n\nThe same thing can be said for Goodyear's projected value. The Zen of Price\n\nI find the projected free cash flow is more useful in cases where company's business is capital intensive and cyclical and book value is a crucial component.\n\nSimple value and growth factors\n\nIn thinking about growth and value and my aversion to over-paying, I have been pondering on how to come up with a single measure which can incorporate both. How do you balance the two attributes and reconcile with the price of the stock?\n\nI devised a technique that I am sharing below. The technique involves reducing the value and growth attributes of the stock into a common scale which I call \"factors.\"\n\nThe technique has three steps. First, calculate the value factor. Second, calculate the growth factor. Third, add the value and growth factors together. The higher the total, the better. I will break these steps down further.\n\nFirst, derive the value factor by calculating the value of a stock with respect to a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. For instance:\n\nValue factor = Operating profits/ (enterprise value 10-year U.S. treasury bond rate)\n\nThe logic of the formula is as follows:\n\nNumerator: Operating profits are the pre-tax profits a company generates (for this exercise we ignore taxes). Denominator: The enterprise value is the logical value an external buyer would pay for the entire company on the open market. This includes market capitalization minus debt plus cash. Multiplying enterprise value by the 10-year treasury rate gives us the risk-free return an investor would get if was to invest the entire amount in 10-year U.S. treasury bonds.\n\nBasically, you want the operating profit of the company to be higher than the amount you would get if you were to invest the same amount in Treasuries, which are risk free. You obviously want to be paid more than the risk-free rate. The higher the factor, the better. Note this does not take into account growth of operating profit and enterprise value. Therefore, it is a conservative estimate. Here are some examples.\n\nLooking at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), at present you can get 13% better risk-free income from 10-year U.S. T-bills, while with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), you can get 116% more income as compared to the same bonds. This income is not the same as a dividend as a portion of this is retained earnings and also does not include taxes. Hot stock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is, of course, growing very fast and you may well decide the low factor of safety does not matter in the long run. But you are making this decision with eyes wide open. Same with Exxon (NYSE:XOM); while the factor of value is very high at present, it may be temporary given the high price of oil and it may well evaporate in the years to come.\n\nFor step two, the growth factor is calculated as the five-year Ebitda growth rate per share divided by the growth divider.\n\nBreaking it down further:\n\nNumerator: Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company's profitability and efficiency. Growing Ebitda is important for business owners and investors because it indicates an improvement in the company's performance and earnings per share. It also demonstrates the company's worth and attractiveness to potential investors. It also allows for a fair comparison of different companies with different capital structure, debt and tax profiles. Further, it separates revenue from other expenses and shows the core profitability of a business. It forms a middle ground between revenue growth and net income growth, so I find it more consistent and useful than either. The five-year period for Ebitda growth allows us sufficient time to get a consistent or secular growth number, though a shorter period might be more appropriate for cyclical businesses. For the purpose of this excercise, I will stick to five years. Denominator: Here this technique gets a little judgmental and arbitrary. I had to come up with a divisor which would give me a \"weight\" for each point of Ebitda growth. By trial and error, I found that a divider of 5 gives me decent results. Therefore, in this system, each five percentage points of Ebitda growth ( i.e., one growth factor) is equivalent to one value factor. Therefore, a company with a five-year Ebitda growth profile of 10% will give us a growth factor of 2 and so on.\n\nFor step three, we simply add the growth and value factors together to get a single number. The higher the number, the better.\n\nLet us start with the Nvidia, which is the stock du jour. The company's operating income for the trailing 12 months is $20.61 billion, while the current enterprise value is $1.34 trillion, the five-year Ebitda growth rate is 19.4%, 10-year Treasury yield is 3.94% and the growth divider is 5. Putting all this together, we get the following:\n\nValue factor = 20613/(1343984.2*3.94/100) = 0.3893\n\nGrowth factor = 19.4/5=3.88\n\nSum = 0.38+3.88=4.26\n\nTherefore, I find that Nvidia's growth factor is very high and more than makes up for the low value factor, making for a very good combined value and growth factor. This makes Nvidia a strong buy by this technique.\n\nThe following chart show Nvidia's value (blue bar), growth (red bar) and sum (combined, yellow line) factors over the last 10 years. The stock price is shown as a green line and plotted on the right vertical axis. Nvidia was showing signs of being a great buy as early as 2015, which became pretty clear by 2017 and the sum reached a peak in 2019, when the stock price was still quite low. Interestingly enough, the stock still looks like a buy with a combined factor value over 4, obviously because of its extraordinary growth. The Zen of Price\n\nHere is a similar chart for Microsoft, which also shows that it is still a buy (with a combined value and growth factor score of over 4) even after an epic run-up. The Zen of Price\n\nHere is a similar chart for Dominion (NYSE:D), a beaten down utility. While the combined factor is now over 1, it had very low growth factor. Overall, this is a hold, but is probably OK for value investors who are not looking for growth. The Zen of Price\n\nLumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) looks like a stock to avoid or sell. While the value factor is good, the growth factor is deeply negative. It looks like a melting icecube. At the very least, wait until the growth factor starts to reverse. The Zen of Price\n\nOverall, I find the simple value and growth factor method intuitive and reasonably predictable, as well as a useful addition to my valuation toolbox. It brings structure to the two most important attributes of price and helps seperate the signal from the noise.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many other valuation techniques such as the Graham number and enterprise value/Ebitda that are also of limited value in specific situations which I won't bother discussing.\n\nGiven the plethora of valuation techniques available, valuation is more of an art than a science. I think most experienced investors tend to use multiple techniques and then trigulate them to arrive at a value they think is fair and with which they feel comfortable. It is important to have a lattice work of mental models and be able to filter your ideas through them. Most of the ideas will be discarded and only a few remain.\n\nAs Munger said, What makes investment hard is that [on one hand] it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others, but [on the other hand] the price of the stock goes up so high that all of a sudden, the question of which stock is the best to buy gets quite difficult. We've never eliminated the difficulty of that problem.\n\nMunger and Buffett addressed this problem by practicing extreme patience in waiting for the right \"fat pitch.\" They are not afraid to let suboptimal pitches go by (in investing, unlike baseball, there is no compulsion to swing). However, when a fat pitch does arrive, they swing aggresively and decisively to hit the ball outside the park.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Can AMD Dethrone Nvidia as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powerhouse?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) development of high-end data center GPUs for processing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has turned it into a hypergrowth stock over the past couple of years. All of the world's leading AI companies -- including ChatGPT's developer OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Amazon -- use Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia's first-mover advantage and its lack of meaningful competitors made it one of the easiest ways to profit from the expansion of the AI market. But Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia's biggest competitor in the gaming GPU market, is also turning its gaze toward the AI market. Could AMD eventually dethrone Nvidia as the leader in AI chips? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe rivalry between AMD and Nvidia\n\nAMD entered the GPU market by acquiring ATI for $5.6 billion in 2006. It subsequently expanded ATI's Radeon brand to challenge Nvidia in discrete GPUs for gaming PCs, and it leveraged that technology to create APUs -- which bundle CPUs and GPUs on a single die -- for PCs and gaming consoles.\n\nAMD's main strategy against Nvidia, which mirrored its approach to challenging Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the CPU market, was to constantly sell chips that were cheaper than those of the market leader. AMD's GPUs could often provide gaming performance comparable to Nvidia's chips, but they usually consumed more power because they used less efficient designs.\n\nNvidia still controlled about 80% of the discrete GPU market last year, according to Jon Peddie Research, while AMD remained a distant second with a 17% share. The remaining small share belongs to Intel, which returned to the discrete GPU market in 2022.\n\nNvidia didn't make the same mistakes as Intel, which ceded a large portion of the PC CPU market to AMD through its own blunders over the past decade. Instead, Nvidia held AMD at bay with cheaper chips that targeted lower-end gamers.\n\nAMD's advantages in the AI market\n\nUnlike Intel, which manufactures most of its chips at its own foundries, AMD and Nvidia are both fabless chipmakers that outsource their production to the contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). As a result, their chip designs (in terms of size and power efficiency) are ultimately constrained by TSMC's technical limitations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose constraints might make it easier for AMD to catch up to Nvidia with comparable GPUs for data centers. AMD launched its first batch of Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, followed by more 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the subsequent years. AMD rolled out its newest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, in late 2023.\n\nIn the latest industry benchmarks, its top-tier MI300X actually beats Nvidia's H100 -- which is widely used for processing generative AI tasks -- in terms of raw processing power and memory bandwidth.\n\nMore importantly, data center operators can actually buy four MI300 GPUs for the price of a single H100 GPU -- which costs more than $40,000 as Nvidia struggles to deliver enough chips to meet demand.\n\nNvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software, but the massive price gap, the narrow performance gap, and the persistent supply chain constraints could drive more of its customers toward AMD.\n\nAMD is well-positioned to carve out its own niche\n\nTech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have already been testing or running Instinct GPUs as cost-efficient alternatives to Nvidia's chips.\n\nAMD also sells its Epyc server CPUs, which compete against Intel's Xeon CPUs, and programmable chips (through its acquisition of Xilinx). It can bundle those chips with its Instinct GPUs in cost-efficient packages for data centers.\n\nDuring AMD's fourth-quarter conference call in January, CEO Lisa Su said its MI300 deployments were \"accelerating\" and on track to be the \"fastest revenue ramp of any product\" in the company's history. Su also pointed out that AMD's combined sales of data center and embedded chips (including its Epyc, Instinct, Xilinx, and gaming APUs) grew by $1.2 billion in 2023 and accounted for over 50% of its full-year revenue.\n\nThose healthy growth rates suggest AMD can carve out a high-growth niche in the AI market. AMD's share of the global data-center CPU market already grew from 12% in 2021 to 20% in 2022, according to Counterpoint Research, and Lisa Su estimated that its share had risen to about 25% during an interview last year.\n\nBut can it actually dethrone Nvidia as the AI leader?\n\nAMD's Instinct business will likely expand over the next few years, but it probably won't overtake Nvidia as the market leader. Nvidia's prices should stabilize as it resolves its supply chain constraints, and many data center operators could use a mix of chips from the two rivals and their own first-party chipmaking divisions instead of dedicating themselves to a single vendor.\n\nTherefore, I believe AMD will carve out a high-growth niche in the AI market in the same way it expanded into the gaming GPU and data center GPU markets. But I don't think it will replace Nvidia as the AI kingpin.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nGlobal stocks captured by MSCI's all-country index surpassed 2022's peaks on Friday and soared to new records - leaving bonds unloved.\n\nAs the dust settles on another Nvidia-led AI feeding frenzy on Wall Street, interest rate markets have sulked back to mid-December settings - dragged there by the ebullience of the wider economy and a stubborn Federal Reserve.\n\nWith U.S. labor markets still in fine fettle, corporate profit growth in double digits and surging stocks loosening financial conditions again, rate futures now finally agree with what the Fed told them in December - only 75 basis points of rate cuts are likely this year and not starting until second half of 2024.\n\nKicking and screaming, bond markets have dialled back the clock to December too - with 2-year Treasury yields hitting their highest since December 11, just before the Fed meeting that month, and 10-year yields hitting the highest since November. The dollar was firmer.\n\nThe contrast with the stock market couldn't be starker, and it sees a breakdown in a long-running correlation of both asset classes - a return to normal patterns in some respects.\n\nSparked by Nvidia's latest blowout earnings report, its 15% stock surge and general excitement about a \"tipping point\" in generative artificial intelligence, Thursday was the best day in more than a year for Wall St's main stock indexes.\n\nThat catapulted the S&P500, Dow Jones back to record closing highs and the Nasdaq came within 1% of a new all-time peak too.\n\nWith annual profit growth of S&P500 companies through the fourth quarter now running at more than 10%, the main indexes are now up 6-7% for 2024 so far - and we're still in February.\n\nWorld stocks have followed suit, with Japan's Nikkei finally vaulting 1989 peaks on Thursday before taking Friday off for a holiday.\n\nMore subdued Chinese stock indexes eked out only another marginal gain - but they have now closed higher for nine sessions straight, lifted by some hopes the authorities were finally getting a grip on the property sector bust and spluttering economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe scale of the problem was clear in data showing China's new home prices continuing their downward trend with a drop of 0.3% in January, even though the pace of that decline slowed from the prior month and the biggest cities saw some stabilisation.\n\nExpecting further monetary stimulus ahead, ten-year Chinese government bond yields fell to 2.39% - the lowest since June 2002 - and the yuan weakened.\n\nIn Europe, German business morale brightened in February, in line with analysts' expectations. But it's badly needed as it was also confirmed that the German economy shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2023.\n\nIn banking, Standard Chartered's stock surged 8% after its results as chief executive Bill Winters acknowledged the bank's underwhelming share price and vowed to fix it as the lender announced increased dividends, a fresh $1 billion buyback and an 18% increase in annual profit.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller speaks * European Union and Eurogroup finance ministers meet in Ghent, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde * President of Argentina Javier Milei meets U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Buenos Aires * U.S. corp earnings: Warner Bros Discovery, Intuit\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures paused for breath on Friday after a stunning rally in the previous session, spurred by upbeat results from AI poster child Nvidia that renewed enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both surged to record closing highs on Thursday as investors piled into technology stocks as the AI-fueled frenzy on Wall Street gained more steam.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is about 1% away from its all-time high touched in November 2021.\n\nNvidia added $277 billion in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.\n\nShares of the heavyweight chip designer were up 2.1% in premarket trade on Friday and the company is closing in on $2 trillion in market value for the first time.\n\nMost other megacap stocks were subdued, with Tesla, Amazon.com and Apple down between 0.4% and 1%.\n\nAt 5:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 7 points, or 0.02%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 2 points, or 0.04%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 30.5 points, or 0.17%.\n\n\"Yesterday's rally was exceptional and now the markets are consolidating,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, but added that the AI-fueled momentum is expected to persist this year.\n\n\"Yes, the valuations are going high, but earnings are going high as well. So there is something really material and big happening right now as a fundamental support to the technology rally.\"\n\nCorporate earnings have been robust in the fourth quarter, with 78.5% of the 437 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far exceeding estimates, compared with the annual 76% average, according to LSEG data on Thursday.\n\nAll the three major indexes were set for weekly gains after turbulence in the prior week when hotter-than-expected inflation data dampened expectations of early interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nTraders firmed up bets against any U.S. interest-rate cuts before June after Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said he was in \"no rush\" to lower rates.\n\nAmong other stocks, Jack Dorsey-led Block surged 13.4% premarket after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "Forget FAANG and the \"Magnificent Seven.\"  Here Are 2 \"AI Five\" Stocks to Buy Right Now.",
        "content": "History is proof the U.S. stock market always climbs to new highs given enough time. But the stocks that lead the charge higher aren't always the same. To help find the new leaders, Wall Street often groups them together to separate them from the rest of the market. For example, CNBC financial analyst Jim Cramer coined the FAANG acronym in 2017 to describe five of the largest technology companies at the time:\n\nFacebook, which now trades as Meta Platforms Apple Amazon  Netflix  Google, which now trades as Alphabet\n\nThat leadership shifted in 2023 when a group of seven stocks drove the S&P 500 index to an annual return of twice its historical average. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett dubbed those stocks the \"Magnificent Seven,\" and they include:\n\nMeta Platforms Apple Amazon Alphabet Microsoft  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Tesla Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's time for the \"AI Five,\" according to one analyst\n\nWith Tesla stock sinking 22% so far this year, Jim Cramer thinks it should be booted from the Magnificent Seven entirely. The company is facing sluggish electric vehicle sales in 2024, which could keep a lid on its stock price and weaken the power of the Magnificent Seven as a group.\n\nIt prompted one analyst -- Glen Kacher from Light Street Capital -- to rethink the stock market's leadership altogether. He thinks investors should be focused on artificial intelligence (AI), so he has identified a new group of stocks and called it the \"AI Five.\" It includes:\n\nNvidia Microsoft Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO)\n\nEach company has a hand in developing the hardware and software necessary to bring AI to life. Here are two AI Five stocks investors should consider buying right now.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices might be one of the best semiconductor stocks to own in 2024. Its new MI300 data center chips are designed to process AI workloads, and they are shaping up to be the main rivals to Nvidia's industry-leading H100.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe MI300 comes in two configurations. The MI300X is a pure graphics processor (GPU) like the H100, whereas the MI300A combines GPU and central processing unit (CPU) hardware to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. The MI300A will power the El Capitan supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and it's expected to be the most powerful in the world when it comes online later this year.\n\nSome of the world's largest data center operators, companies like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Oracle, are also racing to get their hands on MI300 chips. They have relied almost entirely on Nvidia up until now, but supply constraints are pushing them to look for viable alternatives, and AMD is ready.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, AMD issued a bullish forecast for the MI300. The company originally expected the GPU to pull in $2 billion worth of sales in 2024, but it raised that number to $3.5 billion, much to the delight of investors.\n\nAI is also coming to personal computers, where users can process AI on-device for a faster experience, which reduces the reliance on external data centers. AMD's Ryzen AI series of neural processing units (NPUs) already power more than 50 notebook designs, and the company is working with Microsoft to develop a new version of Windows that will run AI workloads more efficiently.\n\nMillions of personal computers have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips, giving AMD a 90% market share in the segment. Ryzen AI drove the company's Client segment revenue to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, representing a whopping 62% year-over-year increase. AMD expects that momentum to continue, especially because it's preparing to launch a next-generation chip that could be more than three times faster.\n\nSimply put, 2024 is set to be incredibly exciting for AMD, and the company could be on the cusp of a multiyear growth cycle on the back of its new hardware slate.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nAs far as being an AI stock, Broadcom lives in the shadow of glamorous names like AMD and Nvidia. However, Broadcom is developing AI on multiple fronts, and its stock has delivered a 343% return over the last five years, so it definitely warrants some attention. Despite being founded in 1991, the company really took a leap forward when it merged with semiconductor giant Avago Technologies in 2016.\n\nBroadcom is now a conglomerate that not only includes Avago but also several acquired companies like semiconductor device supplier CA Technologies, cybersecurity giant Symantec, and cloud software developer VMware. Broadcom spent a whopping $98.6 billion on those three acquisitions since 2018.\n\nVMware, which had a price tag of $69 billion alone, is an increasingly important company in the context of the AI boom. Its software allows users to run virtual machines to distribute cloud infrastructure more efficiently. For example, one user on one server might only utilize 10% of its capacity, but virtual machines allow multiple users to plug into that server so it operates at capacity. Considering so many companies are racing to access AI data center infrastructure, optimization is one way they can squeeze the most value out of what they have.\n\nBroadcom itself is also considered a leader in networking and server connectivity solutions for the data center. It developed a high-bandwidth switch called Tomahawk 5, which is designed to accelerate AI and machine learning workloads. A switch regulates how fast data travels from one point to another, and considering developers are feeding billions of data points to powerful GPUs to train AI models, it has become an important piece of the infrastructure puzzle.\n\nBroadcom generated a record-high $35.8 billion in revenue during fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 29), which was an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2022. However, Broadcom's revenue is expected to grow by 40% in fiscal 2024 to $50 billion, thanks to the inclusion of VMware's financial results for the first time.\n\nBased on Broadcom's $42.25 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share in fiscal 2023 and its current stock price of $1,226.55, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.1. That's a 9% discount to the 32.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index, which implies Broadcom is still cheap relative to its peers in the tech sector.\n\nGiven the company's growing presence in AI through acquisitions and in-house development, Broadcom looks like a great AI Five stock to buy now and hold -- especially at this price.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Nvidia shares pop 16% after AI-fuelled bumper earnings (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nWall Street analysts have cheered Nvidia’s blowout earnings report with the median price target for the stock rising 19%.\n\nThe AI darling reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1bn (£17.4bn) for the quarter. The company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24bn.\n\n“The equity rally continued around the globe as Nvidia earnings sparked a wave of record highs. NVIDIA added $277bn in value, the most in market history, and brought its gains for the year to date to $740bn, taking its market capitalization to $1.94tn,” Jeremy Naylor, analyst at IG, said.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 live: Stocks continue to rally as Standard Chartered announces $1bn buyback\n\nThose shorting Nvidia stock were left nursing more than $2.9bn of paper losses, per data from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, Reuters reported.\n\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L)\n\nStandard Chartered has laid out plans to hand cash back to shareholders as it became the latest lender to reveal higher profits.\n\nThe Asia-focused bank launched a $1bn (£800m) share buyback and plans to return around $5bn (£4bn) to shareholders over the next three years.\n\nIt came as the company reported a pre-tax profit of $5.7bn (£4.5bn) for 2023, up 22% against the previous year.\n\nThe profit surge pushed the chief executive Bill Winters’ pay up 22% to £7.8m – from £6.4m in 2022. It is his largest pay package in nearly a decade.\n\nModerna (MRNA)\n\nShares of Moderna closed 13% higher Thursday after the company posted a surprise quarterly profit, boosted by deferred revenue and cost cuts.\n\nThe US biotech said revenues in the three months to December-end were $2.8bn, down on the $5.1bn recorded a year earlier but ahead of forecasts for $2.5bn.\n\nNet income slipped to $217m from $1.5bn, while diluted earnings per share came in at $0.55.\n\nWaning demand for COVID vaccines and anticipation of a loss for 2023 led to a steep decline in Moderna's shares last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nChief executive Stephane Bancel said: \"2023 was a year of transition for Moderna as we adapted to the endemic market.\n\nRead more: My first boss taught me the illustrative and commercial value of images\n\n“At the same time, our development team made significant pipeline advancements across infectious diseases, oncology and rare diseases, while our commercial team increased our COVID-19 market share in the US.”\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nWalmart investors are gearing up for a stock split at the end of this week.\n\nThe company’s 3-for-1 split means investors will receive an additional two shares for each one they already own. The move will increase the firm’s outstanding shares from 2.7 billion to about 8.1 billion.\n\nShares issued in the stock split will be payable after market close on Friday, 23 February, for investors who own shares of the retailer \"at the close of business\" on Thursday, 22 February. On Monday, 26 February, at market open, Walmart will begin trading on a post-split basis.\n\n“Sam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart.\n\n“Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come. As Sam said, ‘We’re all in this together. That’s the secret.\"\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Nvidia boom buoys stocks as Fed dampens rate-cut bets",
        "content": "(Updates at 0930 GMT)\n\nBy Huw Jones\n\nLONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Global shares firmed on Friday, capping a record breaking week after U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's blockbuster earnings energised tech stocks, powering key benchmarks across the world to new highs.\n\nBut oil prices were on track to snap a two-week winning streak after U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said interest rate cuts should be delayed at least two more months.\n\nThe prospect of rate cuts being pushed back underpinned the dollar, though the currency was on track to record a weekly fall for the first time in 2024 on Friday as investors took a breather\n\nThe tech sector was in the spotlight after Nvidia surged 16.4% overnight, adding a record $277 billion in market value.\n\nThe company's results supercharged a global AI-led rally in technology stocks, propelling the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, Europe's STOXX 600 and Japan's Nikkei share average to record highs.\n\nOn Friday, the MSCI All Country stock index was slightly firmer, just below its lifetime high on Thursday. The STOXX index was also firmer.\n\nWith the quarterly earnings season almost done, there is space for the market to continue trending higher, helped by a resilient U.S. economy, disinflation, chunks of cash parked in portfolios, and expectations of rates cuts at some point this year, said Kevin Thozet, investment committee member at Carmignac.\n\n\"I think these four elements provide a decent cocktail for financial markets. There is the question of whether there is a bubble in place or not, but when we look at valuations they are not bubbly,\" Thozet said.\n\n\"I would say concentration of returns - a very narrow market - is the main risk,\" Thozet added.\n\nOn the data front in Europe, German business morale fell unexpectedly in Europe's biggest economy in December, an Ifo institute survey showed.\n\n\"The German economy is stabilising at a low level,\" Ifo president Clemens Fuest said.\n\nStory continues\n\nGerman bond yields were on track for their third straight weekly increase on Friday as the economic data and central bank officials continued to chip away at investors' hopes for rapid interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank this year.\n\nAnalysts were also looking ahead to upcoming data next week.\n\n\"One argument that we think makes sense at this stage is that once the Nvidia effect has faded, equity markets are left with increasingly stretched valuations as US dollar rates continue to rise,\" analysts at ING bank said.\n\nNext week's U.S. personal consumption expenditures price index, dubbed the Fed's favourite inflation indicator, should be strong and push rate cut expectations further away, ING bank said.\n\nU.S. futures were slightly weaker.\n\nJULY FED CUT?\n\nJapan's stock market was closed for a public holiday on Friday, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1%, suggesting Japanese stocks will extend their record run next week.\n\nChinese shares wobbled between gains and losses. The Shanghai Composite index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark. It is up 4.6% for the week and has bounced about 10% from five-year lows set more than two weeks ago.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.1%.\n\nData showed on Friday that China's new home prices fell for the seventh month in January, leaving sentiment fragile as policymakers' efforts to restore confidence in the debt-ridden sector struggled for traction.\n\nA Reuters poll showed that the recent rally in global stocks had a little further to go but they were divided on whether there would be a correction in the next three months.\n\nThe first Fed cut is now fully priced in for July, and just 80 basis points of easing is reflect in this year's curve.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was firmer, trading at 4.348% after hitting a three-month high of 4.3540% overnight.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the yen was trading at 150.75 per dollar on Friday, above the 150 level seen as possibly drawing Japanese intervention to slow the currency's decline.\n\nThe Australian and kiwi dollars hit nine-year highs on the yen overnight, and were last fetching 98.83 and 93.23 yen.\n\nThe euro hovered at 163.10 yen, nearing a 15-year high of 164.30.\n\nOil prices fell after climbing on supply fears as hostilities in the Red Sea showed no signs of abating. A large build in U.S. crude inventories also weighed.\n\nBrent eased 1% to $82.77, while U.S. crude slipped 0.9% to $77.65 per barrel.\n\nThe spot gold price was down 0.35% at $2,017.\n\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Neil Fullick and Jane Merriman)",

Some examples include: • The inflection in GenAI: While a company like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a clear beneficiary of GenAI, as its hardware and software solutions are used to train and run GenAI models, we believe that GenAI has the potential to benefit many of our other businesses as well.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in fifth position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets were mostly higher on Friday after Nvidia delivered stunning results, setting off a rally in other technology companies that carried Wall Street to another record high.\n\nTokyo’s markets were closed for a holiday, a day after they surged to an all-time high.\n\nU.S. futures rose while oil prices fell back.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped less than 0.1% to 16,728.00 and the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 3,001.38.\n\nGovernment data on Wednesday showed few signs of recovery in China’s real estate market, as prices of new homes in first-tier cities fell 0.4% in January from a month earlier, extending a downward trend.\n\nThe property sector accounts for nearly a third of China's economic activity and the industry-wide meltdown has weighed on growth and sapped the confidence of both investors and consumers.\n\nMarkets were mostly higher elsewhere in Asia.\n\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.4% at 7,643.60, and the Kospi in Seoul added 0.2% to 2,670.40.\n\nIn India, the Sensex gained 0.2% and Bangkok's SET fell 0.2%.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 2.1% to 5,087.03, an all-time high. The Nasdaq rose 3% to 16,041.62.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has a smaller weighting in tech stocks, jumped 1.2%, to 39,069.11. That marks its first close above 39,000.\n\nNvidia’s stock price surged Thursday after delivering another blowout quarter, setting off a rally in other technology companies that carried Wall Street to another record high.\n\nThe chipmaker, which soared 16.4%, reported scorching demand for its semiconductors. Its stock has tripled over the past year thanks to a surge in investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Synopsis, which makes software used to test and develop chips, rose 6.9% after raising its profit forecast.\n\nOther chipmakers and companies involved in the chipmaking industry also gained ground. Advanced Micro Devices rose 10.7% and Lam Research added 4.7%.\n\nTechnology stocks have been the driving force behind the market’s rally that started in October. Solid earnings from some of the biggest names in the sector are helping justify and reinforce those gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street expects just under 4% growth for earnings in the overall S&P 500 during the fourth quarter. The communication services sector, which includes Google's parent Alphabet, is expected to report 45% growth. Information technology companies, which include Nvidia, are expected to notch 22% growth.\n\n“The near-term momentum in AI-related stocks is likely to continue,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nNearly 90% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings. There are still a few big names left to report over the next several weeks, including Lowe's, Dollar Tree and Best Buy.\n\nWall Street's focus on earnings this week follows economic data from the previous week that prompted a stumble in the market. Inflation data came in hotter than Wall Street expected, while retail sales fell more than anticipated. That raised concerns about the timing of hoped-for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nWall Street is now betting that the central bank will start trimming its benchmark rate in June, rather than March.\n\nInvestors could get more clarity on inflation next week when the government releases its monthly report on personal consumption and expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure. The Fed is trying to get inflation back down to its target of 2%. Analysts expect that report to show inflation cooled to 2.3% in January. It peaked at 7.1% in June of 2022.\n\nBond yields were relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.33% from 4.32% late Wednesday.\n\nIn energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 51 cents to $78.10 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 40 cents to $82.30 per barrel.\n\nThe U.S. dollar was trading at 150.65 Japanese yen, up slightly from 150.51 yen. The euro rose to $1.0831 from $1.0827.",

        "title": "Moderna Stock (NASDAQ:MRNA) at $100: Looking Past COVID-19 Vaccines for Profits",
        "content": "People depended on Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) in 2020 and 2021 for COVID-19 vaccines, but the pharma market landscape has changed dramatically since then. Now, Moderna has to demonstrate that it can evolve. Yet, the company’s latest quarterly report offers hope to frustrated shareholders. All in all, I am bullish on MRNA stock and envision a major turnaround story for 2024.\n\nModerna is a well-known drug and vaccine manufacturer. The company doesn’t only develop COVID-19 vaccines, of course. In actuality, Moderna’s mRNA technology can be applied to a variety of important medical use cases.\n\nThat’s all fine and well, but the market wants confirmation that Moderna is a financially viable business. As it turns out, there’s a fresh round of data to show that Moderna, while out of favor for a while, is a Big Pharma firm on the comeback trail.\n\nModerna’s Profitable Quarter Takes Investors by Surprise\n\nFebruary 22 was a good day for large-cap stocks generally, mainly because Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) published a blockbuster earnings report. Yet, that’s not the primary reason that MRNA stock flew 13.5% higher and broke above $100 before pulling back slightly.\n\nRather, the catalyst was Moderna’s financial report for the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2023. Moderna stock doesn’t normally move 13.5% in a single day, so clearly, there must have been something special in the company’s press release.\n\nIndeed, there were many special things to take note of. First of all, Moderna generated $2.8 billion in Q4-FY2023 revenue, while the consensus forecast only called for $2.5 billion in revenue.\n\nTo be fair and balanced, I must acknowledge that Moderna’s quarterly revenue declined 43% year-over-year, primarily due to a drop-off in COVID-19 vaccine sales. Consequently, Moderna will need to focus on other areas than COVID-19 vaccines, but we’ll get to that topic in a moment.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Moderna posted GAAP-measured net income of $217 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.55 per share. The unfortunate aspect of this result is that it’s a fall-off compared to the $3.61 per share that Moderna had earned in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, when we look at it through a different lens, we can see that Moderna did much better in Q4 FY2024 than the experts had anticipated. Wall Street had braced for Moderna to report a loss of $0.99 per share, so it was a nice surprise when the company actually reported positive earnings of $0.55 per share.\n\nModerna Moves Past Its “Year of Transition”\n\nSometimes, when corporate executives want to acknowledge a tough year in a press release, they’ll call it a “year of transition.” Indeed, that’s exactly how Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel described 2023.\n\nAgain, it’s been challenging for Moderna to commercialize COVID-19 vaccines in recent years. The company will continue to sell them, but fortunately, Moderna has other medical treatments in the pipeline.\n\nFor now, it looks like Moderna’s most promising proposed drug for 2024 will be mRNA-1345. That’s Moderna’s RSV vaccine, for which the company expects to get regulatory approval “starting in the first half of 2024.”\n\nThis could prove to be a substantial revenue generator for Moderna. In anticipation of the approval of mRNA-1345, Moderna’s management “is encouraged by early indications of widespread consumer awareness and established demand in the RSV market.”\n\nIn an interview, Bancel reiterated that 2023 was a “year of transition.” That year, Moderna “right-sized” its manufacturing and “took a big write-off.” So, the CEO isn’t afraid to admit that Moderna had some problems.\n\nIt’s a new year, and with that, Moderna can develop new treatments but also continue to market its COVID-19 vaccines. Bancel remains confident, assuring, “Now I think we’re off to the races. The objective this year … is to increase vaccination rates.”\n\nThat’s easier said than done, but again, Moderna isn’t wholly dependent on its COVID-19 vaccines. For Moderna’s RSV shot, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee predicted “a fairly smooth FDA approval.” In time, we’ll know whether this works out as Moderna’s management undoubtedly hopes it will.\n\nIs Moderna Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, MRNA comes in as a Moderate Buy based on seven Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Moderna stock price target is $131.38, implying 32.1% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MRNA stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Hartaj Singh of Oppenheimer, with an average return of 280.18% per rating and a 96% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider Moderna Stock?\n\nEven after a large single-day rally, Moderna stock still has plenty of overhead room to run further. It’s mainly a matter of whether Moderna can successfully commercialize its COVID-19 vaccines, RSV shot, and other treatments in the company’s pipeline.\n\nAt the very least, Moderna managed to deliver a surprise profit and a handy quarterly earnings beat. That’s commendable, so I’m feeling bullish about MRNA stock and will certainly consider it for a share position.\n\nDisclosure",

Equities in Taiwan rose as much as 0.9%, while South Korean stocks gained as much as 1.2%, after Nvidia on Wednesday forecast a roughly three-fold jump in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips. Malaysian stocks were marginally higher after the country's consumer price index in January rose 1.5% from a year earlier, below the 1.6% growth forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. A similar inflation trend was seen in Singapore where the key consumer price gauge rose 3.1% in January, lower than economists' forecasts but remained sticky amid slowing economic growth. Singapore shares were 1.4% lower, dragged by a 10.2% drop in casino firm Genting Singapore after its quarterly results took a hit on higher-than-expected depreciation. Inflation prints in Asian economies have shown easing trends, giving Asian central banks some breathing room, but the focus of investors remains on the timing of rate cuts. Earlier this week, the central banks of Indonesia and South Korea left their policy rates unchanged. However, \"the recent run of stronger-than-anticipated data threatens to delay rate cuts in the U.S., which could impact Asian policymakers’ decisions,\" said analysts at ANZ in a note. \"The ability and willingness of Asian central banks to pivot ahead of the U.S. Fed will depend on their external positions and the domestic pressure for cuts,\" they added. Currencies in the region were largely unchanged but headed for weekly declines. The Singapore dollar was flat and on track for its biggest weekly fall since the week of Dec. 29, 2023, while the Thai baht weakened 0.1% and was set to lose most in a week this month. The Malaysian ringgit hovered near a record low level after reaching a 26-year-low on Tuesday. The currency's plunge during the Asian financial crisis in 1998 led to then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad pegging the currency at 3.8 to the dollar, and the peg stayed until 2005.

        "content": "(Updates prices as of 0550 GMT, adds European, U.S. futures)\n\nBy Stella Qiu\n\nSYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Global stock markets are on course on Friday for a week of heady gains as AI darling Nvidia's stunning results sparked a wave of record highs from Asia to Europe and the U.S., while the yen nursed losses on a range of currencies.\n\nEuropean markets pointed to higher openings with EUROSTOXX 50 futures up 0.1% and FTSE futures gaining 0.2%. U.S. futures were mostly flat.\n\nNvidia surged 16.4% overnight, adding a record $277 billion in market value. The company's results supercharged a global AI-led rally in technology stocks, propelling the S&P 500 , the Dow Jones Industrials, Europe's STOXX 600 and Japan's Nikkei share average to record highs.\n\nJapan is closed for a public holiday on Friday, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1%, suggesting Japanese stocks will extend their record run next week.\n\nSome regional tech shares took a breather after a stellar rally this week, but MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan IT index still put on 0.3% to its highest level since March 2022.\n\nSouth Korea's Hynix, the world's second-biggest memory chipmaker which counts Nvidia (NVDA.O) as a key client, jumped 2.2% and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd rallied 1%. The Global X Asia semiconductor ETF was up 0.9%.\n\n\"The Nvidia effect has ripped through global equity markets and given fresh wind to markets that were looking ominously poised for a 3-5% drawdown,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone in Melbourne.\n\n\"Consider that Nvidia holds its highly anticipated GTC (technology) conference on 18 March – where they are likely to update the market on new products and innovations – so pullbacks in the stock should be shallow, and we could see buyers push price higher into that event,\" he said.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan pared early gains to be up 0.2% and was heading for a weekly gain of 1.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese shares wobbled between gains and losses. The Shanghai Composite index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark before retreating to trade 0.3% higher. It is up 4.6% for the week and has bounced about 10% from five-year lows set more than two weeks ago.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%.\n\nData showed on Friday that China's new home prices fell for the seventh month in January, leaving sentiment fragile as policymakers' efforts to restore confidence in the debt-ridden sector struggled for traction.\n\nShane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, said markets in general have been resilient even as global central banks pushed back against hopes for early rate cuts.\n\n\"I think the markets are sort of coming to the view 'well maybe we'll get the rate cuts'. They may not be as much as we thought, and they might be later, but if the economic activity is still good then that's not a problem.\"\n\nA Reuters poll showed that the recent rally in global stocks had a little further to go but they were divided on whether there would be a correction in the next three months.\n\nThe influential Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Thursday said policymakers should wait at least another couple of months to see if inflation was indeed heading back to target.\n\nRates markets continued to pare back U.S. policy easing expectations on the back of strong U.S. economic data. Jobless claims fell, home sales rose to a five-month high although the expansion in business activity slipped a little.\n\nThe first Fed cut is now fully priced in for July, and just 80 basis points of easing is reflect in this year's curve.\n\nThe cash Treasuries market is closed on Friday, but overnight, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to a three-month high of 4.3540%.\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, the yen was little changed at 150.59 per dollar on Friday, above the 150 level seen as possibly drawing Japanese intervention to slow the currency's decline.\n\nHowever, the yen has taken a beating against a broad range of currencies as investors bet the Bank of Japan will keep monetary policy accommodative even after ending negative interest rates.\n\nThe Australian and kiwi dollars hit nine-year highs on the yen overnight and were last fetching 98.89 and 93.33 yen. The euro hovered at 162.96 yen, nearing a 15-year high of 164.30.\n\nOil prices fell after climbing on supply fears as hostilities in the Red Sea showed no signs of abating. A large build in U.S. crude inventories also weighed.\n\nBrent eased 0.5% to $83.23, while U.S. crude slipped 0.6% to $78.17 per barrel.\n\nThe spot gold price was flat at $2,022.22.\n\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Neil Fullick)",

        "content": "Worldcoin (WLD) Hits New Highs as AI Coins Rally on the Back of Nvidia’s Earnings Surge\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman's brainchild, Worldcoin, is leading an AI-powered rally across the broader stock market. This week, Worldcoin's WLD token skyrocketed by 21%, reaching an all-time high of $8.96, and marking a staggering 300% gain in February alone.\n\nAt its core, Worldcoin aims to become a universal digital ID platform, using iris scans for verification and aspiring to grant everyone on the planet the ability to \"prove their humanity.\" This objective, however, has raised privacy concerns due to the reliance on iris-scanning devices.\n\nDespite the controversy, the Worldcoin project has gained traction, especially among young people and citizens in developing countries where the offered payment for registering identities translates to significant secondary income. This is evident in the surge of users to the World App, the project's first wallet, which surpassed 1 million daily users this week.\n\nThe excitement extends beyond Worldcoin, engulfing the broader AI token market. Notable projects like The Graph, Ocean, and Render Protocol have all witnessed over 50% gains in the last seven days. SingularityNET, another AI-focused token, has doubled in value.\n\nThis AI fervor has spilled over to the stock market, already buoyed by Nvidia's recent record earnings announcement. Nvidia's stock price has since climbed 16%, adding to its near 30% February increase and reaching an all-time high of $785. Tech giants like AMD, Microsoft, and Meta haven't been left behind, experiencing significant gains and flirting with their own all-time highs.\n\nThe renewed interest in AI is a major driving force behind the S&P 500's recovery since last year, with technology companies taking center stage in analyst discussions. Google Trends data further cements this fascination, revealing a surge in searches related to AI and its potential impact on both the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial landscape.",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee\n\nInvestors head to the weekend holding on to their risk-on hats as bourses across the world swell to all-time highs after AI darling Nvidia's blockbuster earnings revived a fiery rally in tech shares that may still rage on.\n\nThey will have a sprinkle of economic data from Germany to ponder on Friday, with European bourses due for a higher open, futures indicate.\n\nNvidia added an eye-watering $277 billion, or half a TSMC , to its market value on Thursday, with the optimism around AI taking the Nikkei, the STOXX 600 and the S&P 500 to record peaks on the same day.\n\nFriday is turning into more of the same, with Asian stocks at more than a six-month high, led by technology shares. Japan markets are closed for a holiday.\n\nTechnology shares in Europe have been on a tear, climbing 12.5% so far this year but with technical indicators flashing warnings of overheating, we may yet see some profit taking by investors in the near term.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600's relative strength index sits just below the 70 threshold that signals an overbought market.\n\nIn the currency market, the yen hogs the spotlight, sliding to fresh lows on the euro, sterling and other crosses this week. The yen is the worst-performing G10 currency this year, with a 6.4% slide on the dollar.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, is up 2.5% as traders come to the realisation that the Fed was perhaps not bluffing when it pushed back against early and steep expectations of interest rate cuts.\n\nGoldman Sachs was the latest to push back its starting point of the Fed's easing cycle to June from May.

The BSE Sensex rose 0.18% to 73,288.14 as of 10:24 a.m. IST.\n\nBoth indexes have gained about 1% in the week so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the more domestically-focussed small- and mid-caps added about 0.4% each.\n\n\"Indian equity markets will continue to do well due to underlying strength in the economy, acceleration of business activity, strong corporate profitability and sustained domestic inflows,\" said Pankaj Murarka, director and chief investment officer at Renaissance Investment Managers.\n\nNine of the 13 major sectors logged gains. IT stocks rose about 0.4%, extending gains for the second session and recouping a 3% drop in the first three sessions of the week.\n\nFinancial services, which shed 0.7% over the previous two sessions, climbed around 0.3%, shrugging off concerns over sustained growth and profitability in the sector.\n\nMeanwhile, oil and gas index lost 0.4% as oil marketing companies Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil Corp extended losses for the third session.\n\nConsumer goods stocks were down 0.25%, dragged by a 0.5% drop in ITC after smaller rival Prataap Snacks denied reports of negotiations for a stake sale.

        "title": "Nvidia H100: This Is the Chip Behind AI’s Supersonic Stock Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Computer components are not usually expected to transform entire businesses and industries, but a graphics processing unit Nvidia Corp. released in 2023 has done just that. The H100 data center chip has added more than $1 trillion to Nvidia’s value and turned the company into an AI kingmaker overnight. It’s shown investors that the buzz around generative artificial intelligence is translating into real revenue, at least for Nvidia and its most essential suppliers. Demand for the H100 is so great that some customers are having to wait as long as six months to receive it.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code Stocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets Wrap AT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network Expansion US Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private Spacecraft\n\n1. What is Nvidia’s H100 chip?\n\nThe H100, whose name is a nod to computer science pioneer Grace Hopper, is a graphics processor. It’s a beefier version of a type of chip that normally lives in PCs and helps gamers get the most realistic visual experience. But it’s been optimized to process vast volumes of data and computation at high speeds, making it a perfect fit for the power-intensive task of training AI models. Nvidia, founded in 1993, pioneered this market with investments dating back almost two decades, when it bet that the ability to do work in parallel would one day make its chips valuable in applications outside of gaming.\n\n2. Why is the H100 so special?\n\nGenerative AI platforms learn to complete tasks such as translating text, summarizing reports and synthesizing images by training on huge tomes of preexisting material. The more they see, the better they become at things like recognizing human speech or writing job cover letters. They develop through trial and error, making billions of attempts to achieve proficiency and sucking up huge amounts of computing power in the process. Nvidia says the H100 is four times faster than the chip’s predecessor, the A100, at training these so-called large language models, or LLMs, and is 30 times faster replying to user prompts. For companies racing to train LLMs to perform new tasks, that performance edge can be critical.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. How did Nvidia become a leader in AI?\n\nThe Santa Clara, California company is the world leader in graphics chips, the bits of a computer that generate the images you see on the screen. The most powerful of those are built with hundreds of processing cores that perform multiple simultaneous threads of computation, modeling complex physics like shadows and reflections. Nvidia’s engineers realized in the early 2000s that they could retool graphics accelerators for other applications, by dividing tasks up into smaller lumps and then working on them at the same time. Just over a decade ago, AI researchers discovered that their work could finally be made practical by using this type of chip.\n\n4. Does Nvidia have any real competitors?\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the market for accelerators in the AI data centers operated by Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Cloud and Microsoft Corp.’s Azure. Those companies’ in-house efforts to build their own chips, and rival products from chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp., haven’t made much of an impression on the AI accelerator market so far.\n\n5. How does Nvidia stay ahead of its competitors?\n\nNvidia has rapidly updated its offerings, including software to support the hardware, at a pace that no other firm has yet been able to match. The company has also devised various cluster systems that help its customers buy H100s in bulk and deploy them quickly. Chips like Intel’s Xeon processors are capable of more complex data crunching, but they have fewer cores and are much slower at working through the mountains of information typically used to train AI software. Nvidia’s data center division posted an 81% increase in revenue to $22 billion in the final quarter of 2023.\n\n6. How do AMD and Intel compare to Nvidia?\n\nAMD, the second-largest maker of computer graphics chips, unveiled a version of its Instinct line in June aimed at the market that Nvidia’s products dominate. The chip, called MI300X, has more memory to handle workloads for generative AI, AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su told the audience at an event in San Francisco. “We are still very, very early in the life cycle of AI,” she said in December. Intel is bringing specific chips for AI workloads to the market but acknowledged that, for now, demand for data center graphics chips is growing faster than for the processor units that were traditionally its strength. Nvidia’s advantage isn’t just in the performance of its hardware. The company invented something called CUDA, a language for its graphics chips that allows them to be programmed for the type of work that underpins AI programs.\n\n7. What is Nvidia planning on releasing next?\n\nLater this year, the H100 will pass the torch to a successor, the H200, before Nvidia makes more substantial changes to the design with a B100 model further down the road. CEO Jensen Huang has acted as an ambassador for the technology and sought to get governments, as well as private enterprise, to buy early or risk being left behind by those who embrace AI. Nvidia also knows that once customers choose its technology for their generative AI projects, it’ll have a much easier time selling them upgrades than competitors hoping to draw users away.\n\nFill any gaps in your knowledge with our glossary of AI terms to know Britain’s Alan Turing Institute considers the ethics and safety of AI Bloomberg Businessweek probes the back story of Jensen Huang’s big bet on AI AI is helping accelerate drug development, giving rise to a new class of “techbio” firms\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA24’s Risky Hollywood Moment Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market How Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Earnings season continues to wind down, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. The period has been primarily positive, with results from the Technology sector keeping market sentiment in check.\n\nConversely, Energy results have weighed on the overall earnings picture. Nonetheless, one of the most highly-awaited quarterly releases was delivered yesterday after the bell – NVIDIA’s NVDA Q4 and FY24 results.\n\nThe stock has been on a tear over the last year thanks to the AI frenzy, with shares up more than 230% during the period. Investors took its quarterly print in stride, pushing shares higher post-earnings. Let’s take a closer look at a few key metrics from the release.\n\nNVIDIA Q4\n\nThe company delivered Q4 revenue of a record $22.1 billion, up 27% sequentially and a sizable 409% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP EPS totaled $5.16, climbing 28% sequentially and 485% from the year-ago period.\n\nBoth items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, penciling in beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nData Center\n\nOf course, Data Center was the real highlight of the release, which included sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in $18.4 billion (yet again, another quarterly record) throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nThe reported figure handily beat our consensus estimate of $16.9 billion by nearly 9% (or $1.4 billion). It reflected the company’s fourth consecutive release of posting better-than-expected Data Center results, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nJensen Huang, CEO, on the results: “Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,”.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming revenue growth was also robust, with quarterly revenue of $2.9 billion 56% higher year-over-year. It’s also worth noting that the company launched its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs throughout the period, with generative AI capabilities for over 100 million RTX AI PCs also announced.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilar to Data Center results, the reported figure exceeded our consensus estimate by 7% (or $186 million), continuing a recent streak of better-than-expected Gaming results. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nIt was another robust quarter for market-favorite NVIDIA NVDA, with the company continuing to enjoy robust growth stemming from AI demand. Unsurprisingly, shares jumped following the release, reflecting investors’ positive sentiment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late Wednesday.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips. The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nHuawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago.\n\nAnalysts have estimated China's AI chip market to be worth $7 billion.\n\nLast year, Reuters reported that Chinese search giant Baidu placed a chip order with Huawei ahead of widely anticipated new rules by the U.S. government tightened restrictions on advanced AI chips exported to China.\n\nOther rivals pointed out by Nvidia include Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and Qualcomm. The chip company also identified several large cloud computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft\n\nNvidia shares surged 14% in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that topped consensus estimates as strong demand for AI continues.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Asian Shares to Climb as Equities Hit Record Highs: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks are set to gain Friday, fueled by the global rally in equities that’s seen share markets from the US to Europe and Japan hit all-time highs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales Stocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets Wrap T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code AT&T Says Mobile Network Restored as US Starts Investigation Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024\n\nAustralian shares opened higher, while futures pointed to gains in China. Japanese markets are closed Friday for a public holiday. The bullish mood continued on Wall Street overnight, with a buoyant outlook for Nvidia Corp., the most valuable chipmaker, helping it surge 16% amid artificial-intelligence mania, while fresh data showed the world’s largest economy is still going strong.\n\nNvidia’s $277 billion one-day boost to its market capitalization on Thursday was the biggest single-session increase in value ever — eclipsing a $197 billion gain made by Meta Platforms Inc. With the numbers now in, bulls are calculating Nvidia’s new price-to-earnings ratio, or how much investors are paying for future growth. Put another way, the firm’s profits have been growing faster than its shares.\n\n“Nvidia got to where it is because of extremely strong earnings and revenue,” said James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. “When a company posts 265% year-over-year revenue growth — like Nvidia did — it deserves a premium valuation.”\n\nWhile most Asian markets are likely to end the week by following Wall Street’s lead higher, in China concern is lingering over an economic slowdown that’s starting to look entrenched. There’s no signs of a pick-up in the struggling housing market, with data published Thursday showing the number of foreclosed properties for sale in China rose at a faster pace in January.\n\nThe MSCI ACWI Index of both developed and emerging-market shares rose to its highest level ever Thursday while the Nasdaq 100 added 3% and the S&P 500 saw its biggest gain since January 2023. The $16 billion VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 6.8%. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc. — two other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth — rallied to records. Super Micro Computer Inc., which has become a darling for investors wanting exposure to the revolutionary technology, soared 33%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquities were also buoyed by solid manufacturing, housing and labor-market data, with traders taking more hawkish Fedspeak in stride. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.32%.\n\n“Few things are more certain than death, taxes, and Nvidia beats on earnings,” said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. “The bar was set quite high, and incredibly they’ve once again stepped up and hit a home run.”\n\nNvidia’s market capitalization has now increased by more than $700 billion this year — with its value now topping $1.9 trillion — as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\n\nCompanies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are Nvidia’s largest customers — accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, — as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\n\n“Demand for AI is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” said Tom Hulick at Strategy Asset Managers. “We own NVDA and continue to hold the company. This is an exciting momentum play that we have been promoting and participating with for a few years now.”\n\nDemmert at Main Street Research says that for investors who already own Nvidia, the recommendation would be to hold the stock and avoid selling in order to capture future expected growth “as we are still early in this transformative AI technology.”\n\n“For investors who don’t own the stock, we would be buying on any weakness,” he noted. “With Nvidia’s stock, there will be corrections and bumps along the way, but the stock will continue to climb the wall of worry.”\n\nThe tech rally has propelled the valuation of the Nasdaq 100 to an elevated level versus history, with a similar picture for the S&P 500. Lofty valuations could ultimately curb more gains as investors weigh how much they’re willing to pay for stocks valued on future growth.\n\nStill, Citigroup Inc. strategist Scott Chronert said recently that index price-to-earnings readings could be misleading because 40% of the S&P 500 trades off other metrics. He predicted that more stocks could re-rate even with the US benchmark trading at 20 times forward earnings — which is exactly what followed.\n\nMeantime, demand for options protecting against a short-term pullback in the Nasdaq 100 is easing after nearing the highest level in months before Nvidia’s earnings report.\n\nThe implied volatility premium for one-month puts over calls — known as the skew — on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF had increased to about 3.5 points this week, a level last seen for any length of time back in November. The concerns were focused in the market for short-term options, with the difference between one-month and three-month skews reaching the narrowest level since April 2022 before widening back out.\n\nIn commodities, oil fell snapping two sessions of gains. Gold fluctuated after the US economic data and Federal Reserve minutes which indicated policymakers are content with leaving rates higher for longer if needed.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nAT&T Inc. said its mobile network has been restored after a widespread, hours-long outage Thursday as the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security began investigating why hundreds of thousands of wireless subscribers lost service. Reddit Inc. filed for an initial public offering, confirming its revenue growth and helping to propel a still tenuous resurgence in US listings. AbbVie Inc. is selling around $15 billion of bonds in the US investment-grade market on Thursday to help fund its acquisitions of ImmunoGen Inc. and Cerevel Therapeutics Holdings Inc., adding to a recent rush of buyout financings. Space exploration startup Intuitive Machines Inc. will attempt on Thursday to put the first intact, US-made lander on the moon in more than 50 years. Rivian Automotive Inc., an electric-vehicle maker, issued a disappointing production forecast and announced another round of job cuts. Moderna Inc. reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat analysts’ expectations by gaining Covid vaccine market share on its rival, Pfizer Inc. Newmont Corp., the world’s top gold producer, will sell six mines and two projects in a set of divestitures aimed at generating $2 billion in cash. Grab Holdings Ltd., a ride-hailing company, forecast 2024 revenue below analysts’ estimates, suggesting a deeper-than-anticipated slowdown in its core online business.\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\nChina property prices, Friday Germany IFO business climate, GDP, Friday ECB publishes 1- and 3-Year inflation expectations survey, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures were little changed as of 8:07 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.6% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0824 The Japanese yen was little changed at 150.48 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2023 per dollar The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6558\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 0.6% to $51,364.01 Ether rose 0.1% to $2,988.82\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.32% Japan’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.715% Australia’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.16%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.4% to $78.31 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA24’s Risky Hollywood Moment Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market How Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Fear is your friend, and embrace your failures: Leadership advice from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the company shatters a new record",
        "content": "Nvidia is having quite a week.\n\nThe tech company, which specializes in making chips used for AI, added more than $277 billion in market value on Thursday, beating the record for single-day market gains previously held by Meta. The surge followed company earnings on Wednesday, in which Nvidia beat analyst expectations and reported revenues of around $22.1 billion last quarter. It is now the third most valuable company in the U.S., behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang wrote this week. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.”\n\nBut the chipmaker poised to become the most important company in the world has humble beginnings—it was born in a Denny’s restaurant—and its path to success has not been linear. Here are some key leadership lessons from Nvidia and Huang, who embraces fear as a motivator, collaborates with his top managers, and reminds his workers that the company is never more than a month away from shutting down.\n\nStick to your guns\n\nIn navigating the uncertainty of the tech industry, Huang bet on a specific kind of technology—GPUs.\n\nThat stands for graphics processing unit, which was previously considered a niche technology and mostly used by gamers. Now, it’s critical to AI, with one analyst likening the AI boom to a war, and calling Nvidia the “only arms dealer out there.”\n\nBut Huang bet on GPUs years before it was clear to everyone else that it would pay off, and stuck to that decision through bad times and good. “What he did was recognize that even though there was boom and bust around the GPU, that eventually if there were enough use cases of it, they would offset each other,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told Fortune.\n\n“What sets Jensen apart is he’s a wartime CEO,” Munster added. Even when Nvidia is out of favor with investor consensus, and facing near-term setbacks, the company stays “true to [its] view of the future.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIgnorance is bliss\n\nHuang has openly said that if he knew how hard it would be to create and maintain his company, he probably wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be, than any of us expected it to be,” Huang said last year on the Acquired podcast.\n\nHe added that ignorance wasn’t just important for him personally—it’s an important quality for all founders.\n\n“I think that’s kind of the superpower of an entrepreneur. They don’t know how hard it is. And they only ask themselves: ‘How hard can it be?’ To this day, I trick my brain into thinking: ‘How hard can it be?’” he said.\n\nFear is a powerful motivator\n\nNvidia had some serious setbacks in its early days.\n\nThe startup struggled during the dotcom crash in 2002 and the financial crisis in 2008, when demand for its products plummeted.\n\nWhen everything was going wrong, the company wasn’t shy about making clear to employees how close they were to the brink. In fact, a mantra for Nvidia in its early years was: “Our company is 30 days from going out of business.”\n\n“We have the benefit of building the company from the ground up and having not exaggerated circumstances of nearly going out of business a handful of times,” Huang said last November at Harvard Business Review’s virtual Future of Business conference. “We don’t have to pretend the company is always in peril. The company is always in peril, and we feel it.”\n\nHuang believes it’s critical for leaders to always remember how close they are to failure. “You’re always on the way to going out of business,” he said at Columbia Business School’s Digital Future Initiative last fall. “If you don’t internalize that sensibility, you will go out of business.”\n\nCollaboration is key\n\nHuang couldn’t have amassed his AI and chip empire without collaborating with his top lieutenants.\n\nIn forming a system of governance, Nvidia decided to split decision-making among Huang and his fellow founders, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Even though Malachowksy and Priem worked under Huang’s command, they each had authority and led their own divisions within the company.\n\n“We would talk or argue over each other’s decisions, but we would default to the final decision of the person who had the expertise in that area,” Priem told the Wall Street Journal in December last year. “It wasn’t ‘agree to disagree.’ The decision terminated any disagreements and became the direction we were going.”\n\nShare your failures\n\nHuang believes that “failure must be shared,” and doesn’t shy away from taking ownership and pointing out errors that led to larger companywide problems.\n\nBack in the early 2000s, Nvidia ran into some trouble with a faulty graphic card that had a loud fan. Instead of firing the product managers, Huang held a meeting where the people involved walked through the mistakes that led to creating a bad product.\n\nExhibiting one’s failures has become a cultural fixture at Nvidia, but it’s not for everyone.\n\n“You can kind of see right away who is going to last here and who is not,” Dwight Diercks, head of software for Nvidia, toldThe New Yorker last November. “If someone starts getting defensive, I know they’re not going to make it.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Adds closing market prices)\n\n*\n\nNvidia's eye-popping results drives global tech rally\n\n*\n\nTokyo's Nikkei scores first record high since 1989\n\n*\n\nS&P 500, Dow, STOXX 600, MSCI ACWI also post records\n\n*\n\nBond yields mostly higher waiting for rate cuts\n\n*\n\nGraphic: World FX rates http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Marc Jones\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - AI chipmaker Nvidia's stunning results sparked a worldwide wave of record highs in equity markets on Thursday, including the first new peak for Japan's Nikkei since 1989, while bond yields mostly rose as economic data kept immediate hopes of interest rate cuts at bay.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wall Street, along with Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 index and MSCI's all-country world index also hit record highs as Nvidia's shares surged 16.4% and lifted artificial intelligence-related chip stocks around the globe.\n\nNational bourses in Frankfurt and Paris set fresh highs too, while Chinese stocks overnight extended their winning streak to eight straight sessions.\n\nAfter the bell on Wednesday, Nvidia forecast a roughly three-fold jump in first-quarter revenue and beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips. Nvidia added $277 billion in stock market value, the biggest one-day gain in a company's market capitalization in history.\n\nArtificial intelligence provides the means to boost productivity that economies have been seeking for two decades, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.\n\n\"What Nvidia represents is the catalyst for the roaring '20s in terms of productivity enhancement moving forward and as productivity increases, it keeps a lid on inflation,\" he said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rallied 1.67% to set closing and intra-day record highs, while the STOXX 600 index in Europe closed up 0.82% after hitting an all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe STOXX technology index is up 12.4% year-to-date and is trading at more than 23-year highs. Dutch chipmaking equipment supplier BESI rose 4.9% to a record after exceeding fourth-quarter targets on demand for AI-related parts.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.18%, to close above 39,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 advanced 2.11% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.96%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their biggest single-day gains since January and February 2023, respectively.\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, indicating job growth likely remains solid in February and will reduce the urgency for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.\n\nThe dollar index hit a three-week low and then pared losses as investors awaited new data for insight into when the Fed might begin cutting rates.\n\nThe dollar index was down 0.038%, with the euro rising 0.05% to $1.0822.\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying about 7% and 8%, respectively, driven in large part by the expectations for AI. Nvidia is at the center of that boom.\n\nThursday's record-setting charge included Tokyo Electron jumping 6%, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest surging 7.5% and another chip-related share, Screen Holdings, rallying more than 10%.\n\n\"It has taken the Nikkei roughly 34 years to get to this record high but it is all being driven by strong earnings upgrades,\" said Absolute Strategy's global equities analyst Nick Nelson.\n\nThere was a big difference from the last time the Nikkei peaked during its bubble, Nelson said. When the Nikkei set the all-time high in 1989, stocks were valued at almost four times what they are now, Nelson said.\n\nEuro zone yields drifted to multi-month highs as markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts to less than 100 bps this year after Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were concerned about moving too early.\n\nThe latest ECB minutes showed its rate-setters were sticking with patience while new PMI data showed the downturn in euro zone business activity eased in February.\n\nThe two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 5.9 basis points at 4.712%.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 0.2 basis points to 4.321% as longer-duration bonds were flat.\n\nWhile the bulk of Fed policymakers said they were concerned about the risks of cutting too soon, according to its meeting minutes, there was still broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current lofty level.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nOil prices steadied as a big rise in U.S. crude inventories offset the supportive impact of another attack on shipping near Yemen.\n\nU.S. crude rose 70 cents to settle at $78.61 a barrel, and Brent settled up 64 cents at $83.6 a barrel.\n\nGold prices fell from a near two-week high after jobless claims data indicated a strong U.S. economy, while investors awaited further economic data for guidance on the Fed's interest rate stance.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower to $2030.70 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Marc Jones in London; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Will Dunham and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted another monster quarter, a jubilant Jim Cramer praised the company's CEO Jensen Huang and went on to \"grade\" the Magnificent Seven stocks based on their earnings performance in a latest program on CNBC. Cramer said he wanted to see which stocks in the Mag. 7 group deserve the praise and a role in the \"trillion dollar chase\" and which companies \"might be pretenders.\"\n\nCramer called NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Huang the \"Taylor Swift\" of business and a \"long-term visionary.\"\n\nJim Cramer \"Grades\" Magnificent Seven Stocks After Earnings\n\nJim Cramer also praised Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and said there was a time when the market was starting to think Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s growth might be slowing down but the company did an excellent job by spending money to improve its delivery service. Cramer also said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s advertising business is \"on fire\" and AWS is back to double digit growth.\n\nJim Cramer is also bullish on Meta Platforms and said he thinks WhatsApp has a $100 billion valuation.\n\nRegarding Microsoft, Cramer said you don’t have to \"worry about this one\" as he thinks Microsoft's Cloud business is \"smoking hot.\"\n\nJim Cramer's thoughts on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are mixed in the short-term as he believes China \"remains an issue.\" However, Cramer is bullish on Apple Vision Pro and also likes strong iPhone sales. Jim Cramer repeated his \"own it don’t trade it\" mantra for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nJim Cramer is in a wait-and-see mode on Alphabet because he was disappointed with the company's advertising business. Cramer said while Meta and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) thrived in their ads business, Alphabet failed to impress, and the fact that YouTube and Search business of Alphabet are based on ads business worries him.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Tesla is the weakest company in the Mag. 7 group of stocks according to Jim Cramer as the CNBC host yet again pitched Eli Lilly as its replacement in the group.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that a single quarter should not make or break a stock and he believes in long-term approach in investing. Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks\n\nMethodology For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment for these stocks. Why? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 9\n\nA questioner recently asked Jim Cramer about his thoughts on midstream energy infrastructure company MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX). Cramer said \"I like it very much.\" Cramer said he was telling some \"colleagues\" recently that \"these master limited partnership pipelines are very good.\"\n\nCramer said that MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) is \"like a fixed income bond.\"\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that just nine hedge funds had stakes in MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX).\n\nLast month MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) posted fourth quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.10 beating estimates by $0.17. Revenue in the period jumped 11.7% year over year to $2.97 billion, surpassing estimates by $120 million.\n\n9. Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nFintech company known for buy now pay later solutions Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) is one of the top Jim Cramer stock picks as of February 2024. Cramer recently said in a program that \"you've got a winner with Affirm.\"\n\nCramer said that Levchin (Max Levchin, the founder of Affirm) is \"constantly underrated.\" He said that people don’t understand that the \"guy has got passion.\" Cramer said that \"they keep thinking\" Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) is going to \"bust\" but \"they are wrong.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM). The biggest stakeholder of Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) during this period was D. E. Shaw which had a $461 million stake in Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM).\n\n8. Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nZscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently recommended investors to buy in 2024. Answering a question about Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS), Cramer praised Zscaler's Zero Trust security platform and said the stock is a \"good one\" to buy. Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) shares are down by about 11% over the past one month and Jim Cramer believes this dip is an opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nLike Zscaler, Cramer also loves Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS). The most notable stakeholder of Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) was D E Shaw which had a $268 million stake in Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), BioNTech and Ingersoll Rand. Zscaler provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced solid financial results including 43% revenue growth and 38% growth in billings, which were both ahead of expectations. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (e.g., Office 365 and Salesforce) and more remote workers than before the pandemic make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. The stock has been a top performer this year, and we decided to trim the position based on valuation considerations.”\n\n7. General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 49\n\nA caller asked Jim Cramer about his thoughts on General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) during his program on CNBC. Cramer recommended the investor to \"stick with\" the stock and said:\n\n\"Oh, I love that CEO.\"\n\nCramer said that General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) is not expensive. He also said \"problems overseas\" (a reference to the geopolitical situation) are expected to bode well for the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds out of the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). The biggest stakeholder of General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) during this period was James A. Star's Longview Asset Management with a $7.3 billion stake.\n\n6. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nJim Cramer was not impressed with Home Depot Inc's (NYSE:HD) numbers for the fourth quarter where comp. sales fell 3.5% during the period (still better than a 3.6% expected decline) and sales per retail square foot dropped 3.6% to $550.50.  But Cramer recommended investors to hold on to Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) and wait for the turnaround which he believes is around the corner.\n\n“Sure, the quarter wasn’t great, but the conference call commentary I found encouraging, which is why I’m willing to be patient and hold on to Home Depot. Remember, you can’t wait for the actual turn, you have to get in ahead of time or you’ll miss the move.”\n\nJim Cramer also thinks Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) shares can gain in the future on the back of the \"spring planting season, which is like Christmas for any retailer with a gardening business.\"\n\nIn addition to Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), Jim Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has long been a leader in advancing sustainable forestry, and its wood products can have a significant impact, as timber rates at the top of high-risk commodities responsible for most agriculture-related deforestation (Exhibit 3). The home improvement retailer adopted its first wood purchasing policy in 1999, pledging to give preference to sustainably sourced wood and to eliminate wood purchases from endangered regions around the world.\n\nBiodiversity-boosting efforts at Home Depot have included tracing the origin of all the wood products it sells. This forms part of the process of verifying sustainable production, which it does using the certification standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Since 2000 Home Depot has developed programs to purchase FSC wood products, such as doors, boards and patio furniture, from over 60 global suppliers. It has also moved more than 90% of its cedar purchases to second-and third-growth forests, with the rest coming from areas with local community stakeholder review.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Major US Stock Indexes Hit Records as Nvidia Rekindles AI Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- All three major American stock indexes stormed to fresh all-time highs Thursday as Nvidia Corp.’s results rekindled faith that breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will boost profits and give stock prices further room to run.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales Stocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets Wrap T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code AT&T Says Mobile Network Restored as US Starts Investigation Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024\n\nThe chipmaker’s blowout earnings report sparked a broad-based rally across Wall Street, sending the S&P 500 Index to its 12th record close of 2024 and leaving it up nearly 24% since late October. The Nasdaq 100 Index soared 3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average — which is considered a proxy for US economic health — eclipsed 39,000 for the first time.\n\nOf course, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been posting simultaneous records off and on since the latter part of January — a feat that hadn’t happened since November 2021.\n\nBut the milestones drew fresh attention on Thursday, when the Dow rallied 1.1% and the 500-member index gained 2.2%. Meanwhile, the MSCI ACWI Index of both developed and emerging-market shares hit its highest level ever.\n\n“We are seeing high-growth and high-margin tech titans break new ground in generating profits and investors are rewarding this brave new world,” said Michael Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “All in, the new historic highs are in the right neighborhood, but perhaps investors are paying a slight premium to live in this swanky neighborhood.”\n\nNvidia added nearly $280 billion to its capitalization — the biggest single-session increase ever, eclipsing a $197 billion gain made by Meta Platforms Inc.’s at the start of the month. The company’s market value has increased by more than $700 billion this year alone at $1.9 trillion, eclipsing both Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s outlook boosted other chipmakers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Marvell Technology Inc. and Broadcom Inc., as well as other Big Tech firms. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index — which includes bellwethers like Nvidia, Broadcom and AMD — jumped 5% for its best day since May.\n\nThursday’s sharp rebound follows a few turbulent sessions in the past week, highlighting just how resilient the US stock market has been by overcoming worries over weak breadth underneath the surface.\n\nThat said, the rally wasn’t as broad as bulls may have hoped. Only 73% of the S&P 500’s constituents rallied on Thursday. The last 11 times the gauge rallied more than 2% in a day, at least 90% of its members advanced. While 10 of the 11 S&P 500 sectors rallied, utilities lost 0.8%.\n\n“It always feels the best before the hangover,” said Scott Colyer, chief executive at Advisors Asset Management. “We are well overdue for a correction since only a handful of shares are driving indexes higher. But we could still see this rally keep chugging along before a serious selloff because we still aren’t seeing more stocks hitting new lows yet.”\n\nStocks have climbed steadily since late last year, powered by investor expectation that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates later this year. All three major indexes have recouped all of their losses from the central bank’s aggressive interest-rate hikes to tame inflation.\n\nThe continued US economic expansion and strong corporate earnings have also helped support equities.\n\n“The confidence level has been very sticky, you haven’t seen a lot of dispersion among traders in terms of their decision making,” said Joe Mazzola, director of trading and education at Charles Schwab & Co. “The concern around a recession has dropped pretty dramatically, and a lot of that has to do with some positive economic data.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA24’s Risky Hollywood Moment Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market How Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "*\n\nNvidia surges as revenue forecast tops estimates, lifts AI peers\n\n*\n\nRivian and Lucid fall as 2024 production targets disappoint\n\n*\n\nWeekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall\n\n*\n\nS&P 500, Dow Jones close at record highs\n\n(Updates to close)\n\nBy David French\n\nFeb 22 (Reuters) -\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both surged to close at record highs on Thursday, powered by investors piling into growth and technology stocks the day after artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia's bumper earnings and outlook.\n\nNvidia's shares leaped after the chip designer forecast a roughly three-fold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips and beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue.\n\nThe company's earnings were a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street that first pushed the S&P 500 above the 5,000 point mark earlier this month. Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.\n\nInstead, the S&P 500 ended at a record high, as did the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed above 39,000 for the first time.\n\nUnofficial closing data showed the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 456.54 points, or 1.18%, to 39,068.78, the S&P 500 gained 105.14 points, or 2.11%, to 5,086.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 460.75 points, or 2.96%, to 16,041.62.\n\n\"As Nvidia goes, so goes the world,\" joked Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\n\nHe noted how Nvidia's earnings performance trounced high market expectations, showing doubters that plenty of juice was left in the AI trade after the recent rally.\n\n\"When do you sell - maybe you don't. Maybe there's still room, and I'm happy to sit and ride it out,\" Janasiewicz added.\n\nNvidia additions to its market capitalization on Thursday beat Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month as the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.\n\nMost of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains.\n\nThe S&P 500 growth index advanced by its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022.\n\nShares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped.\n\nSynopsys soared after the software maker for chip designers after reporting estimate-beating earnings and outlook.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index also jumped, as did Big Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nROBOT\n\nMeanwhile, investors' bets are tilted towards June as the starting point for the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Thursday he would be looking at the totality of incoming economic data in assessing the time for the U.S. central bank to begin cutting its benchmark policy rate.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a tight labor market.\n\nElsewhere, vaccine maker Moderna jumped after surprising investors with a fourth-quarter profit. The stock's technicals also pointed to a bullish outlook.\n\nHowever, Rivian and Lucid tumbled, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Shinjini Ganguli and David Gregorio)",

Nvdia added $250 billion in stock market value, on track for the biggest one-day gain in a company's market capitalization in history.\n\nArtificial intelligence provides the means to boost productivity that economies have struggled to increase for two decades, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.\n\n\"What Nvidia represents is the catalyst for the roaring '20s in terms of productivity enhancement moving forward and as productivity increases, it keeps a lid on inflation,\" he said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rallied 1.68%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.82%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1%, the S&P 500 advanced 2.09% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.96%, its biggest single-day gain in 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, indicating job growth likely remains solid in February and will reduce the urgency for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.\n\nThe dollar index pared some losses after earlier hitting a three-week low as investors awaited new data for insight into when the Fed is likely to begin cutting interest rates.\n\nThe dollar index was down 0.01%, with the euro rising 0.02% to $1.0819.\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying about 7% and 8%, respectively, driven in large part by the expectations for AI. Nvidia is at the center of that boom.\n\nThursday's record-setting charge included Tokyo Electron jumping 6%, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest surging 7.5% and another chip-related share, Screen Holdings, rallying more than 10%.\n\n\"It has taken the Nikkei roughly 34 years to get to this record high but it is all being driven by strong earnings upgrades,\" said Absolute Strategy's global equities analyst Nick Nelson.\n\nThere was a big difference from the last time the Nikkei peaked during its bubble, Nelson said. When the Nikkei set the all-time high in 1989, stocks were valued at almost four times what they are now, Nelson said.\n\nEuro zone yields drifted to multi-month highs as markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts to less than 100 bps this year after Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were concerned about moving too early.\n\nThe latest ECB minutes showed its rate-setters were sticking with patience while new PMI data showed the downturn in euro zone business activity eased in February.\n\nThe two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 5.9 basis points at 4.712%.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 0.2 basis points to 4.325% as longer-duration bonds were flat.\n\nWhile the bulk of Fed policymakers said they were concerned about the risks of cutting too soon, according to its meeting minutes, there was still broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current lofty level.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nOil prices steadied as a big rise in U.S. crude inventories offset the supportive impact of another attack on shipping near Yemen.\n\nU.S. crude rose 70 cents to settle at $78.61 a barrel, and Brent settled up 64 cents at $83.6 a barrel.\n\nGold prices fell from a near two-week high after jobless claims data indicated a strong U.S. economy, while investors awaited further economic data for guidance on the Fed's interest rate stance.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower to $2030.70 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Marc Jones in London; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Will Dunham)",

The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index climbed over 3%.\n\n“This may be a catalyst, not only for the Street to get materially more bullish on US equities, but also to see a further decoupling of stocks and yields since the Magnificent 7 are proving to deliver on earnings expectations irrespective of the interest rate environment,” Tyler wrote.\n\nStock-market investors were eagerly awaiting the Nvidia results, largely on hopes that it would rekindle the sentiment that helped drive last year’s rally.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 hit fresh record highs this year, the advance had stalled recently after hotter-than-expected consumer- and producer-price readings caused traders to dial back their expectations for interest rate cuts.\n\n“It’s kind of a microcosm of the market,” said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. “We’ve been wondering with the market erupting like it has off of most factors, whether earnings can meet the moment.

        "title": "Nvidia says future growth will come from 'sovereign AI'",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rocketed higher on Thursday after the company reported Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street’s lofty expectations, thanks to sky-high data center graphics chip sales.\n\nBut CEO Jensen Huang isn’t just banking on selling AI chips to companies. He’s also looking at selling to entire countries as part of a concept known as sovereign AI.\n\n“The language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different,” Huang said during Nvidia’s earnings call. “And they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it to create their own digital intelligence, and provision it to harness that raw material themselves.”\n\nSovereign AI boils down to a single country or region setting up its own AI capabilities, allowing its AI to meet its own needs.\n\n“In regions outside of the US and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver,” said Nvidia CFO Colette Kress. Jensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., speaks during the Hon Hai Tech Day in Taipei on October 18, 2023. (Photo by I-Hwa Cheng / AFP) (Photo by I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\n“Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems,” she added.\n\nAccording to Huang, Japan, Canada, France, and a number of other regions are already setting up their own sovereign AI systems.\n\nOf course, sovereign AI isn’t the only thing driving Nvidia’s sales. In fact, the company said that more than half of its Data Center sales, which accounted for $18.4 billion of the firm’s $22.1 billion in overall revenue, came from large cloud providers.\n\nA number of those large cloud providers, however, are working on their own specialized AI chips that will prove more efficient in terms of performance and power compared to Nvidia’s chips. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft already have or are developing their own chips as a means of weaning off of their dependence on Nvidia. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t taking the challenge lying down. According to Reuters, the company has reportedly reached out to the three cloud providers with the hopes of producing those custom chips for them.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s not as though Nvidia is hurting at the moment, though. The chip giant raked in nearly as much revenue in Q4 as it did in all of last year: $27 billion. And it’s expected to bring in even more next quarter, with guidance calling for revenue of $24 billion plus or minus 2%.\n\nAnd if it can sell to entire countries the way it’s been selling to Big Tech companies, there’s no telling how much higher Nvidia could go.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.\n\n\"The whole package of Nvidia's reporting lends a bedrock of credibility for other AI and technology companies as it clearly appears that Nvidia and AI are here to stay,\" said Andre Bakhos, president at Ingenium Analytics.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrials also breached 39,000 points for the first time in early-afternoon trading, as the positive momentum spread widely. It was up last up 425.67 points, or 1.1%, at 39,037.91. The Nasdaq Composite was up 452.29 points, or 2.9%, at 16,033.16, above the 16,000 mark for the first time since Feb. 12.\n\nNvidia was set to add over $250 billion to its market capitalization if gains held, beating Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month in the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.\n\nThe benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.\n\nStory continues\n\nTen of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains with a 4.2% jump. Utilities was the outlier, slipping 0.5%.\n\nThe S&P 500 growth index rose 3.16%, headed for its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022.\n\nShares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped between 9.2% and 33.2%.\n\nSynopsys hit a record high earlier in the day after the software maker for chip designers after reporting estimate-beating earnings and outlook. Despite giving up some gains, it was still 7% higher in mid-afternoon trade.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index also hit a record high, jumping 5.2%.\n\nBig Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms rose between 0.8% and 4.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, investors' bets are tilted towards June as the starting point for the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Thursday he would be looking at the totality of incoming economic data in assessing the time for the U.S. central bank to begin cutting its benchmark policy rate.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a tight labor market.\n\nElsewhere, vaccine maker Moderna jumped 15.7% after surprising investors with a fourth-quarter profit. The stock's technicals also pointed to a bullish outlook.\n\nHowever, Rivian fell 26.3% and Lucid tumbled 16.1%, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Shinjini Ganguli and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Coming off of Nvidia's (NVDA) mind-blowing fourth-quarter earnings results, CEO Jensen Huang stated \"accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" expecting to see exponential demand growth worldwide.\n\nNeuberger Berman Managing Director Dan Flax sits down with Yahoo Finance to talk Nvidia's value and growth expected out from its various business segments.\n\n\"If we think about what's going on here, Nvidia's solutions are empowering others, for example, cloud companies, to expand their business, create new revenue streams, and ultimately grow,\" Flax states. \"And so this broader story about Nvidia's platform, its ecosystem with millions of developers, remains vibrant. I think we'll see good growth the rest of this year into next year as supply continues to come online.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- Well, as we continue to dig into this, NVIDIA, of course, blowing minds once again, fueling further hype around AI with quarterly sales triple what they were a year ago. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang saying, quote, accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations. Well, joining us now is Dan Flax, Neuberger Berman managing director.\n\nDan, thank you so much for joining us. So in terms of the demand that we know is there, what about the capacity to meet that demand? How confident are you on that side?\n\nDAN FLAX: Good morning. I expect NVIDIA and its partners to continue to add capacity in the months and quarters ahead. If we think about what's going on here, NVIDIA solutions are empowering others-- for example, cloud companies, to expand their business, create new revenue streams, and ultimately grow. And so this broader story about NVIDIA's platform, its ecosystem with millions of developers, remains vibrant. I think we'll see good growth through the rest of this year into next year as supply continues to come online.\n\nStory continues\n\n- Dan, there are already concerns about the valuation of this particular stock going into earnings now, right behind Apple as well as Microsoft. Given the numbers that we got yesterday, does the valuation match where the company is? Do you see it pushing even higher?\n\nDAN FLAX: We think the stock remains attractive here. If we think about the next couple of years, driven by the product cycles, NVIDIA should generate significant free cash flow, and that free cash flow will continue to grow in our view. And so when we look at the valuation in that context relative to the growth prospects, I think the stock remains attractive here.\n\nTo be sure, these businesses are cyclical. They're, of course, product cycles, macro crosscurrents. But the underlying drivers of the business remain healthy in our view, and I think we'll learn more at the company's GTC conference next month about the product roadmap, which helps lay the foundation for additional growth.\n\n- And to that point because you would think that the idea is that, in that 10-year cycle that Jensen Huang was talking about, some of these costs should be expected to come down. How do you then gel that with what we might see in terms of the product roadmap as well as how they plan on executing, as you see, other companies coming in trying to really get on board, especially Intel here and really try and have some competition here.\n\nDAN FLAX: I think competition in this market will remain fierce. The key for NVIDIA is to continually drive value for their customers in New areas. So as they bring out, for example, their new architecture for the data center likely to be introduced next month, the performance, the capabilities, the features are going to enable NVIDIA's customers to add value in their businesses.\n\nThink about areas like drug discovery, fraud detection, climate change, really, the re-architecting of the Industrial landscape as you marry the physical and the digital. And so the growth and the use cases, I think, remain attractive. If we look at what some of the other companies are doing, I think AMD, for example, has an important role to play. CEO Lisa Su and her team are developing and continuing to broaden out their product roadmap in areas like the data center, GPU market. I think we're going to see good growth from there.\n\nWhat we saw from Intel yesterday in terms of their foundry strategy, I think CEO Pat Gelsinger and their team are continuing this multiyear investment strategy. I think, as we saw with their Microsoft customer announcement, Intel has an important role over the next several years to play in the foundry market, and more broadly, certainly in the data Center AI market.",

The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) — which saw its trading volume jump to a record of more than 3 million shares — surged as much as 31%, as did the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX), which follows a similar strategy.\n\nThe chipmaker’s forecast for another quarter of big revenue gains breathed fresh life into the euphoria about artificial intelligence that’s been powering the stock market’s rally. The company’s gain rippled across Wall Street, pushing up major indexes and the shares of other chipmakers.\n\n“It’s definitely the bullish optimism with Nvidia but also the entire semiconductor space,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital. “Broadcom and AMD have performed well and there is sentiment that AI will lead the Nasdaq higher.”\n\nRead more: New ETFs Riding Tesla’s Famous Volatility Arrive on Wall Street\n\nThe excitement extended the sharp increase in trading activity across ETFs tied to Nvidia, the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which has about one-fourth of its funds in Nvidia, has swelled to more than $15 billion after a three day influx of $612 million. It’s on track for its biggest weekly haul since October 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading volume in shares of GraniteShares’s NVDL set back-to-back daily records on Wednesday and Thursday, and its $236 million inflow this month is set to be the biggest since the $660 million fund’s 2022 inception. Activity in T-Rex’s NVDX and the Leverage Shares 3x NVIDIA ETP (NVD3) are also up sharply.\n\nInvestors also added a net $405 million to the $8.6 billion Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bull 3x Shares (SOXL), a fund that gives investors 3 times the return of an index that includes Nvidia. Its share price jumped as much as 16% to its highest since March 2022.\n\n“If there was ever a day to plow into leveraged exposure to NVDA, it’s now,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA24’s Risky Hollywood Moment Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market How Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect Consumers How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Shareholders in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The consensus statutory numbers for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) increased, with their view clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, the current consensus from NVIDIA's 53 analysts is for revenues of US$105b in 2025 which - if met - would reflect a huge 133% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to soar 190% to US$22.21. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$94b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$18.32 in 2025. So we can see there's been a pretty clear increase in analyst sentiment in recent times, with both revenues and earnings per share receiving a decent lift in the latest estimates.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nIt will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for NVIDIA 14% to US$802 on the back of these upgrades.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that NVIDIA's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 133% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2025 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 28% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 17% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that the consensus looks almost universally bullish, with a substantial increase to forecasts and a higher price target, NVIDIA could be worth investigating further.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple NVIDIA analysts - going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nAnother way to search for interesting companies that could be  reaching an inflection point is to track whether management are buying or selling, with our free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis\n\nFeb 22 (Reuters) - Nvidia identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late Wednesday.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips. The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nHuawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago.\n\nAnalysts have estimated China's AI chip market to be worth $7 billion.\n\nLast year, Reuters reported that Chinese search giant Baidu placed a chip order with Huawei ahead of widely anticipated new rules by the U.S. government tightened restrictions on advanced AI chips exported to China.\n\nOther rivals pointed out by Nvidia include Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and Qualcomm . The chip company also identified several large cloud computing companies such as Amazon.com and Microsoft\n\nNvidia shares surged 14% in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that topped consensus estimates as strong demand for AI continues.

In contrast, shares of ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML) and Applied Materials(NASDAQ: AMAT), two suppliers of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment that's essential to grow supplies of in-demand AI semiconductor chips, are performing much better -- up 4.2% and 4.7%, respectively.\n\nNvidia's earnings report\n\nWhy the disparate reactions to Nvidia's news? Well, let's take a look at the report itself.\n\nNvidia reported 265% year-over-year growth in its revenues in Q4 -- $22.1 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations. Adjusted earnings were pretty fantastic as well, up 486% at $5.16 per share, and also ahead of expectations.\n\nFully 83% of Nvidia's sales came from the company's data center segment, by the way, which is weighted heavily toward production of chips for new artificial intelligence services. And as this is a relatively new business, the implication is that demand for these chips is red hot. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AI has \"hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\" And this in turn implies that there's going to be need for even more production of AI chips, and therefore a need for more manufacturing equipment to make that production possible.\n\nRight there you've got your reason for why ASML and Applied Materials stocks are going up. (It doesn't hurt that this morning, ASML won a new buy rating from investment banker H.C. Wainwright, which said ASML holds a \"monopolistic position\" in lithography tools that will support its earnings.)\n\nMeanwhile, Intel investors may be feeling a bit left out as Nvidia roars ahead, gobbling up market share. Huang predicted Nvidia's sales will grow a further 8.5% sequentially in Q1 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Intel stock a sell? And are ASML and Applied Materials stocks buys?\n\nSo is all hope now lost for Intel? I don't think so.\n\nAll but lost in the uproar over Nvidia's earnings, you see, is the news that late last week, Bloomberg reported that Intel is in line to receive $10 billion in CHIPS and Science Act subsidies to build its new Ohio semiconductors factory. Also possibly lost in the shuffle: an announcement from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger that Intel has a whopping $15 billion in deals to manufacture semiconductor chips for other companies. These customers notably include Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), which wants to use Intel's \"18A\" technology to build a new artificial intelligence chip.\n\nAs money pours into the AI space from all directions, this seems like an excellent time to invest in pick-and-shovel plays such as ASML and Applied Materials. But what about Intel?\n\nWhile the stock still looks like something of a basket case with its weak earnings and even weaker (i.e. negative) free cash flow, sales are growing at Intel, too. And it seems obvious to me that Intel is going to want to get a piece of the fat AI profit margins that Nvidia keeps raking in. With customers clamoring at the door, and the U.S. government offering to foot much of the bill for Intel's expansion into AI, I wouldn't count Intel out of this race just yet.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The AI trade is back in full force after Nvidia's (NVDA) big earnings beat, defying fears that euphoria over the technology may have reached its peak.\n\nShares of Soundhound (SOUN) and Arm (ARM), companies Nvidia recently revealed it invested in, both rose on Thursday. AMD (AMD), another AI chip play, rose nearly 10% while AI-driven stock Palantir popped nearly 3%. SuperMicro Computers (SMCI), which has been on a meteoric 200% rise this year, soared nearly 20% on Thursday alone.\n\nThe reach of Nvidia's success was seen beyond just the tech space. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) touched new intraday record highs less than 30 minutes after the opening bell on Thursday. A slew of other companies that aren't AI focused, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Waste Management (WM), also touched fresh highs during the session.\n\nAll of these moves higher come just a week after a hotter-than-expected inflation report spawned a mini-market sell-off and as Federal Reserve officials continue to indicate interest rate cuts are likely to come later than many hoped. Normally, those two headwinds are large enough to drive the market action. Not on Thursday.\n\nTo Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel this resilience shown by the market amid major macro headwinds and high stock valuations has been simply \"impressive.\"\n\n\"FOMO operates on its own timetable, stocks can get more expensive, and the Momentum ends when it ends, which is often without warning,\" Emanuel said. \"FOMO, for now, Stays Bid.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday night that AI hit a \"tipping point\" as demand continues to surge. These comments — and the company's quarterly earnings overall —were like \"jet fuel\" to the bull thesis in tech, Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives said in a note to clients.\n\nThe looming market question remains how long this euphoria can last. Thursday's market action shows it still has legs for now.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The bottom line is I think it's too early to call it a bubble peak in AI,\" Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee told clients on Wednesday night.

        "content": "While many on Wall Street are usually very concerned with market events like the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting minutes, it seems to have been eclipsed by Nvidia's (NVDA) fourth-quarter earnings results which surpassed estimates. Market indices like the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI) are moving higher despite lingering concerns with the Federal Reserve and interest rates.\n\nSanctuary Wealth Chief Investment Strategist Mary Ann Bartels joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into market movements after Nvidia's strong fourth-quarter report and the impact it may have going forward.\n\nOn whether or not this type of growth is concerning, Bartels explains: \"I personally feel the growth that you're seeing justifies the valuations. And what we've actually written is when you're in a secular bull market, which we believe the equity markets went into a secular bull market in 2013, PE multiples expand. Although we all love to buy value and low PEs, once you start that secular bull market, PEs never come down to the level where they started from. So we're actually looking for PE multiples to continue to expand and we think they can actually expand into 2029 and 2030. We think PE valuations on select companies, particularly in technology, are going to go to levels that are really going to shock investors.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.\n\n\"The whole package of Nvidia's reporting lends a bedrock of credibility for other AI and technology companies as it clearly appears that Nvidia and AI are here to stay,\" said Andre Bakhos, president at Ingenium Analytics.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrials also hit a record high of 38,994.50 points earlier in the day and was last up 280.22 points, or 0.73%, at 38,892.46. The Nasdaq Composite was up 380.60 points, or 2.44%, at 15,961.47.\n\nNvidia was set to add over $250 billion to its market capitalization if gains held, beating Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month in the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.\n\nThe benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.\n\nStory continues\n\nNine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains with a 3.8% jump.\n\nThe S&P 500 growth index rose 2.8%, headed for its biggest one-day percentage gain since November 2022.\n\nShares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped between 7.6% and 26%.\n\nThe Philadelphia Semiconductor index hit a record high, jumping 4.7%.\n\nBig Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms rose between 1.8% and 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, investors' bets are tilted towards June as the starting point for the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nFed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson said on Thursday he would be looking at the totality of incoming economic data in assessing the time for the U.S. central bank to begin cutting its benchmark policy rate.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting a tight labor market.\n\nRivian and Lucid fell 27.0% and 19.5%, respectively, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.88-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.21-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 66 new 52-week highs and one new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 90 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "7 Earnings Losers With a Shot at a Strong Comeback",
        "content": "While companies who rank among the earnings losers category don’t obviously generate confidence, it’s also important to keep in mind the big picture. Technology juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides an extreme example of this.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Nvidia posted earnings per share of 58 cents. This tally represented a stinker against the estimated EPS target of 70 cents. The company took it personally. Since then, the company has been beating its targets, continuing to impress onlookers up until the most recent Q4 print.\n\nAs it turns out, people were wrong to question Nvidia. I was flat-out wrong for even being pensive about the continued hype over artificial intelligence and related innovations. And while I’m not saying that all earnings losers have NVDA potential in them, you don’t want to dismiss the red-stained enterprises until you’ve had a closer look.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that, below are the earnings losers that could turn things around.\n\nCelanese (CE) Cellphone with logo of US chemicals company Celanese Corporation (CE) on screen in front of business website Focus on center-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nA technology and specialty materials company, Celanese (NYSE:CE) hasn’t had the greatest start to the new year. Heading into its fourth-quarter earnings report, analysts anticipated that Celanese would post EPS of $2.29. However, the actual result landed at $2.24. Other sources provide slightly different analyst consensus stats but the point remains: Celanese fell short.\n\nAlso, the company generated revenue of $2.57 billion. This too missed the consensus view of $2.59 billion. Overall, it wasn’t a good look for the company. However, I believe CE is one of the earnings losers that can make good for shareholders soon enough.\n\nPrimarily, the catalyst surrounding the business is its relevance. One of the company’s specialty materials is vinyl acetate monomer, an intermediate material used in the production of various resins and polymers. End products include paints, coatings, adhesives, sealants and other industrial and consumer applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, analysts still rate shares a consensus moderate buy. The high-side target lands at $176, implying 17% upside potential.\n\nCasella Waste Systems (CWST) An image of a magnifying glass zooming in on an Apple web page with a red, yellow, and green circle buttons, two arrow buttons, another button, and the \"Casella\" logo.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA waste management company, Casella Waste Systems (NASDAQ:CWST) does a dirty job, so to speak. Of course, it’s one of the most important ones for the proper functioning of society. However, this core relevance wasn’t enough to save the business from being one of the recent earnings losers.\n\nHeading into the Q4 earnings report, analysts anticipated Casella’s EPS to land at 16 cents. Unfortunately, the company missed the market by 3 pennies. In Q4 of last year, Casella also missed its consensus analyst target. However, it did manage to post EPS of 18 cents. Also, the revenue front didn’t provide much relief, coming in at $359.57 million against a consensus target of $360.08 million.\n\nDespite slumping as one of the earnings losers, CWST stock should be fine in the long run. We’re talking about an underlying business that clearly benefits from a natural monopoly. With high barriers to entry, Casella should be entrenched.\n\nAlso, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $99 price target, implying over 9% growth potential.\n\nUS Foods (USFD) A table is spread with breakfast foods like orange juice, berries and croissants. represents food and beverage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA services provider for the namesake industry, US Foods (NYSE:USFD) helps distribute calories (if you will) for various industries. These sectors include healthcare, hospitality, restaurants, retail and educational establishments. By logical deduction, it’s one of the most relevant businesses. Again, though, relevance alone can’t always shore up the financials.\n\nHeading into the company’s Q4 earnings report, analysts anticipated that US Foods would deliver EPS of 66 cents. However, the company ended up falling 2 cents shy of the target. On the sales front, management reported a tally of $8.94 billion. This figure beat the experts’ consensus view of $8.8 billion.\n\nDespite the mixed results, USFD stock appears to be on solid footing. Therefore, it’s hard to call it one of the earnings losers. Since the start of the year, shares gained almost 9%. Over the past 52 weeks, they’re up more than 27%.\n\nAnalysts view US Foods as a strong buy with a $55.25 average price target, implying almost 11% growth.\n\nDoorDash (DASH) Close up of Doordash (DASH) logo and symbol displayed at the entrance to one of their offices\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline food ordering and delivery platform DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) presents an intriguing conundrum. Looking at the print, the company technically represented one of the earnings losers. Per data from TipRanks, analysts anticipated Q4 loss per share to sit at 13 cents. Unfortunately, DoorDash posted a loss of 39 cents a share.\n\nOn the revenue side, circumstances were much different. Heading into the financial disclosure, the Street’s experts saw the delivery platform ringing up $2.25 billion in sales. Here, the company beat the estimate with a total haul of $2.3 billion. Moving forward, DASH stock presents a mixture of risk and reward.\n\nOn the risk side, DoorDash may suffer from political dynamics, particularly the raising of the minimum wage. Management claims that order volume has dropped sharply in areas that have significantly raised the aforementioned payout metric. On the flipside, rising e-commerce sales suggest that consumers still appreciate the convenience of home deliveries.\n\nAnalysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $128.09 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential. For the adventurous speculator, it might be worth picking up on a relative discount.\n\nCF Industries (CF) A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.\n\nSource: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.com\n\nA manufacturer and distributor of agricultural fertilizers, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) plays a vital role in the broader food supply chain. However, investors haven’t really been keen on the company. Given the unstable geopolitical environment, it’s difficult to get a read on the agricultural sector. In particular, the underlying ammonia, urea and ammonium nitrate product ecosystems present challenges.\n\nAhead of CF’s Q4 earnings, analysts anticipated EPS to land at $1.56. That’s a marked decline from last year’s forecasted estimate of $4.30. Even so, the company missed the target, coming in at $1.50 per share. However, the top line provided some optimism. Against a forecast of $1.51 billion, CF rang up $1.57 billion in revenue.\n\nWhat’s notable here is that in Q3 2023, the agricultural giant posted sales of $1.27 billion (which missed the analyst consensus by $20 million). Therefore, CF could be on its way higher toward a recovery.\n\nAnalysts are hoping that narrative pans out. They rate shares a consensus moderate buy with an $89 price target, implying over 14% upside.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA real estate investment trust (REIT), Realty Income (NYSE:O) invests in free standing, single-tenant commercial properties. They’re located in the U.S., Spain and the U.K. Perhaps its most notable attribute among investors is that the company pays a monthly dividend. That can be very helpful in terms of consistently reinvesting one’s earnings more frequently.\n\nHowever, this attribute didn’t exactly help on the earnings front. Ahead of the Q4 disclosure, analysts projected EPS to land at 33 cents. However, Realty only managed to come in at 30 cents. Fortunately, the revenue picture was much more encouraging. Against a forecast of $1.02 billion, the REIT rang up sales of $1.08 billion.\n\nYes, on the bottom line, Realty ranks among the earnings losers. Still, this is one loser that you should bet on, no question. With a forward dividend yield of 5.84%, the REIT is quite generous. Also, it features 31 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nLastly, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $61.60 price target, implying 17% growth potential.\n\nCaesars Entertainment (CZR) Caesar's Palace (CZR) in Las Vegas\n\nSource: Jason Patrick Ross/Shutterstock.com\n\nSince the start of the year, Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) has been struggling for traction. It’s not difficult to see why. With households wrestling with stubbornly elevated inflation along with high borrowing costs, they’ve had difficulty making ends meet. As a result, many budgets for discretionary expenditures – including renting rooms at Caesars – got slashed.\n\nTo be sure, the company’s recent earnings performance didn’t help matters. Against a targeted loss of 4 cents per share in Q4, management disclosed a loss of 34 cents per share. Adding to the misery, Caesars printed revenue of $2.83 billion. Unfortunately, Wall Street expected the casino and resort business to hit $2.85 billion.\n\nOne of the ugliest earnings losers, CZR stock nevertheless might appeal to extreme contrarians. According to a relatively recent study, revenge travel could remain a strong phenomenon this year. If so, that might make Caesars one of the top surprises.\n\nNotably, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $59.18 average target, implying over 40% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Adds analyst comment, paragraphs 5-6, updates prices at 11:45 pm. ET (1645 GMT))\n\n*\n\nNvidia's stellar results drives global tech rally\n\n*\n\nTokyo's Nikkei scores first record high since 1989\n\n*\n\nS&P 500, STOXX 600 also at record highs\n\n*\n\nBond yields mostly higher waiting for rate cuts\n\n*\n\nGraphic: World FX rates http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Marc Jones\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Nvidia's stunning AI-related outlook sparked a worldwide wave of record highs in equity markets on Thursday, including the first new peak for Japan's Nikkei since 1989, but bond yields mostly rose as economic data kept immediate hopes of interest rate cuts at bay.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index on Wall Street and Europe's pan-regional STOXX 600 index also hit fresh record highs as Nvidia's shares jumped 15.2% and lifted artificial intelligence-related chip stocks around the world.\n\nNational bourses in Frankfurt and Paris also set fresh highs, while Chinese stocks overnight extended their winning streak to eight straight sessions.\n\nNvidia on Wednesday beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a roughly three-fold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips. Nvdia could add more than $200 billion in market capitalization if the day's gains hold.\n\nArtificial intelligence provides the means to boost productivity that economies have struggled to increase for two decades, said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.\n\n\"What Nvidia represents is the catalyst for the roaring '20s in terms of productivity enhancement moving forward and as productivity increases, it keeps a lid on inflation,\" Hayes said.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.43%, while he pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.91%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.73%, the S&P 500 gained 1.72% and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.46%.\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, indicating job growth likely remains solid in February and will reduce the urgency for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dollar index rebounded after earlier hitting a three-week low as investors awaited new data for insight into when the Fed is likely to begin cutting interest rates.\n\nThe dollar index rose 0.038%, with the euro down 0.04% to $1.0813.\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying about 5% each, driven in large part by the expectations for AI, with Nvidia's chips at the center of the boom.\n\nThursday's record-setting charge included Tokyo Electron jumping 6%, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest surging 7.5% and another chip-related share, Screen Holdings, rallying more than 10%.\n\n\"It has taken the Nikkei roughly 34 years to get to this record high but it is all being driven by strong earnings upgrades,\" said Absolute Strategy's global equities analyst Nick Nelson.\n\nThere was a big difference from the last time the Nikkei peaked during its bubble, Nelson said. When the Nikkei peaked in 1989, stocks were valued at almost four times what they are now, Nelson said.\n\nEuro zone yields drifted to multi-month highs as money markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts to less than 100 bps this year after Fed minutes on Wednesday showed policymakers were concerned about moving too early.\n\nThe latest ECB minutes showed its rate-setters were sticking with patience while new PMI data showed the downturn in euro zone business activity eased in February.\n\nThe two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 5.6 basis points at 4.709%.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes was unchanged to 4.323% as longer-duration bonds were flat.\n\nWhile the bulk of Fed policymakers said they were concerned about the risks of cutting too soon, according to its meeting minutes, there was still broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current lofty level.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nOil prices steadied as a big rise in U.S. crude inventories offset the supportive impact of another attack on shipping near Yemen.\n\nU.S. crude recently rose 0.82% to $78.55 per barrel and Brent was at $83.54, up 0.61% on the day.\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Will Dunham)",

The company posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, further fueling the hype over AI and chip makers.\n\nJeff Bierman, Theotrade Chief Market Technician, joins Yahoo Finance to discus Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings and the impact it has on the AI boom in the long-term.\n\nBierman elaborates on potential risks with the market's heavy focus on the tech sector: \"It calls into question traditional risk management and traditional investment management diversification. Diversification in this market is dead. It does not work. You can't tell me you're going to lay risk and spread it across 11 sectors and get a meaningful effective return. It's not working.

        "title": "Why Super Micro Computer Stock Surged Thursday Morning",
        "content": "Shares of server and storage solution specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro, resumed their relentless push higher Thursday, surging by as much as 21%. As of 10:56 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 19.4%.\n\nA check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, analyst commentary, and financial reports -- found no company-specific news fueling the gains, which suggests the rise was due primarily to a robust earnings report from a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nBlockbuster results\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (which ended Jan 28.), Nvidia's revenue soared by 265% year over year to a record $22.1 billion. The chipmaker's profits were equally robust as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surged by 486% to $5.16. Nvidia has arguably been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the accelerating adoption of generative AI, and its performance bodes well for continued strong growth for Supermicro.\n\nIt wasn't just Nvidia's results but its forecast that fueled Supermicro's move higher. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter, Nvidia's management is guiding for revenue of $241 billion, which would amount to year-over-year growth of 233%.\n\nWhat this all has to do with Supermicro\n\nIf Nvidia has been the standard-bearer for the rapid adoption of generative AI, Supermicro has been the trend's unsung hero. Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) have provided the computational horsepower for the AI revolution, but it's Supermicro's AI-centric servers that are making it possible for many users. And while Nvidia stock has gained 277% over the past year (as of this writing), Supermicro is up by more than 900%.\n\nAnalysts have been scrambling to update their models, with Supermicro picking up back-to-back Street-high price targets over the past week. The most recent sharp adjustment came earlier this week from Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who raised his price target from $700 to $1,300 while maintaining his buy rating on the stock. This suggests potential upside of 77% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a note to clients, the analyst posited that not only will Supermicro continue to profit from the growing adoption of AI, but will capture \"material\" share gains in the server market.\n\nDespite its relentless rise, Supermicro stock currently trades for just 2 times next year's sales, the very definition of a bargain stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 10.9% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.\n\nNvidia's guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nAMD's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 22 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for AMD and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that the company provided fourth-quarter results with revenue guidance for the next quarter falling below Wall Street's expectations. Specifically, the Data Center segment is expected to see flat sequential growth with \"the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp.\" Management provided additional color on the server market during the earnings call, \"So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious...\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this uncertainty, there were some positive points during the quarter. Revenue growth in the Data Center and Client segments more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded units, leading to a slight topline beat. On the AI front, management hesitated to provide market share projections, suggesting it is still early days. However, it reiterated the market estimate for the Data Center AI accelerator business growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. In addition, the company highlighted its production of AI GPUs (MI300X) to meet growing demand from major players like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta. With the AI GPU business expected to surpass $3.5 billion in 2024, there's certainly momentum in this area.\n\nOverall, it was a mixed quarter for the company, which likely didn't deliver the level of optimism expected by the market, especially considering the growing wave of investors excited about the new AI prospects and expecting AMD to be a top player in the GPU market.\n\nAMD is up 32.1% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $7,516.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

Some of the notable stocks reporting earnings during the week include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nStocks have had a good run since the fourth quarter of 2023 as markets expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024 amidst cooling inflation data.

With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes.

        "title": "Nvidia's Latest Results Are Proof Of AI's Turbocharging Potential For Business",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered its fourth quarter results and they smashed Wall Street’s expectations across the board as generative AI demand is surging across the globe. While the Data Center business is running the show, Nvidia’s gaming business also has an important role in its success. Over the last 12 months, Nvidia’s stock price easily surpassed those of its rivals, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on January 29th, Nvidia reported total revenue grew 265% to $22.10 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of $20.62 billion.  Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue skyrocket 217% to $18.4 billion, also beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. However, data center revenue was harmed by recent U.S. restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips to China.\n\nThe gaming segment brought in 2.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of $2.7 billion as it rose 56% YoY. Impressively, net income rose 769% YoY to $12.29 billion with adjusted earnings of $5.16 also topping LSEG's estimate of $4.64.\n\nCompetitive Threat Is Rising\n\nNvidia is undoubtedly at the top of its game, but its rivals are not standing still. Its main rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips. Moreover, AMD is claiming its new MI300X surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads. AMD rolled out the MI300X before 2023 came to an end, placing it as the industry’s most advanced AI accelerator.\n\nIntel also has its own server chips while it continues to work on expanding its own capabilities on the AI front.Interestingly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) turned to Intel and not Nvidia to make its future in-house chips. Microsoft plans to use 18A manufacturing technology that Intel developed. With this move, Microsoft will undoubtedly boost Intel and its made-to-order chip business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps an even bigger threat to Nvidia doesn’t come from its direct rivals but from its customers like Microsoft that are racing to develop their own specialized AI chips to lower their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Moreover, such customers brought in more than half of its Data Center revenue during the latest reported quarter, as Nvidia attributed more than half of quarterly revenue to large cloud providers for conducting internal workloads and external customers. Besides Microsoft, those that are either already offering or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips are Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and even the EV leader, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). However, Reuters reported that Nvidia has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI in an effort to get them on board to make custom chips for them.\n\nDuring the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $24 billion while CEO Jensen Huang assured investors that the AI chip leader is all set for continued growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "*\n\nTokyo's Nikkei scores first record high since 1989 Bumper forecasts from Nvidia drives global tech rally\n\n*\n\nEurope's at record high and Wall Street pointing higher\n\n*\n\nGraphic: World FX rates http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\nBy Marc Jones\n\nLONDON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Stocks bulls were on a supercharged stampede on Thursday as blockbuster earnings from world's most sought after company Nvidia set off a worldwide wave of record highs, including the first for Japan’s Nikkei since 1989.\n\nTech-loving Tokyo had raced up over 2.2% to top its previous all-time closing and intraday highs set at the peak of the country's so-called bubble economy more than three decades ago.\n\nEurope then set its own fresh peaks, with the regional STOXX 600, Frankfurt and Paris all joining in thanks to 0.6% to 1.3% gains.\n\nLondon's FTSE was a notable laggard due to its lack of tech firepower but Chinese equities had extended their winning run to an eighth straight session overnight and Wall Street's S&P and Nasdaq were expected to rocket at the open following Nvidia's stellar results.\n\nThe firm, which has been the most magnificent of the so-called Magnificent 7 set of global tech stocks, had forecast a roughly 233% surge in quarterly revenue, sending its shares up some 10% in pre open Wall Street trading.\n\n\"U.S. futures are up, strong - that's just Nvidia, right there,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com.\n\nElsewhere, long-term U.S. bond yields were nudging lower and the dollar drooped after Wednesday's minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting bolstered the view that interest rate cuts will now come slower than previously expected.\n\nBIG IN JAPAN\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying some 5% each, driven in large part by mammoth expectations for artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia's chips at the centre of that boom.\n\nThursday record setting charge included Tokyo Electron jumping 6%, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest surged 7.5% and another chip-related share, Screen Holdings rallied more than 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It has taken the Nikkei roughly 34 years to get to this record high but it is all being driven by strong earnings upgrades,\" said Absolute Strategy's global equities analyst Nick Nelson.\n\nHe said there was a big difference to the last time the Nikkei peaked during its bubble. Back then Japanese firm's trailing price-to-earnings were averaging at about 60 times. Now the metric is a more sensible 16 times.\n\n\"Nvidia also came overnight and U.S. Q4 reporting season has been pretty strong overall. Basically companies have delivered,\" Nelson added.\n\nBack in the bond markets it was all much more sedate.\n\nEuro zone yields drifted to multi-month highs as money markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts to less than 100 bps this year after Federal Reserve minutes showed its policymakers were concerned about moving too early.\n\nThe latest ECB minutes showed its ratesetters were sticking with patience while new PMI data showed the downturn in euro zone business activity eased in February.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield eased slightly in both European and Asian time to 4.30%, but remained close to the 4.332% level marked a week ago, which had not been seen since the end of November.\n\nWhile the bulk of Fed policymakers said they were concerned about the risks of cutting too soon according that its meeting minutes there was still broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current lofty level.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe dollar continued to retreat from a three-month high reached last week, when the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, reached 104.97. It was down 0.3% at 103.86 with the euro up 0.3% at $1.0851, sterling at $1.2647 and the yen broadly flat at 150.15 per dollar.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices rose, adding to gains from the previous session that came amid signs of tighter supply.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) gained 25 cents to $78.16 a barrel, while Brent added 47 cents to $83.47 a barrel and gold was on a 7-day winning streak at $2,030 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

        "title": "Nvidia’s AI mania provides new urgency to Biden’s goal of boosting US chip makers",
        "content": "Nvidia’s blockbuster results on Wednesday demonstrated the insatiable demand for semiconductors to power new AI systems, and the fear that supply may not be able to keep up.\n\nThat could make Washington’s goal of revitalizing US chip manufacturing in the years ahead even more pressing.\n\nThe Biden administration is currently in the early stage of a series of announcements about how it will spend $50 billion in taxpayer dollars in the coming years to help ensure that America is not left behind.\n\nOne big beneficiary is likely to be Intel (INTC), which is building a new factory in Ohio and is reportedly in talks for as much as $10 billion of that government money.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo made a virtual appearance at Intel Wednesday and declined to offer new details on what type of government grant the company might be in line for but underline her focus on AI.\n\n\"For you, frankly, it's a source of great upside and opportunity and customers,\" she told Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger at the event that also featured Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nOther major players in AI chip manufacturing, from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Micron (MU), are also expected to receive billions and are currently in talks with the government.\n\n\"These are intensive negotiations, we are in the thick of it now with our major applicants,\" a senior administration official said this week, promising further announcements would be coming within weeks. President Joe Biden delivers remarks about government regulations and artificial intelligence at the White House in October. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThus far, three smaller manufacturing awards have been promised to BAE Systems (BAESY), Microchip Technology and GlobalFoundries (GFS).\n\nThe administration also recently announced a likely award of $5 billion for the a public private consortium called the National Semiconductor Technology Center to quarterback the administration research efforts.\n\nAn effort to 'try to spread their bets'\n\nRaimondo oversees a team that has ballooned to more than 200 people charged with implementing the CHIPs and Science Act, legislation that was signed into law 18 months ago and designed to confront America's falling share of semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nRaimondo’s CHIPS Strategy Office is made up of scientists, supply chain and workforce specialists and others. The team is heavily focused, according to her department, on both immediate term goals but also planning for the potential impact of AI in the years ahead. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks during an announcement in 2022 that Intel will invest $20 billion to build two computer chip factories in Ohio, just east of Columbus. (AP Photo/Paul Vernon) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe administration is \"going to try to spread their bets a bit widely, which I think makes sense given that nobody knows what the industry will look like in a couple of years,\" says Christopher Miller, the author of a recent history of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe question is how much the US government can impact things in the crowded landscape. It will have to compete with China, which is also offering more generous government incentives, and perhaps burgeoning private efforts like Altman's goal, according to a Wall Street Journal report, of raising up to $7 trillion for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nThe plan has garnered a skeptical media and industry response both on whether such a project is possible as well as the tone Altman has taken. Altman recently posted an apparent reference to the project — and suggesting perhaps it could seek an even more astronomical sum — asking \"why not 8\" as well as a shorthand for an expletive.\n\nEither way, a wide range of officials agree that demand for AI chips will be high. On Wednesday, Raimondo referenced recent talks with Altman and others in the AI space noting \"the volume of chips that they project they need is mind-boggling, even if you take their projections and cut them in half.\"\n\n'Manufacturing is definitely the bottleneck'\n\nThe US is running behind. It produced nearly 40% of the world's chips in 1990 but less than 10% are made in the US today, according to the White House.\n\nThe situation is even worse with the world's most advanced semiconductors: 100% of those are currently manufactured overseas, mostly in Taiwan.\n\nTECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell says AI demand will \"organically\" lead to a new wave of chip research and design but restarting the manufacturing side may be aided by government's help.\n\n\"Chip manufacturing is definitely the bottleneck, and we're seeing it now,\" he says.\n\nThat point was echoed by Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang Wednesday when he discussed one of the few constraints on his quickly-growing business.\n\n\"We expect that demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides through the year,\" he told investors on his quarterly earnings call.\n\nNvidia partners with other companies when it comes to actually manufacturing its chip designs with TSMC the main manufacturer of Nvidia's most advanced chips.

(MOHD RASFAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MOHD RASFAN via Getty Images)\n\nCan AI be used to design more AI chips?\n\nIndustry figures and administration officials are also wrestling with the question of where the next generation of AI chips will be designed. This is an arena where the US is comfortably positioned at the moment but one that could be disrupted quickly.\n\nFor one thing, AI is already bringing a flood of new participants into chip designing business. Giants from Google (GOOG) to Amazon (AMZN) are already showing more interest as they seek designs to fuel their AI initiatives.\n\nArati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, recently addressed a roomful of industry representatives gathered at the White House and described the administration's overall approach as \"creating the transformative pathways that drive the technology forward but can also reshape the industry.\"\n\n\"We want to make sure that that happens in a way that creates advantage for our industry, but also advantage for America,\" she added.\n\nO'Donnell adds that AI itself could be used to design the next generation of chips noting that smaller companies like Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS) and Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) are hoping to utilize generative AI into their chip designs.\n\n\"It's going to help with perhaps coming up with more efficient chip designs,\" he says, adding \"right now it's a market dominated by NVIDIA, but it is not guaranteed to be that way in five years.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Watch Nvidia's Valuation as High Growth Set to Continue",
        "content": "Nvidia Corp.'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) valuation may look unappealing to some, but my peer analysis reveals only a moderate overvaluation at most. However, this needs to be monitored closely as the technology industry is prone to speculative prices. High growth is indicated by long-term artificial intelligence market expansion forecasts and, as such, I consider the stock worth holding long term.\n\nCompany overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows\n\nFounded in 1993, the company is a global leader in the design and manufacture of graphics processing units for the professional and gaming markets and system-on-a-chip (SoCs) units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. Watch Nvidia's Valuation as High Growth Set to Continue\n\nIt is best known for its GeForce GPUs, used for gaming, professional visualization and in data centers for high-performance computation. Nvidia's GPUs are also fundamental to the development and running of artificial intelligence models and it is accelerating machine and deep learning capabilities. It has also developed a platform called Drive, which is designed for autonomous vehicles, providing the computing power necessary for self-driving technology.\n\nIts Quadro GPUs are tailored for professionals needing design, visualization and simulation, aiding high precision and performance. Additionally, Nvidia's GeForce NOW platform and service is a cloud gaming infrastructure that allows users to stream games on various devices without requiring high-end hardware.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia develops software. For example, CUDA harnesses the power of GPUs for higher computing performance.\n\nThe company acquired Mellanox Technologies in 2020, adding networking and interconnect technology to its portfolio.\n\nFuture growth drivers and market outlook\n\nNvidia is a critical investment in long-term AI growth and major cutting-edge technologies. As such, understanding the broader market demands and growth outlook for its industry is crucial to assessing its valuation. My research proposes that Nvidia's growth may continue as the AI market expands and, as such, investors would be wise to hold the stock throughout present overvaluation concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nBloomberg reported that the AI industry could grow at a compound annual rate of 42% over the next 10 years, with demand for generative AI products adding about $280 billion of new software revenue. The research estimates a $1.30 trillion AI market by 2032. Here is a breakdown of what AI segments could be worth in 2032, as outlined by Bloomberg Intelligence:\n\nAI infrastructure as a service - $247 billion Digital ads driven by AI - $192 billion AI servers - $132 billion Specialized generative AI assistant software - $89 billion Conversational AI devices - $108 billion AI storage - $93 billion Computer vision AI products - $61 billion\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nConsidering the high CAGR anticipated for the AI market over the next decade, it is important to put Nvidia's historical growth in perspective to understand if the stock is rationally valued at this time.\n\nOver the past year, Nvidia has grown its earnings per share without non-recurring items at a rate of 173.20%, which is unprecedented historically considering its 10-year average of 34.30%. Watch Nvidia's Valuation as High Growth Set to Continue\n\nAlso consider free cash flow growth of 269.10% over the past year and 28.50% on average annually over the past 10 years: Watch Nvidia's Valuation as High Growth Set to Continue\n\nConsidering the broader trend in Nvidia's industry, arguably the fastest-growing market in the world, it may be possible for the company to maintain 20% or higher earnings per share growth over the next decade. Some reduction to past results is necessary to consider due to an already established business, even considering future market CAGR expectations. My earnings growth estimate is also roughly in line with the common consensus.\n\nValue analysis\n\nMy future growth estimate leads me to my analysis of the stock valuation. I consider Nvidia's price the most significant risk when investing in it at this time. The stock has a price-earnings ratio of around 96, which comes down to around 36 based on future earnings estimates. Its forward price-earnings ratio is in the bottom 30% of companies in the semiconductors industry.\n\nNvidia is evidently overvalued by traditional discounted cash flow analysis, but this method is unlikely to fully account for the premium that is usually attributed to high-tech stocks. Looking for leading advanced technology companies trading below fair value is often impossible. As such, I believe a peer analysis is the better way to gauge technology company valuations.\n\nI think Nvidia can correctly be compared to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nAMD forward price-earnings ratio of 52 Taiwan Semiconductor forward price-earnings ratio of 18 Broadcom forward price-earnings ratio of 27\n\nAs such, Nvidia does not seem unreasonably valued based on the stock price of its peers. However, it is likely there is a moderate overvaluation to consider, as indicated by the GF Value Line. Watch Nvidia's Valuation as High Growth Set to Continue\n\nConsidering future earnings estimates for the next three years, including 44 analysts on consensus expecting 72.32% year-over-year growth reported in January 2025 and 30 analysts expecting on consensus 24.24% growth in January 2026, the future for Nvidia looks like it might have the most upside potential in the next few years. However, investors may want to consider how the market will react when earnings growth comes down to more reasonable levels. It could continue to price the company at a premium, or more likely, the valuation will drop to a more reasonable level, creating some short-term volatility before the stock price begins to grow more conservatively.\n\nIt is also important to understand Nvidia's forward price-earnings ratio of around 36 at this time is considerably lower than its median price-earnings ratio of 43.50 over the last 10 years. That could present a reasonable buying opportunity right now as long as investors are willing to tolerate some future volatility. The medium-term potential instability in the price of the stock seems worth it, considering the large long-term expected market growth of AI and Nvidia's crucial function in this area. If the market presents a moderate price drop in the stock soon, that is when I will be looking to take my first proper stake in the company.\n\nGeopolitical risk\n\nNvidia is very closely related to Taiwan Semiconductor and, as such, remains significantly exposed to geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. surrounding Taiwan at this time. While an invasion of the country seems unlikely to me based on my ongoing analysis of international relations, investors must be cautious not to allocate too heavily to technology at this time. If a larger war breaks out, I believe technology stocks will be the most significantly negatively impacted, although the broader economic effects will reach all industries.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Nvidia still looks appealing to me. I would be cautious of allocating to the stock at this time too heavily, but even if bought at the present valuation, I believe long-term growth can still be expected over the next decade even if the stock experiences some volatility. My rating for the stock is a hold.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nNvidia did it again.\n\nThe company reported blowout numbers late Wednesday, squelching any anxiety growing among investors this week who feared the purest AI play in the market would fail to meet the moment. In premarket trading on Thursday, the stock rose as much as 13%.\n\nLast week, we noted some Wall Street analysts have worked overtime to properly analogize a story that is both a facsimile and the genuine object — a stock around which the entire market and its favorite meme, AI, revolves, and yet which has delivered the goods now for four quarters running.\n\nAnd while all the perspective some investors will need to understand Nvidia’s import to this rally comes from its stock price (up 300% since the start of 2023), Wednesday's fundamental update offers helpful — and more impressive — landmarks as well.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of its just-completed fiscal year, Nvidia’s data center segment, which realizes most of the demand for its high-end chips that power AI applications, saw revenue tally $18.4 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, the entire company’s revenue totaled $6.1 billion.\n\nNet income in its entire fiscal 2023 tallied $8.4 billion; in the fourth quarter of 2023, net income reached $12.8 billion. Its annual profits in 2024 reached $32.3 billion.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024, Nvidia's revenue grew 126% from the prior year; in the fourth quarter, revenue was up 265% from the prior year period. Net income on an annual basis rose 286%; in the fourth quarter, this measure of profits from 491% from the prior year period.\n\nIn its fiscal 2023, which ended in January 2023, Nvidia reported company-wide revenue of $27 billion. On Wednesday, Nvidia said revenue in the current quarter — the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025 — revenue should total $24 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeaning the amount of money coming in the front door per quarter is now about 90% of what came in for the entire year just one year ago.\n\nThe market cap gains and returns longer-term bulls have realized in Nvidia are gaudy, no doubt. But the results underpinning this hype more than hold their own. morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

Kress\n\nThanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year.\r\nStarting with Data Center. Data Center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached a tipping point of new computing era. The trillion-dollar installed base of Data Center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skywalk, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern Data Centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-on-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply.\r\nFourth quarter Data Center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our Data Center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference.\r\nBuilding and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale. Enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private cloud or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy.\r\nIn the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot Business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-on-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first 2 months than the 2 previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases.\r\nThe consumer Internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue.\r\nIn addition, consumer Internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. All the customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP, and Snowflake.\r\nThe field of foundation of large language models is thriving, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.AI, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world's many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion, pharmaceuticals and generative biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU-specialized cloud providers.\r\nJust this morning, we announced that we collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the-art new Gemma language model to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud, data center, and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as Automotive, health care, and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low-latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full-stack accelerated computing platform.\r\nWe estimate that Data Center revenue contribution of the Automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions include systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, curation, labeling, and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications.\r\nIn effect, nearly every Automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive Data Center processing demand to grow significantly.\r\nIn health care, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging, and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in health care over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara health care platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for the proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem.\r\nIn financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI.\r\nShifting to our Data Center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions except for China, where our Data Center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single-digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in Q4, and we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter.\r\nIn regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large language models in their own language on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems.\r\nFrom a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubled the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers.\r\nOur Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year-on-year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest-performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the Ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the Data Center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over Ethernet that are purpose-built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro with their global sales channels are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter.\r\nWe also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners.\r\nOkay, moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year-on-year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor Cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI TOPS, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\r\nThe rich software stack we offer with our RTX DPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, 7 out of 8 pixels can be AI-generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the TensorRT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large language models, generative AI can run up to 5x faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEM. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14-inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 TOPS of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best performing AI PC platforms.\r\nAt CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allow developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way.\r\nMoving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially, and up 105% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, Automotive, and robotics.\r\nIn Automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize workflows from design, to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers, including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like Lotus are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience.\r\nMoving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleet. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring, and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter. Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA.\r\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong Data Center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases.\r\nLet me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in Data Center and ProViz, partially offset by seasonal decline in Gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\r\nFiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.\r\nIn closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4; and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Health Care Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in person for the first time in 5 years. GTC will kick off with Jensen's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19.\r\nAt this time, we are now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nCongratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jensen on the Data Center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within Data Center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium- to long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that? And if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions. One more time? First question was...\n\nColette M. Kress\n\nOpenAI.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nI guess your expectations for Data Center, how they've evolved.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nOkay, yes. Well, you know we guide 1 quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth, calendar '24 to calendar '25 and beyond, and let me tell you why. We're at the beginning of 2 industry-wide transitions, and both of them are industry-wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you could tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from 4 to 6 years. There's just no reason to update with more GPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to.\r\nAnd so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20:1, huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. In generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it.\r\nAnd the third is, it is enabling a whole new industry. And this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at, and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time, a Data Center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of the company. We now have a new type of Data Center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory, and you've heard me describe it as AI factories.\r\nBut basically, it takes raw material, which is data. It transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA built, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible start-ups in digital biology generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on.\r\nAnd so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of Data Center. And this Data Center, we call it AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We're seeing diversity. One of the other reasons -- so the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, you know that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that are being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA's doing inferencing.\r\nThe inference part of our business has grown tremendously, we estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You could see from their CapEx and their discussions. But there's a whole new category called GPU-specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU-specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI.\r\nServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe, there's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI, so they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multibillion-dollar businesses: auto, health, financial services, in total, our vertical industries are multibillion-dollar businesses now.\r\nAnd of course, sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different, and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them. Each one of the regions around the world, the data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data, they want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation into AI and provision those services themselves.\r\nSo we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West will surely be replicated around the world. And these AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoseph Lawrence Moore\n\nI wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. It's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe the year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume it's, in some cases, the same GPUs are used for training and inference. How solid is that measurement?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nI'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated and -- but we estimated it, and let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, a year ago, the recommender systems that people are -- when you run the Internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because, as you know, the Internet has trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there, and your phone is 3 inches squared. And so the ability for them to fit all of that information down to something such a small real estate is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems.\r\nThese recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU accelerating for reranking. And it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. And as you know, a recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet.\r\nAlmost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe, these are all generative models. The list goes on. And none of these, as I just mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\n\nStacy Aaron Rasgon\n\nI wanted to -- Colette, I wanted to touch on your comments that you expected the next generation of products, I assume that the Blackwell to be supply constrained. Can you dig into that a little bit? What is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained? Like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25? Like when do those start to ease?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYes. The first thing is overall, our supply is improving. Overall, our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us. Everything from, of course, the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators to transceivers and networking and cables, and you name it, the list of components that we ship. As you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip, but the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated things we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason.\r\nIf you ever look at the back of the Data Center, the systems, the cabling system is mind-boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world has ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year-over-year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides, and through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best.\r\nHowever, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from 0 to a very large number, and you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a new generation of products and right now, we are ramping H200s, there's no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of Ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X, Ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system.\r\nBut with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of Ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation so that we could optimize Ethernet for AI. And so InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure, Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking, and that is ramping. So we'll -- with all new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products, and we work as fast as we can to catch up with the demand. But overall, net-net, overall, our supply is increasing very nicely.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen.\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\n\nCongrats on the results. I wanted to ask, I guess, a 2-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was getting at on your demand being significantly more than your supply even though supply is improving. And I guess the 2 sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of buildup of product that might not yet be turned on?\r\nAnd then I guess, Jensen, for you. I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about a thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller start-up companies to things in the health care arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling. And I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about \"fairly allocating\" sort of for the good of your company but also for the good of the industry.\n\nColette M. Kress\n\nLet me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally.\r\nSo they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that allocation and both helped us with our communications with them.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nFirst, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product road map and transitions. And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place and where and when. And so they know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities and, of course, allocation. We allocate fairly. We allocate fairly, do the best of our -- best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily.\r\nAs you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when a Data Center is not ready? Nothing is more difficult than to have anything sit around. And so allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. And where we do -- the question that you asked about the end markets, you know that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs, and very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the health care companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies, there's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging. There are warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies.\r\nAll of these start-ups -- large companies, health care, financial services, and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. And oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. And so this ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. But at the core of it, we want to allocate fairly with avoiding waste and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\n\nTimothy Michael Arcuri\n\nI wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments, but if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to take as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower? Or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog?\n\nColette M. Kress\n\nYes. So let me highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand, given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for.\r\nThe second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, component that we need for manufacturing but also often we are procuring capacity that we need. The length of that need for capacity or the length of the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next 2 quarters but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are predesigned to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need as several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward.\r\nSo wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long lead times or things that need a capacity to be built for us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nCongratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that it should go back to the mid-70s, if you don't mind unpacking that. And also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products? And what do you think are the drivers of that comment?\n\nColette M. Kress\n\nYes, thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks, really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those 2 quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefit from favorable component cost in the supply chain kind of across both our compute and networking, and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. So looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. So we're really looking at just a balance of our mix. Mix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year and those are really just the drivers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nChristopher James Muse\n\nBigger picture question for you, Jensen. When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nC.J., thanks for the question. Yes, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One is that it's accelerated, and two, it's programmable. It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally at the very beginning when CNNs and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through RNNs to LSTMs to every RLs to deep RLs to transformers to every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers that every single -- and now time sequence stuff. And every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base.\r\nThis is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor Cores, like our Transformer Engine for Tensor Cores, improve new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor Cores, meanwhile supporting the installed base at the same time. And so as a result, we take all of our new software algorithm inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand.\r\nOn the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary, like Transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper Transformer Engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better. So our customers' installed base is enriched over time with our new software.\r\nOn the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden, amazing breakthroughs in large language models were made possible. And those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand, we make giant breakthroughs on the other hand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nI wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in the prepared comments, you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also pointed out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single-digit percent of your total Data Center business. So I guess the question is, what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market? And why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that opportunity again?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nAt the core, remember, the U.S. government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. And the U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars, if you will, are the restrictions. And so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused, so that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. And that took some time. And so we reset our product offering to China, and now we're sampling to customers in China.\r\nAnd we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the specifications of the restriction. And so that's it. This last quarter, we -- our business significantly declined as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. But after that, hopefully, we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler.\n\nHarsh V. Kumar\n\nJensen, Colette and NVIDIA team, first of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about -- a little bit about your software business, and it's pleasing to hear that it's over $1 billion. But I was hoping, Jensen or Colette, if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business. In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nLet me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams, and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. And whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them, and their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams, and we enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing.\r\nAs you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing, SQL versus SQL structured data versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine learning to computer vision to speech to large language models, all -- recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries.\r\nIf you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now people understand that software is really key.\r\nAnd the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing, and when it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow, to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing, all of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem.\r\nSo we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market with it is think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system. It's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge $4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously, for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang, CEO, for closing remarks.\n\nJensen Huang\n\nThe computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand with increasing throughput while managing cost and energy. The incredible speed-up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world.\r\nWe are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this industrial revolution. Every company and every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI.\r\nGenerative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world data center infrastructure installed base in the next 5 years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions.\r\nThis new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer Internet companies. And now every industry is on board, from automotive to health care to financial services to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform with industry-specific application frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem gives us the speed, scale, and reach to help every company, to help companies in every industry become an AI company.\r\nWe have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose, so be sure to join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – have been the darlings of Wall Street for the past few years. And for good reason – they have dominated their markets and delivered outstanding returns for investors. However, their meteoric rise has pushed their valuations into the stratosphere. As an investor, I believe it’s prudent to take some chips off the table and redeploy that capital into other promising tech stocks that have not yet received their time in the spotlight.\n\nI will highlight seven terrific tech stocks that have been executing at a high level, but have mostly flown under the radar on Wall Street. Many of these stocks have the potential to generate triple-digit returns over the coming years. The best part? Most of these stocks can still be scooped up at reasonable valuations before the herd catches on. Let’s take a look!\n\nPriority Technology (PRTH) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a payments technology company, Priority Technology (NASDAQ:PRTH) is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable rebound in lending and borrowing once interest rates are cut. The entire fintech space remains depressed from the post-pandemic cooldown, but companies like PRTH that partner with banks or facilitate lending have huge upside when activity picks back up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPriority is already seeing promising progress on the financial front. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q3 to $189 million, and the company is getting close to breakeven profitability. While any profits right now may not be sustained, analysts expect Priority to hit its stride in 2025 with solid earnings growth. Importantly, the company’s balance sheet is healthy enough to fund losses until profitability scales.\n\nYes, Priority’s hefty debt load of $623 million is a concern with rising rates. But as rates inevitably fall, payments on this debt will decrease considerably, leading to much stronger profitability and a higher stock price. I’m bullish on Priority Technology’s ability to thrive as fintech rebounds. The company has an excellent payment platform and lending exposure to capitalize on renewed borrowing activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nFutu Holdings (FUTU) An iPhone screen displaying the Futu Holdings logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/Shutterstock\n\nFutu Holdings (NASDAQ:FUTU) has performed remarkably well as a digitalized brokerage platform, despite the recent market downturn. While the financial industry is still reeling from the post-pandemic hangover, companies like Futu will bounce back strongly once headwinds clear.\n\nCase in point – Futu achieved a stunning 36% dollarized revenue growth in Q3 to $338 million, with net margins of 46%. The company continues growing its user base rapidly, even amid weakness in the Chinese market. Investors are returning in droves, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs and the Nasdaq poised to follow. When the Chinese market finally wakes up, I expect Futu’s growth to accelerate tremendously.\n\nThe stock has traded sideways for more than three years after its parabolic surge. But this consolidation sets the stage for an upside breakout as market sentiment improves. Futu has proven its resilience and ability to rapidly monetize its user base. Once China stimulates its economy, the company should see user growth re-ignite.\n\nIn short, the company is firmly profitable, with margins expanding, and its growth story is far from over. Futu still has substantial room for international growth, and the ability to cross-selling financial products beyond stock trading. I’m bullish on this long-term compounder.\n\nRELX (RELX) A businesswoman looks at a floating interface screen full of data.\n\nSource: metamorworks/Shutterstock\n\nRELX (NYSE:RELX), a global analytics company, is firing on all cylinders with double-digit sales growth. The stock has surged 42% over the past year as fundamentals accelerated, but I think the company still has room to run as a premium quality business.\n\nSpecifically, RELX’s Exhibitions and Risk businesses have achieved stellar top-line growth of 32% and 8%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2023. Meanwhile, the company’s Scientific, Technical & Medical, and Legal divisions saw more modest but steady growth of 4%-6%.\n\nRELX’s Exhibitions and Risk units will likely drive near-term gains as RELX continues leveraging its unrivaled data assets. However, all four business lines have strong competitive positions that enable pricing power and reinvestment into new verticals.\n\nThe company’s valuation looks rich at first glance. But for a high-quality compounder like RELX, growth investors are wise to pay up. RELX consistently delivers organic growth with 19%-plus net margins and rising cash flows. As analytics adoption increases across industries, RELX has an open runway for expansion.\n\nTechTarget (TTGT) hand using online banking and icon on tablet screen device in coffee shop\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) operates an expansive network comprised of over 220 digital brands offering IT purchase intent data, research, and marketing services. Though shares currently sit around 70% off 2021 highs, the company’s recent combination with Informa’s digital business drastically expands TechTarget’s total addressable market by more than 10x.\n\nBeyond merger benefits, the company continues to execute well, with double-digit earnings and revenue growth pace expected again in 2024. Compared to richly-valued SaaS peers, TechTarget’s growth suggests upside from reasonable sub-20x earnings multiples. Pro forma estimates call for the combined entity to generate over $500 million in 2024 sales, expanding to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue within five years on 35%+ EBITDA margins. This consolidation also brings 50 million unique visitors.\n\nIf TechTarget can successfully harness merged assets to drive engagement with IT decision-makers, immense shareholder value could be unlocked, given the integral role purchase intent data plays in capturing trillion-dollar global IT spending.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nClaiming the #2 spot for U.S. dating app downloads behind Tinder in 2023, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) faces near-term headwinds like slowing user growth and leadership changes. However, the company’s long-term growth story remains intact. Bumble ranked ahead of Hinge. And its financials are strong, with high gross margins and double-digit revenue growth.\n\nStill, Bumble must effectively manage costs and continue scaling its user base amid a competitive online dating market. Recent stock dilution also weighs on the company’s share price. However, I see a compelling bargain for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue growth should average around 12% annually this decade. More importantly, Bumble’s earnings per share are expected to grow ffom 27 cents in 2023 to more than $1.45 in 2028. I believe Bumble deserves a higher premium, with profitability inflecting higher as online dating becomes normalized.\n\nChallenges exist, but Bumble retains leadership in a secular growth industry. The path forward is clear – drive monetization and engagement through new features while optimizing marketing costs. I’m bullish on Bumble regaining momentum and delivering substantial upside from current depressed levels.\n\nOpera (OPRA)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDelivering a unique web browser infused with messaging, crypto, and AI capabilities, Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) continues to gain share by targeting younger demographics—especially gamers. Last quarter, Opera beat guidance, with sales up 20% year-over-year to $103 million on surging profitability metrics. New Opera GX Cloud subscriptions also recently launched.\n\nDespite executing well into a $53 billion browser software market, the stock trades at a 58% discount to highs. It trades around 13-times forward earnings—presenting a compelling rebound opportunity as gamers plus smartphone users present adoption upside.\n\nBy integrating differentiated functionality like Twitch streaming and Discord messaging support, Opera’s ability to carve out enduring browser niche share seems continually underestimated to me. If conversion and monetization of its base exceeding 350 million users ramps successfully, material share price appreciation could follow over the long-term.\n\nQuickLogic (QUIK) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a small-cap semiconductor outfit developing embedded FPGA and edge AI solutions targeting high-potential markets like IoT and robotics, QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK) finds itself strategically aligned with surging AI adoption trends. With earnings per share potentially tripling next year amid a nearly 100% revenue growth pace, the stock likely warrants a higher premium than the 36-times earnings multiple 2024 projections imply.\n\nQuickLogic’s strengths in facilitating optimized AI inferencing on power-constrained endpoints perfectly position the company to enable the proliferation of AI use cases where data privacy and real-time responsiveness prove critical—a vital need in automation. With shares up over 131% in the past year on rapid adoption traction, I believe this undercovered name still seems significantly underestimated by the Street.\n\nIf the relentless focus on expanding its embedded FPGA IP capabilities boosts QuickLogic’s design win pipeline as projected entering 2024, immense shareholder value could be created given the immense TAM pursuing low-power AI innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia and Arm? This AI Stock Still Looks Cheap",
        "content": "Two of the biggest names in artificial intelligence (AI) of late have been chip powerhouses Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the former have soared 70% so far this year while the latter is coming off an exceptional 2023 during which its value skyrocketed by nearly 239% en route to making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. For investors looking to take advantage of the growth opportunities within AI, it may seem like it's too late to invest in the best players.\n\nBoth Arm and Nvidia are likely to keep growing, but investors may not be too keen on buying them at their current valuations. But not all AI stocks trade at a huge premium today. One that still looks relatively cheap is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC.\n\nIs TSMC an underrated AI play?\n\nTSMC is the world's leading third-party semiconductor foundry, and its business can benefit significantly from an uptick in demand for chips. The company projects that this year, its top line could grow by more than 20% as it benefits from strong demand for higher-end chips. CEO C.C. Wei sees the business playing a big role in the future of AI: \"We are a key enabler for AI applications. So far today, everything you saw for AI comes from TSMC.\"\n\nTSMC's projected revenue growth is encouraging. The company has been battling headwinds due to a slowdown in demand for consumer electronics, and AI could give it a much-needed growth catalyst. Its revenue for Q4 2023 totaled $19.6 billion -- down 1.5% year over year. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenue and profits were up 14% and 13%, respectively. The company does appear to be on a much stronger trajectory.\n\nTSMC's stock trades at an attractive valuation\n\nBased on analysts' expectations of future profits, TSMC's stock is fairly cheap, trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of just 20. That looks like a bargain compared to both Nvidia and Arm.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThere are, however, a couple of reasons investors may have chosen shares of Nvidia or Arm instead of TSMC. The first is that TSMC is based in Taiwan, so there's some geopolitical risk there to consider. That may be keeping investors away despite TSMC's potential.\n\nSecondly, the company recently pushed back the timelines on the new factories it is building in Arizona. TSMC is investing $40 billion to build two manufacturing facilities there. The first, originally intended to be operational in 2024, won't be until 2025 -- due, the company says, to its inability to find enough workers with the specialized skills the fab requires. The second fab now won't come online until 2027 or 2028; it was previously expected to be operational by 2026. While these factories are still being built, the delays may have dissuaded investors from investing in TSMC stock right now.\n\nShould you invest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing?\n\nWhether you're a frequent tech sector investor or are simply bullish on AI stocks, TSMC can be a great way to invest in technology. The semiconductor giant has been facing headwinds due to slowing consumer demand, but those aren't long-term issues. Once they subside, the company could benefit from both strong AI demand and a resurgence in demand for consumer electronics. In the long run, TSMC has the potential to join Nvidia and others in the $1 trillion market cap club.\n\nAt a relatively modest valuation, it could be one of the better AI stocks to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Back then Japanese firm's trailing price-to-earnings were averaging at about 60 times. Now the metric is a more sensible 16 times.\n\n\"Nvidia also came overnight and U.S. Q4 reporting season has been pretty strong overall. Basically companies have delivered,\" Nelson added.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of world shares wasn't quite able to score its own record but it wasn't far off, and U.S. futures were signaling solid gains for Wall Street later following Nvidia' stellar results.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt firm, which has been the most magnificent of the so-called Magnificent 7 set of global tech stocks, had forecast a roughly 233% surge in quarterly revenue, sending its shares up some 10% after-hours.\n\n\"U.S. futures are up, strong - that's just Nvidia, right there,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com.\n\n\"Equities more broadly are following in the slip stream.\"\n\nBIG IN JAPAN\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying some 5% each, driven in large part by mammoth expectations for artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia's chips at the centre of that boom.\n\nThursday record setting charge included Tokyo Electron jumping 6%, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest surged 7.5% and another chip-related share, Screen Holdings rallied more than 10%.\n\nBack in the bond markets it was all much more sedate.\n\nEuro zone yields drifted to multi-month highs as money markets scaled back their bets on European Central Bank rate cuts to less than 100 bps this year after Federal Reserve minutes showed its policymakers were concerned about moving too early.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield eased slightly in both European and Asian time to 4.30%, but remained close to the 4.332% level marked a week ago, which had not been seen since the end of November.\n\nWhile the bulk of Fed policymakers were concerned about the risks of cutting too soon there was still broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current lofty level.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe dollar continued to retreat from a three-month high reached last week, when the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, reached 104.97. It was down 0.3% at 103.86 with the euro up 0.3% at $1.0851, sterling at $1.2647 and the yen broadly flat at 150.15 per dollar.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices rose, adding to gains from the previous session that came amid signs of tighter supply.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) gained 25 cents to $78.16 a barrel, while Brent added 47 cents to $83.47 a barrel and gold was on a 7-day winning streak at $2,030 an ounce.

        "title": "11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best semiconductor stocks to invest in for the AI boom. If you want to skip our introduction covering how without the semiconductor industry, and how it's essential to the development of artificial intelligence, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom.\n\nEarlier this year, OpenAI's co founder and chief executive officer Sam Altman demonstrated his ability to remain in the news after he estimated that the total funding required to build an independent supply chain of semiconductors to fund all possible use cases for artificial intelligence could require $7 trillion in capital. Altman's talk with investors in the UAE reported by the Wall Street Journal involved his vision of a massive boost to global chip making foundries, energy, data centers, and other infrastructure required to sustain the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to fund artificial intelligence applications all over the world.\n\nWhile $7 trillion is more money than the annual economic output, or the GDP, of several countries, similar figures have been common in the semiconductor industry these past couple of months. In fact, it was semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang who stated during the firm's earnings call for the second quarter of its previous fiscal year:\n\nThe world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We’re seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it’s the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you’re seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuang and Altman's comments show that at least when some of the most influential persons in the high computing and semiconductor design industries are concerned, the global semiconductor industry can grow by the trillions of dollars.\n\nIn fact, on the day that Huang made the comments, NVIDIA's shares were trading in the $450 - $460 range, and had you believed him when he'd said that artificial intelligence and the broader advances in data center computing carry the potential to take his firm to new financial heights and bought NVIDIA's stock, then your investment would have delivered a price appreciation of roughly 45%.\n\nQuite impressive, but given that NVIDIA's stock is up by 230% over the past year, it does make one wonder where the rest of this growth comes from. Well, after its earnings press release for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 hit the wires, NVIDIA's shares gained 27% over the next couple of days. This was the first true surge in the semiconductor stock that is at the top of the food chain when we talk about artificial intelligence. Why did the shares jump more this time? Well, the press release saw Huang throw around the trillion dollar estimate for the first time.\n\nHowever, Huang and Altman are not the only semiconductor executives who have commented on artificial intelligence. In fact, since it's now become a major global phenomenon, managements of other semiconductor stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) have all weighed in. AMD's Su, whose firm is the only direct competitor to NVIDIA's products in non-Arm based GPU designs, believes that the artificial intelligence data center computing products market was worth $45 billion in 2023. Her remarks, made in December also shared the Santa Clara, California based chip designer's estimates that by 2027 end, this market will have grown to $400 billion.\n\nSimilarly, semiconductor stock TSMC's management confirmed that it had \"witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications\" in 2023. Likewise, Intel chief Patrick Gelsinger shared during the earnings call in January 2024 that not only had his firm witnessed \"the AI workload as a key driver of the $1 trillion semiconductor TAM by 2030, but that Intel is the only company \"able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.\"\n\nThe final bit of Gelsinger's comments is particularly important when we talk about semiconductor stocks that could benefit from AI-related tailwinds. This is because while chip stocks such as NASDAQ:NVDA, NASDAQ:INTC, NASDAQ:AMD, and NYSE:TSM are direct beneficiaries of the growth in AI, others like Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) can also benefit from booming AI demand as their products are indispensable when it comes to designing chips.\n\nToday, we'll talk about some such semiconductor stocks that hedge funds are buying in the era of artificial intelligence. 11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom\n\nClose-up of a robotic endoluminal surgery device performing a procedure in an operating room.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we ranked semiconductor stocks that are directly or indirectly exposed to artificial intelligence by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023. Out of these, the top semiconductor stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these top semiconductor stocks for the AI boom, we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That's why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom\n\n11. Analog Devices, Inc.

        "content": "AI-related crypto tokens have surged following Nvidia's earnings call. (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nCryptocurrencies related to the artificial intelligence sector have rallied over the past 24 hours, after Nvidia exceeded expectations with its Q4 earnings on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Coingecko data, the market capitalisation for artificial intelligence (AI) tokens now stands at $17.4bn (£13.73bn), which is an increase of 6.6% in the last 24 hours. This sector of the cryptocurrency ecosystem has outperformed the general crypto market, which has risen by only 1.3% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAI tokens associated with artificial intelligence projects, such as Fetch.ai, Singularity.net, and Render, all recorded gains in the last 24 hours. Singularity.net's AGIX token surged by over 38%, Fetch.ai's FET token saw an increase of almost 14%, and Render's RNDR token experienced a rise of over 20% during the same period.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) tokens are cryptocurrencies that power AI-related projects, such as AI-powered portfolio management, image generation, path finding, and more. AI tokens may give their holders governance rights on particular platforms, or they are needed to pay for transactions on these platform.\n\nThe surge in value of AI-related cryptocurrencies comes after Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday, that beating analysts' expectations.\n\nNvidia fourth quarter results\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. This exceeded the expectations of analysts that were anticipating earnings per share of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. Shares of Nvidia were up more than 5% following the report, but closed Wednesday, down 2.5% to $674.72.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement following the report.\n\nBitcoin price volatility increases\n\nThe price of bitcoin has held above the $51,000 mark for over one week, propelled by increased allocations from fund managers like BlackRock (BLK) and Franklin Templeton (BEN) into multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first US-listed ETFs to track bitcoin (BTC-USD) in January. A spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors anticipate could open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) stood at $51,806 (£40,808) at the time of writing. Price volatility over the past 24 hours has led to the liquidation of more than $38m in bitcoin positions over, with the majority, over $21m, consisting of long positions.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, the overall crypto market witnessed the liquidation of over $122m in long positions in the past 24 hours. This contributed to over $189m in total liquidations across major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWatch: Bitcoin ETFs poised for inflows from US pension plans, Standard Chartered analyst says | Future Focus\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped about 2% on Thursday after Nvidia's bumper results and forecast gave a fresh boost to the euphoria around artificial intelligence that has propelled Wall Street to record highs this year.\n\nNvidia's shares surged 12.9% in premarket trade after the chip designer forecast a roughly threefold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips.\n\nThe company, which also beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue, was set to add more than $200 billion in market cap.\n\nAt 4:29 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 69 points, or 0.18%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 52 points, or 1.04%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 331.5 points, or 1.89%.\n\nShares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped between 5.5% and 14.1%.\n\nBig Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta Platforms rose between 1.0% and 2.4%.\n\nNvidia's earnings had been a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street and some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks. Wall Street could notch fresh record highs in the near term if the momentum gathers pace.\n\n\"Few things are more certain than death, taxes and Nvidia beating on earnings.

Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices, server component supplier Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings jumped between 5.5% and 14.1%.\n\nBig Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta Platforms rose between 1.0% and 2.4%.\n\nNvidia's earnings had been a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street and some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks. Wall Street could notch fresh record highs in the near term if the momentum gathers pace.\n\n\"Few things are more certain than death, taxes and Nvidia beating on earnings. The bar was set quite high and incredibly they've once again stepped up and hit a home run,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group.\n\n\"(Nvidia's) AI business is simply booming more than even the most optimistic analyst expected.\"\n\nMeanwhile, investors stuck to bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in June after minutes from the central bank's latest meeting showed a majority of policymakers were concerned about the risks of easing policy too soon.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Goldman Sachs's investment portfolio and the top 12 penny stock picks. If you want to skip our overview of one of the most well known investment banks in the world, its recent predictions, and the general U.S. stock market climate, then you can take a look at Goldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nThe start of 2024 has been good for markets, in balance. The backbone of stock market performance is based on the U.S. economy, since if the economy is humming along, then businesses and consumers can have hope that their products will sell and they won't end up losing their jobs. This translates into broader optimism for investors, as they become more comfortable piling their money into the stock market instead of safe haven assets such as the U.S. dollar and gold.\n\nThese days, one particular segment that has seen renewed interest is the money market. Money market funds typically involve cash based securities such as certificates of deposit. At the start of 2024 as January ended, data from the banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) showed that by January 25th, money market funds added $75 billion to their value. This came at a time when such funds typically see investors move their money out, and it reflected market expectations about interest rate cuts. The lower the interest rate is, the lower interest investors have in such funds, and given the recent surge in technology stock valuations on the back of artificial intelligence, it appears that the trend witnessed by JPMorgan might be starting to reverse.\n\nThis is because according to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the week ending on Valentine's Day, $27.7 billion flowed into stocks and bonds, while $18.4 billion moved out of cash. These billions of dollars of money sloshing around the system, which was the highest for the previous eight weeks, also led to the impressive rise in the technology sector. Artificial intelligence stubbornly remains the major theme for stocks in 2024, and it has seen the valuations of firms such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rise significantly over the course of the past year. BofA's data shows that the Magnificent 7 group of stocks, a list made of other big ticket and high profile technology stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), have pocketed 140% in gains over the past 12 months - a level similar to the 150% gain that the Nifty 50 marked in the 1970s on the U.S. stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, as we talk about Goldman Sachs's top penny stock picks, it's important to note that when it comes to the stock market, the bank is resoundingly optimistic about the stock market's performance in 2024. Its latest year end target for the flagship S&P 500 stock index sits at 5,200, a significant upgrade from an earlier target of 4,700 points. Mind you, the index has already reached these levels in 2024 as we exit February, and it pared back its gains only after multiple signals dented hopes of an early interest rate cut.\n\nThis bit is important even when we talk about penny stocks. After all, when we talk about the thousands of stocks that trade on markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE, penny stocks offer the highest odds of robust double and triple digit percentage returns. This means that broader market optimism at times when major indexes like the S&P 500 are rising also means that these stocks have the potential to be lifted by the rising wave too. For instance when we consider stocks that have delivered close to, or higher than triple digit percentage returns in 2024, the absolute majority turn out to be penny stocks. Some such penny stocks that have delivered strong price returns in 2024 are Beamr Imaging Ltd. (NASDAQ:BMR) and MicroCloud Hologram Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLO). The latter is a Chinese company developing holographic technology, and the former is an Israeli company that provides video encoding and other associated software products.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of Goldman Sachs's top penny stock picks. Within this list, a handful of top contenders are iQIYI, Inc. (NASDAQ:IQ), Ambev S.A. (NYSE:ABEV), and Banco Bradesco S.A. (NYSE:BBD). Goldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks\n\nRoman Tiraspolsky/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs's top penny stocks, we ranked all the stocks in the bank's Q4 2023 investment portfolio by the average share price during the quarter. Then, the ones with an average share price less than $5 were re-ranked by the dollar value of Goldman's position. Finally, the penny stocks with the greatest investment were chosen as Goldman Sachs's top penny stock picks.\n\nFor these top Goldman Sachs penny stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nGoldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks\n\n12. Gaotu Techedu Inc.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023, investors have enjoyed a true running of the bulls on Wall Street. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average and broad-based S&P 500 galloped to fresh highs, while the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite ended the previous week a stone's throw from eclipsing its November 2021 record-closing high.\n\nWhile I'd love to tell you that this has been a broad-driven rally, the emergence of a new bull market is the result of outsized returns from the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to some of the largest, most influential businesses on Wall Street:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese are seven innovation-driven businesses that offer an abundance of competitive advantages. Examples include Alphabet's virtual monopoly in internet search with Google; Microsoft's continued dominance with its Windows operating system; Tesla's position as North America's leading electric vehicle manufacturer; Amazon's dominant e-commerce marketplace; and Meta's top social media assets, which attract nearly 4 billion active users each month.\n\nWhile the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven isn't lost on Wall Street, its most successful money managers have very different outlooks on these top-tier stocks, as evidenced by the latest round of 13F filings. A 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's brightest minds bought and sold in the latest quarter.\n\nBased on 13Fs for the December-ended quarter, three Magnificent Seven stocks were given the heave-ho by billionaire investors, while another was aggressively purchased.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires are selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock that was sent to the chopping block in the fourth quarter is social media giant Meta Platforms. A half-dozen billionaire money managers lightened their respective fund's stakes in the parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nStory continues\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (3,037,082 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,430,767 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (542,399 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (371,850 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (307,709 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (100,000 shares)\n\nThe most logical reason for billionaires to be wary of Meta is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in 2024. Meta generates almost 98% of its revenue from advertising on its social media platforms, and it's perfectly normal for advertisers to reduce their spending during periods of economic weakness. A recession would hurt Meta's sales and its ad-pricing power in the short run.\n\nThe other potential concern for billionaires might be Meta's valuation. Shares of the company have more than quintupled in value from their 2022 bear market low. Billionaires selling could represent simple profit-taking, or perhaps signal that top asset managers anticipate a short-term pullback in Meta stock.\n\nHowever, the interesting thing about Meta is that it's still historically cheap, even after its run-up. Shares of the company are valued at 12.6 times forecast cash flow in 2025, which represents a nearly 20% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires are selling: Alphabet\n\nA second Magnificent Seven stock that got the boot from billionaire asset managers in the December-ended quarter is Alphabet. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud saw seven billionaires sell its stock, including (total shares sold in parentheses for Alphabet's Class A shares, GOOGL):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (3,302,342 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (3,113,001 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,278,300 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (806,651 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (571,317 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (236,969 shares)\n\nSimilar to Meta, the exodus among billionaires from Alphabet may have to do with concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. A few money-based metrics and predictive indicators have been blaring warnings that U.S. economic activity could weaken. Alphabet brought in about 76% of its net sales in 2023 from advertising on Google search, Google Network, and YouTube.\n\nAnd just like Meta, the selling doesn't seem to make much sense. In addition to periods of growth disproportionately outlasting recessions, Alphabet's Google accounts for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share, as of January. In fact, you have to look back nearly nine years to find the last time a month went by where it didn't account for at least 90% of global internet search. Alphabet's ad-pricing power is practically unsurpassed.\n\nAlphabet also completed its first year of operating profitability from its high-margin cloud infrastructure services segment. Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending and shouldn't have any trouble meaningfully increasing its cash flow in the years to come.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 3 billionaires are selling: Nvidia\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that had billionaires willingly pressing the sell button during the fourth quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia. All told, eight billionaires were sellers of the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne of the prime reasons billionaire investors may have rushed for the exit is growing graphics processing unit (GPU) competition. Not only is Nvidia going to fend off increasing competition from external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, but many of Nvidia's top customers are developing their own AI chips, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nThere's also a real possibility that Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands its production of A100 and H100 AI-GPU chips. A modest increase in cost of revenue compared to an 86% jump in sales through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January) pretty clearly demonstrates how powerful Nvidia's pricing power has been. Once this GPU scarcity wanes, its gross margin is liable to decline.\n\nLastly, every next-big-trend over the past three decades has worked its way through an early-stage bubble. History suggests that investors will overestimate the uptake of AI, just as they have with every previous next-big-thing trend for 30 years.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire money managers can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nThere was, however, one Magnificent Seven stock that didn't have billionaires abandoning ship. During the December-ended quarter, eight billionaires gobbled up shares of e-commerce company Amazon, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe lure of Amazon for billionaires is that its business isn't as reliant on e-commerce as you might think. Although e-commerce accounts for a sizable percentage of Amazon's sales, online retail sales are low margin. If the U.S. economy were to stumble and online retail sales tapered off, it won't have much impact on Amazon's cash flow.\n\nBy comparison, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income from its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was responsible for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending in the third quarter of 2023. As long as AWS continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, Amazon's cash flow can motor substantially higher.\n\nDespite a huge rally in its share price, Amazon remains inexpensive, relative to its cash flow. The reason I'm using cash flow, as opposed to the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, is because Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business. After ending every year of the 2010s at a multiple of between 23 and 37 times its cash flow, Amazon shares can be picked up right now for a little over 12 times forecast cash flow in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

The index eased from session highs and was last up 0.6%.\n\nThe technology sector drove gains with a 2.8% rise as investors cheered Nvidia's results and forecast. Frankfurt-listed shares of the artificial intelligence bellwether jumped 13.7%.\n\nBESI semiconductor surged 16.6% to hit a record high after the Dutch chipmaking equipment supplier exceeded fourth-quarter targets on demand for AI-related chipmaking parts.\n\nThe technology index has jumped 12.5% so far this year and is trading at more than 23-year highs on the back of upbeat earnings from industry leaders SAP and ASML Holding which have also received a boost from the AI frenzy.\n\n\"Communications and information technology sectors have done quite well and they've been achieving the strongest earnings beats so far,\" said Aneeka Gupta, director of macroeconomic research at WisdomTree.\n\n\"Growth oriented sectors are flourishing at a time when growth in the eurozone is quite anaemic and hence they are trading at a premium.\"\n\nBucking the trend, the food and beverages index dropped 0.9%, bogged down by a 3.4% loss in Nestle after the world's biggest packaged food company reported full-year organic sales growth slightly below expectations as price hikes prompted some shoppers to turn to competing brands.\n\nStory continues\n\nDelivery Hero lost 8.6% after the food delivery firm said talks for the potential sale of its foodpanda business in selected markets in Southeast Asia have been terminated.\n\nOn the data front, euro zone business activity improved in February as the dominant services sector broke a six-month streak of contraction, offsetting a deterioration in manufacturing, a survey showed.\n\nInvestors are now looking out for January's final eurozone inflation print and the ECB's policy meeting minutes as investors scour for clues on interest rate cuts.\n\nMercedes-Benz rose 4.8% as the luxury automaker reported a 'solid' set of full-year results and announced a share buyback program of up to 3 billion euros ($3.26 billion).\n\nUK's Indivior led gains on STOXX 600 with a 18.5% jump after the pharmaceuticals firm forecast annual revenue above estimates.\n\nShares in Accor advanced 4.0% following a bigger-than-expected jump in Europe's biggest hotel group's annual core profit, and an upbeat forecast for 2024.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Nvidia shares climbed 12% before the bell on Thursday as booming demand for its AI chips helped the company forecast quarterly revenue much above Wall Street's lofty expectations, lifting AI and tech stocks globally.\n\nThe top chip supplier was set to add more than $230 billion to its market value, taking it closer to $2 trillion for the first time and reclaiming its spot as Wall Street's third most valuable firm.\n\nGains in Nvidia lifted aspiring AI competitor Advanced Micro Devices 5.7%, while Super Micro Computer climbed 14.4% and Arm Holdings rose 9.5%. The iShares semiconductor ETF added 4.3%.\n\nSoaring demand for Nvidia's chips used by companies rushing to upgrade their AI offerings helped the Silicon Valley firm, forecast first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 208% rise.\n\nThe midpoint of the forecast was $24 billion, which was above market expectations of $22.17 billion.\n\n\"Nvidia continues to deliver in every way, and its results show there is still plenty of growth ahead. This isn't just a flash in the pan, nor a bubble, but a business that continues to make serious cash,\" said Josh Gilbert, Market Analyst at eToro.\n\nExpectations heading into the results were very high, with shares Nvidia surging nearly 36% this year to become the best performing S&P 500 stock and notching a record high just last week.\n\nThe share surge that fueled S&P 500's climb to record highs this year had sparked fears that growth at Nvidia, the bellwether for AI demand, could disappoint and potentially disrupt the market rally.\n\nThe overnight rally in chip stocks added 1.9% to Nasdaq 100 futures and lifted Wall Street futures, while Japan's Nikkei share average surged to a record high, eclipsing the 1989 bubble-era peak.\n\nNvidia was last trading at $767, on track to hit a record high at market open.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Samuel Indyk in London; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Arun Koyyur)",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best falling stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe start of the year has seen some stocks perform well and the broader market comes to terms with the fact that the Federal Reserve might not have any other option apart from keeping interest rates higher for longer. Recent data sets for the U.S. economy show that inflation is still a threat, and while the American economy has surpassed all expectations by managing to avoid a recession, globally, the picture isn't rosy. Europe's two major economies, the United Kingdom and Germany, have both entered into recessions, and the Chinese economic giant is in no mood to return to its pre pandemic trajectory either.\n\nYet, since the inflationary situation is no longer as dire as it was at the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, stock market investors can still take some relief in knowing that their investments will not turn sour. The right stocks, such as those belonging to high growth areas such as computing, artificial intelligence, and space exploration, have posted impressive returns in 2024 despite the fact that we're less than two months into the year.\n\nFor instance, shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the hottest artificial intelligence stock in today's age, are up by 251% over the past 12 months and 50% year to date. And if you thought that only AI stocks were seeing love on the stock market, then you'd be surprised. This is because 2024 has provided a surprise boost to space stocks, as the shares of Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) have soared by a whopping 210% year to date.\n\nThese returns are why the stock market is one of the most preferred investing vehicles for all kinds of investors. Intuitive's shares have provided triple digit percentage returns in less than two months because of the strong performance of its IM-1 mission. The IM-1 involves Intuitive's Nova-C Odysseus lunar lander which started off its lunar journey in February with the landing due on the 22nd. Odysseus, named after a Greek mythological figure, has sent Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR)'s shares out of the penny stock category since a successful landing will kick off NASA's Artemis program - a multi billion dollar initiative that seeks to establish a presence on the Moon this decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while some stocks are up, others are falling. The regional banking sector in particular has been at the center of the wrong kind of attention in 2024. Its turmoils have been triggered by the troubled office real estate market, whose debt investors have had to deal with the impact of record high interest rates on their sizeable portfolios.\n\nSince the year is still young, there are only a few sizeable and important stocks that are near triple digit lows on the market. And these stocks are falling because of their fundamentals rather than broader, market driving trends. For instance, one falling stock whose shares haven't seen much love in 2024 belongs to the highly growing and catchy electric vehicle industry. Shares of the Brazilian lithium exploration firm Sigma Lithium Corporation (NASDAQ:SGML) are down by 51% year to date in the wake of falling global lithium prices. Lithium carbonate prices in China plummeted by 74% from November 2023 to the start of the second week of February, and naturally, investors were wary of holding Sigma Lithium's shares during such a turbulent time period.\n\nFinally, in such an environment where stocks lose their value due to underlying business or industry trends, one might be inclined to see what the smart money is doing. We've done this today and made a list of falling stocks that are seeing interest from hedge fund investors. Some notable names on the list are Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PACB), QuidelOrtho Corporation (NASDAQ:QDEL), and Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD). 13 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best falling stocks, we first ranked all stocks that have lost 25% or more on the stock market this year and touched 52 week lows. Then, we ranked the falling stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares as of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nFor these best falling stocks according to hedge funds, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n13.

        "title": "11 Best Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best small-cap growth stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our primer about the benefits and drawbacks of investing in small cap stocks, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Invest In.\n\nThe small cap sector of the stock market gets significantly lower coverage than compared to mega caps such as Apple and Microsoft. This is understandable since the latter category of stocks are of big companies that are global brand names. However, the sizeable nature of mega caps renders them weak when we consider the potential for returns. While there are some exceptions, higher share prices mean that not only is a stock less likely to make high double or triple digit percentage returns, but also since the stock is too expensive, there will be limited liquidity despite the fact that several shares are also sold in units.\n\nOn the flip side, small cap stocks, which are those with a market capitalization less than $2 billion, come with their own set of risks. These are smaller firms, with balance sheets unlikely to cross a billion dollars in total assets. Naturally, their size is due to the fact that when compared to firms such as the semiconductor firm AMD or the consumer defensive retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), small cap stocks often have markets that are geographically limited.\n\nA great example of this bifurcation in market size that also contributes to sizeable differences in market value is the financial services industry. With this industry, we have large caps such as the world's largest private bank in terms of assets, the New York City banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) as well as small cap banks such as the Miami Lakes, Florida based regional bank BankUnited, Inc. (NYSE:BKU). The sizeable difference in these two banks, which both belong to the same industry but only the latter is a small cap stock is clear when we look at their total assets as of December 2023. JPMK503B\n\nStory continues\n\nFor JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank had unbelievable total assets of a stunning $3.6 trillion - larger than the assets of several countries. On the other hand, BankUnited's balance sheet totaled at $37 billion - or less than the total value of Elon Musk's Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stake.\n\nSince investing in stocks is all about returns, the next step when analyzing small cap stocks is to see how their performance differs from large or mega cap behemoths. After all, the fact that JPMorgan's market capitalization sits at $504 billion while UnitedBank is worth $1.99 billion ought to influence returns in some way. Well, continuing with our take on the financial services small cap stocks, in terms of 12 month percentage share price gains, the top three financial services stocks as of recent share price performance are American Coastal Insurance Corporation (NASDAQ:ACIC), Prairie Operating Co. (NASDAQ:PROP), and CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK). Their shares have appreciated by 961%, 336%, and 374% over the past twelve months, in a nice set of results that eclipse the gains of the magnificent seven A.I. semiconductor stock darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nYet, when we look at the share price appreciation of large cap stocks in the financial services industry, the top three performers are Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Nu Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU), and First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA). Their share prices are up by 151%, 103%, and 93% over the past twelve months - confirming that small caps pack quite a punch in delivering returns. The significant difference in returns might be due to the fact that when valuations were accounted for, small caps were trading at a two decade high discount compared to large caps.\n\nHowever, while the picture for price gains in small cap stocks is rosy, it comes with its own set of caveats. For instance, these companies often might face liquidity issues that could see the shares experience limited trading. Or, untoward economic events such as a recession or a crisis in the regional banking industry can dent their shares and wipe out the principal invested.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best small cap stocks that hedge funds are piling into. Within this list, the notable small cap names are ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON), Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBIX), and Flex Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLEX). 11 Best Small-Cap Growth Stocks to Invest In\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best small cap stocks, we ranked the 100+ holdings of the Janus Henderson Triton Fund by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best magic formula stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nConsidering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.\n\nOne investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades.\n\nHowever, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods.\n\nLike some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money.\n\nIn Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors.\n\nSo what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). 11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRommel Canlas/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy now, we scanned the Q4 2023 investment portfolio of Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management and picked out the top holdings in U.S. dollar terms.\n\nFor these best magic formula stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "(Updates prices as of 0600 GMT, adds analysts' comments)\n\nBy Kevin Buckland\n\nTOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average topped its all-time peak on Thursday, after unexpectedly strong revenue forecasts from U.S. chip designer Nvidia lifted Asian tech stocks.\n\nChinese equities recovered from early weakness and looked set to extend a winning run to an eighth straight session amid optimism over Beijing's stimulus efforts.\n\nLong-term U.S. bond yields hugged three-month highs while the dollar sagged after minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting confirmed the view that interest rate cuts would be slow in coming, but weren't markedly more hawkish than the Fed's previously expressed views.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 share average closed 2.19% higher at 39,098.68, and earlier rose as high as 39,156.97, topping the previous all-time closing and intraday highs set on Dec. 29, 1989, at the peak of the so-called bubble economy.\n\n\"Given robust corporate earnings without frothy valuations reminiscent of the last time Japanese equities were this high, a weakening yen backdrop, along with the market responding well to the government's tilt towards greater corporate governance, it's little surprise that investor sentiment remains very positive and Japanese equities continue to surge,\" said Joe Lin, executive director for investments at Golden Equator Wealth.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.56%, helped by gains of around 1% for both Taiwan's stock benchmark and Hong Kong's Hang Seng , which rebounded sharply after early losses.\n\nMainland blue chips were last up 0.61%, after oscillating during the session between small gains and losses in early trading.\n\nU.S. stock index futures signalled solid gains, following a mixed session on Wednesday for the main benchmarks. S&P 500 futures rallied 0.75% and tech-focused Nasdaq futures jumped 1.46%.\n\nFollowing the closing bell overnight, Nvidia forecast a roughly 233% surge in quarterly revenue, sending its shares up some 10% after-hours.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"U.S. futures are up, strong - that's just Nvidia, right there,\" said Kyle Rodda, senior markets analyst at Capital.com.\n\n\"Equities more broadly are following in the slip stream.\"\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped nearly 17% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying some 5% each, driven in large part by mammoth expectations for artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia's chips at the centre of that boom.\n\n\"Nvidia's earnings beat boosted sentiment and eased concerns over stretched valuations, providing room for the AI theme to continue to drive markets,\" Saxo Markets analysts wrote in a research note.\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield eased slightly in Asian time on Thursday to 4.3069%, but remained close to the 4.332% level marked a week ago, which had not been seen since the end of November.\n\nThe bulk of policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting in January were concerned about the risks of cutting interest rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level, minutes released on Wednesday showed.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe dollar continued to retreat from a three-month high reached last week, when the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, reached 104.97. It was down 0.12% at 103.86 in Asian trading on Thursday.\n\nThe euro ticked up 0.14% to $1.08345, and sterling added 0.08% to $1.2647, whereas the yen was flat at 150.275 per dollar.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices rose, adding to gains from the previous session that came amid signs of tighter supply.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) gained 25 cents to $78.16 a barrel, while Brent added 24 cents to $83.27 a barrel.\n\nOil prices rose 1% on Wednesday, with refinery restarts in the United States supporting demand after a series of outages earlier cut U.S. refinery utilisation rates to the lowest level in two years.\n\n(Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Christopher Cushing)",

        "title": "GRAPHIC: Nvidia’s growing sway over U.S. stock market",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp, leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.\n\nThe semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.\n\nGiven the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.\n\n“The response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia’s performance. “If Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.”\n\nNvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That’s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market’s key drivers over the past year.\n\nNvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.\n\nThe company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the S&P 500. As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.\n\nRapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.\n\nThe company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.\n\nNvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm or Comcast.\n\nNvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.\n\nOptions wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia’s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.\n\nEven beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich; additional reporting by Suzanne McGee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Stephen Coates)",

        "content": "(Repeats no change to text) * Taiwan stocks rise 1.1% to record high * S.Korea holds policy rate * Singapore and Malaysia Jan CPI due on Friday By Ayushman Ojha Feb 22 (Reuters) - Equities in Taiwan and South Korea rose on Thursday as chip-related stocks jumped after U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's outlook beat expectations, while currencies were largely subdued as Federal Reserve's minutes cemented bets it won't cut rates soon. Taiwan shares rose as much as 1.1% to hit a fresh all-time high, while stocks in South Korea added as much as 0.7%. Nvidia on Wednesday forecast a roughly threefold surge in quarterly revenue that handily beat estimates on towering demand for its industry-leading artificial-intelligence chips. Other stock markets were mixed, with Thailand stocks gaining as much as 0.5%, while Malaysian shares lost 0.5%. Currencies in the region remained tepid after minutes of Fed's Jan. 30-31 meeting showed that policymakers were concerned about the risks of cutting interest rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level. The Malaysian ringgit was largely flat, and trading at lows not seen since the Asian Financial Crisis as outflows, foreign currency hoarding and a strong dollar pile on pressure. It touched 4.801 to the dollar on Wednesday, its weakest since January 1998. \"Some of the drivers of ringgit weakness are temporary. We expect the USD to weaken once the Fed eventually cuts rates, providing respite for the ringgit,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. In South Korea, the central bank left interest rates at a 15-year high amid signs that the weaker economy is slowing inflation. Recent inflation prints in Asian economies have shown easing price trends, giving central banks some breathing room. This comes a day after Indonesia's central bank also kept policy rates steady, as expected, and reiterated it would likely have room to cut borrowing costs in the second half of the year. In line, Thailand's central bank is ready to adjust rates if the economy and inflation changes significantly, minutes of its Feb. 7 policy meeting showed. Earlier, Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had again urged the central bank to cut interest rates before the next scheduled meeting. Although, investors focus remains on the timing of the policy easing in Southeast Asia. China's recent policy decision to slash its five-year loan prime rate by 25bps can be one example for other central banks to reduce policy rates as domestic economic growth tends slow, analysts at Maybank said. South Korean won appreciated 0.3%, while Indonesian rupiah inched 0.2% higher. The investors cautiously await January inflation data from Malaysia and Singapore, both due on Friday.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland\n\nIf Nvidia's eye-popping revenue forecasts were meant to keep the AI fervour pumping money into already-heated tech shares, it was hard to see it anywhere but in Japan on Thursday.\n\nThe Nikkei overcame some early nerves to finally surge as much as 2% to a record high above 39,000, putting it in blue sky territory after a 34-year gap from its previous \"bubble\" era peak.\n\nBut Chinese stocks struggled, with some exhaustion likely setting in after a seven-day winning stretch inspired by Beijing's stimulus measures. A subindex of Hang Seng tech shares has notably spent the day so far in the red.\n\nChinese hedge funds have been scrambling to soothe investor nerves after the slump in shares to five-year lows at the start of the month.\n\nNvidia's impact on the Wall Street reopen isn't in question though, with Nasdaq futures pointing 1.5% higher, after a lacklustre day of trading on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean traders also have a fairly lengthy list of macro indicators to look forward to, with PMIs from Germany, France and the euro zone as a whole, as well as from Britain. The euro area also has final readings for consumer inflation in January.\n\nThe euro and sterling have outperformed the dollar and yen over the past week, with traders betting the ECB and Bank of England will be later than the Fed in cutting rates, while the Bank of Japan moves with extreme caution on rate hikes.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield remains elevated at above 4.3%, but below the 4.4% level that some analysts flag as the threshold for a flare-up in equity market jitters.\n\nA smaller pool of earnings today, but Nestle's could shed light on how tight consumers' purse strings are.\n\nIn Britain, Lloyds and Anglo American are due to report.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n\n-Flash PMIs for Germany, France, euro zone and UK (all Feb)\n\n-Final HICP for euro zone (Jan)\n\nStory continues\n\n-Earnings from Nestle, Lloyds, Anglo American\n\n-US initial jobless claims, flash PMIs (Feb), existing home sales (Jan)\n\n(Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Kevin Buckland\n\nIf Nvidia's eye-popping revenue forecasts were meant to keep the AI fervour pumping money into already-heated tech shares, it was hard to see it anywhere but in Japan on Thursday. The Nikkei overcame some early nerves to finally surge as much as 2% to a record high above 39,000, putting it in blue sky territory after a 34-year gap from its previous \"bubble\" era peak.\n\nBut Chinese stocks struggled , with some exhaustion likely setting in after a seven-day winning stretch inspired by Beijing's stimulus measures. A subindex of Hang Seng tech shares has notably spent the day so far in the red.\n\nChinese hedge funds have been scrambling to soothe investor nerves after the slump in shares to five-year lows at the start of the month.\n\nNvidia's impact on the Wall Street reopen isn't in question though, with Nasdaq futures pointing 1.5% higher, after a lacklustre day of trading on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean traders also have a fairly lengthy list of macro indicators to look forward to, with PMIs from Germany, France and the euro zone as a whole, as well as from Britain. The euro area also has final readings for consumer inflation in January.\n\nThe euro and sterling have outperformed the dollar and yen over the past week, with traders betting the ECB and Bank of England will be later than the Fed in cutting rates, while the Bank of Japan moves with extreme caution on rate hikes.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield remains elevated at above 4.3%, but below the 4.4% level that some analysts flag as the threshold for a flare-up in equity market jitters.\n\nA smaller pool of earnings today, but Nestle's could shed light on how tight consumers' purse strings are.\n\nIn Britain, Lloyds and Anglo American are due to report.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n\n-Flash PMIs for Germany, France, euro zone and UK (all Feb)\n\n-Final HICP for euro zone (Jan)\n\nStory continues\n\n-Earnings from Nestle, Lloyds, Anglo American\n\n-US initial jobless claims, flash PMIs (Feb), existing home sales (Jan)\n\n(Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

        "content": "Robust revenue growth with a 126% increase year-over-year, reaching $60.9 billion in FY 2024. Significant expansion in the Data Center segment, with a 217% increase in revenue. Operational excellence reflected in increased gross margins and comprehensive income. Strategic positioning in key markets: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), a trailblazer in graphics processing units and a vanguard of artificial intelligence technology, released its 10-K filing, revealing a transformative year. The company's financials underscore its robust performance, with a staggering 126% increase in revenue to $60.9 billion, compared to the previous year. NVIDIA's strategic pivot towards data centers and AI has paid dividends, as evidenced by the 217% surge in Data Center revenue. The company's gross profit soared to $44.3 billion, reflecting operational efficiency and market demand for its innovative products. With a comprehensive income of $29.83 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93, NVIDIA's financial health is formidable, setting the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis. Decoding NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Leadership in Data Center and AI: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has cemented its position as a leader in the Data Center and AI markets. The company's revenue from this segment skyrocketed by 217% in FY 2024, reaching $47.5 billion. This growth is driven by the launch of AI inference platforms and the introduction of NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations, which cater to the burgeoning demand for generative AI and large language models. NVIDIA's dominance is further evidenced by its GPUs and networking solutions powering over 75% of the supercomputers on the global TOP500 list, including 24 of the top 30 systems on the Green500 list. This strength not only showcases NVIDIA's technological prowess but also its ability to capture and lead high-growth markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Robustness: NVIDIA's financial performance in FY 2024 is a testament to its strength. The company's revenue growth to $60.9 billion, coupled with a gross profit of $44.3 billion, reflects its ability to scale and capitalize on market opportunities effectively. NVIDIA's net income of $29.76 billion and a diluted net income per share of $11.93 underscore its profitability and financial stability. This financial robustness provides NVIDIA with the capital necessary to invest in research and development, expand its product offerings, and pursue strategic acquisitions, further solidifying its market position.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSupply Chain Concentration: Despite its financial success, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces potential risks associated with its supply chain. The company's manufacturing operations are heavily concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, relying on foundries such as TSMC and Samsung. This concentration could expose NVIDIA to geopolitical risks, trade tensions, and supply chain disruptions, which could impact its ability to deliver products consistently and at competitive prices. Diversifying its supply chain could mitigate these risks and ensure more stable operations.\n\nDependence on Third-Party Suppliers: NVIDIA's fabless manufacturing strategy means it depends on third-party suppliers for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. While this allows NVIDIA to focus on design and innovation, it also reduces control over product quantity, quality, and delivery schedules. Any disruptions or defects from suppliers could harm NVIDIA's business and reputation. Strengthening relationships with suppliers and building redundancy in the supply chain are crucial to minimizing these weaknesses.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion into New Markets: NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has the opportunity to leverage its AI and GPU technologies to expand into new markets. The company's expertise in AI is applicable to a wide range of industries, including healthcare for drug discovery, automotive for self-driving technologies, and financial services for fraud detection. By tailoring its offerings to these verticals, NVIDIA can tap into new revenue streams and diversify its customer base.\n\nGenerative AI and Large Language Models: The rise of generative AI and large language models presents a significant opportunity for NVIDIA. The company's AI inference platforms and NVIDIA DGX Cloud services are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. By continuing to innovate and provide cutting-edge solutions for AI model development and training, NVIDIA can maintain its leadership and drive growth in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nThreats\n\nIntensifying Competition: The market for GPUs and AI computing is highly competitive, with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces competition from companies that provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, and other accelerated computing processor products. Some competitors may have greater marketing, financial, and manufacturing resources, which could challenge NVIDIA's market share. Staying ahead of the competition through continuous innovation and strategic partnerships is critical for NVIDIA's sustained success.\n\nRegulatory and Geopolitical Risks: NVIDIA's operations are subject to complex laws, rules, and regulations, which could adversely impact its business. Changes in export control rules, particularly with the strategic importance of AI, could limit NVIDIA's ability to sell its products in key markets like China and the Middle East. Additionally, geopolitical tensions could disrupt the supply chain and manufacturing operations. Proactively managing these risks and advocating for favorable regulatory environments are essential for NVIDIA's future growth.\n\nIn conclusion, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) exhibits formidable strengths with its market leadership in data centers and AI, as well as its robust financial performance. However, it must navigate weaknesses related to its supply chain concentration and dependence on third-party suppliers. Opportunities for expansion into new markets and capitalizing on generative AI are\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "(Updates prices as of 0345 GMT)\n\nBy Kevin Buckland\n\nTOKYO, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average topped its all-time peak on Thursday, after unexpectedly strong revenue forecasts from U.S. chip designer Nvidia lifted Asian tech stocks.\n\nHowever, the regional mood was tempered by the struggle in Chinese stock markets to extend multi-month highs reached amid Beijing's stimulus efforts.\n\nLong-term U.S. bond yields hugged three-month highs while the dollar sagged after minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting confirmed the view that interest rate cuts would be slow in coming, but weren't markedly more hawkish than the Fed's previously expressed views.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 share average surged as much as 2% to reach 39,029.00, topping the previous all-time high of 38,957.44, set on Dec. 29, 1989, at the peak of the so-called bubble economy.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.29%, helped by a 0.69% rise for Taiwan's stock benchmark.\n\nThe Hang Seng was 0.17%, recovering from earlier losses, to put the Hong Kong benchmark on course to extend a seven-day winning run.\n\nMainland blue chips were last up 0.29%, after oscillating throughout the session between small gains and losses.\n\nU.S. stock index futures signalled solid gains, following a mixed session on Wednesday for the main benchmarks. S&P 500 futures rallied 0.7% and tech-focused Nasdaq futures jumped 1.4%.\n\nFollowing the closing bell overnight, Nvidia forecast a roughly 233% surge in quarterly revenue, sending its shares up some 10% after-hours.\n\nThe Nikkei has jumped about 16.5% already this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rallying some 5% each, driven in large part by mammoth expectations for artificial intelligence (AI), with Nvidia's chips at the centre of that boom.\n\n\"Nvidia's earnings beat boosted sentiment and eased concerns over stretched valuations, providing room for the AI theme to continue to drive markets,\" Saxo Markets analysts wrote in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield eased slightly in Asian time on Thursday to 4.3009%, but remained close to the 4.332% level marked a week ago, which had not been seen since the end of November.\n\nThe bulk of policymakers at the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting in January were concerned about the risks of cutting interest rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level, minutes released on Wednesday showed.\n\nThat reinforced the view among traders that any rate cut is not imminent, with market pricing suggesting one-in-three odds for a first reduction in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe dollar continued to retreat from a three-month high reached last week, when the U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, reached 104.97. It was down slightly at 103.96 in early trading on Thursday.\n\nThe euro ticked slightly higher to $1.0823, whereas the yen edged down to 150.41 per dollar.\n\nElsewhere, oil prices rose slightly, adding to gains from the previous session that came amid signs of tighter supply.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) CLc1 rose 17 cents to $78.08 a barrel for the prompt month. The May contract gained 14 cents to $77.45 a barrel.\n\nBrent crude for April delivery ticked up 14 cents to $83.17 a barrel, while the May contract added 13 cents to $82.24 a barrel.\n\nOil prices rose 1% on Wednesday, with refinery restarts in the United States supporting demand after a series of outages earlier cut U.S. refinery utilisation rates to the lowest level in two years.\n\n(Reporting by Kevin Buckland; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Christopher Cushing)",

The weak yen is offering a further tailwind and boosting Japanese exporters, while the Tokyo bourse’s push to improve corporate governance is raising expectations for more shareholder returns.\n\n“After some recent consolidation, Nvidia’s earnings beat is just the perfect catalyst for Japanese equities to reach record highs,” said Charu Chanana, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “And structural tailwinds from geopolitics to corporate reform, as well as a weak yen, continue to suggest that Japanese equities is a story where macro meets momentum and a peak is still rather far.”\n\nTokyo Electron surged as much as 6.6%, while Screen jumped 10%. The tech sector led the advance after the world’s most valuable chipmaker Nvidia exceeded earnings estimates and surged in after-hours trading.\n\nThe yen remained weak, staying beyond the 150 per dollar level, after the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes that revealed caution about cutting interest rates and amid the Bank of Japan’s continued easy-money policy. Toyota Motor Corp. contributed the most to the Topix’s gain, increasing almost 3%, after Mizuho Securities Co. hiked its price target for the automaker.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the pace of the market’s rally catching some by surprise, strategists have raised their forecasts for the Nikkei. Nomura Holdings Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. lifted their year-end forecasts on Feb. 15. Citigroup increased its 2024 high for the index to 45,000 from 39,000, saying Japanese equities may reach targets sooner than expected.\n\nConfidence that the economy has shaken off inflation, leading to broad-based gains in asset prices, has also supported sentiment.\n\nOverseas investors from BlackRock Inc. to Robeco Institutional Asset Management and Warren Buffett have voiced bullishness toward Japanese stocks. Foreigners bought a net of ¥382 billion ($2.5 billion) of Japanese stocks for the week ended Feb. 16, according to the Ministry of Finance. It was the seventh straight week of net buying.\n\nAdding to bullish factors, earnings results for the third quarter have been positive at heavyweights such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Tokyo Electron. Shares of both companies are up more than 30% from the start of the year.\n\n--With assistance from Eddy Duan and Aya Wagatsuma.\n\n(Updates with market moves)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls Hybrid Plug-Ins Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "BTC Drops to Weekly Lows as Traders Focus on Nvidia Earnings\n\nBitcoin's recent bullish momentum took a hit on February 21, as the leading cryptocurrency struggled to break through resistance and even dipped towards its lows from the previous week. This pullback has analysts divided on the near-term outlook, with some urging caution and others highlighting potential catalysts for volatility in the coming days.\n\nOne key factor contributing to the uncertainty is the ongoing retesting of support levels. After reaching new 26-month highs of $53,000, Bitcoin encountered significant selling pressure. Even the anticipated boost from potential buyer interest in the newly launched spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to lift the market sentiment.\n\nHowever, not everyone is ready to call a bearish turn. Trader Daan Crypto Trades advised against overreacting to the current sentiment, suggesting that it might be premature to assume a definitive downward trend. He emphasized the need for confirmation before making directional bets.\n\nAnother potential source of volatility identified by QCP Capital is the upcoming earnings report from tech giant Nvidia. High funding rates in the Bitcoin market are currently contributing to the price weakness, and the firm believes that any disappointment in Nvidia's earnings could trigger a sell-off across risk assets, including Bitcoin. Daan Crypto Trades echoed this sentiment, predicting a potentially \"frothy\" week if Nvidia beats expectations and sends its stock price soaring.",

        "content": "Now that the FED is looking to lower interest rates this year, cheaper money and more accessible financing will let investors venture into riskier places in the economy and the stock market. While not that risky of an industry, the biotech space can often be speculative. This is because biotech stocks tend to move according to their trials and approvals for new technologies or drugs.\n\nToday, you are about to see how the markets have left enough evidence to figure out which of these will rise. It may be due to their managerial merit, or by the announcements that typically come to give the sector rallies. This is how the market speaks. If you are after outsized returns, it would be wise to get stuck in the following translations.\n\nBiotech Stocks That Could Be Multibaggers: Xenon Pharmaceuticals (XENE) Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA Stock\n\nSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeveloping novelty products with a vast pipeline of neurological therapies aiming to treat patients with neurological disorders (mainly in Canada for now), Xenon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: XENE) is calling the market’s attention in all of the right ways today. Even analysts seem to be on board with this one.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn their investor relations website, management has released a press release to let shareholders and markets know what could be coming later this year. In a key milestone opportunity outline, the company has rolled out the XEN1101 Phase 3 Program. This will treat major depressive disorders for their patients.\n\nOf course, this sort of thing is up to regulator approval to significantly impact the stock price as a result of higher earnings. So, amid uncertainty, there are two things that you can check today. First, you can rest assured of the 107.8% earnings per share growth analysts expect to see from this firm in the next 12 months.\n\nSecond, by looking over the forward price-to-earnings ratio, you can gauge how much markets are willing to pay today for tomorrow’s expected earnings. The saying “It must be expensive for a reason” applies here. So, don’t be afraid to overpay for a good thing when the rest of the market is doing so.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes 538.0 times forward P/E sound high to you? Investors probably thought that a 250.0 times P/E for NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock was high last year. The stock has broken many ceilings since then.\n\nArgenx (ARGX) Person holding cellphone with logo of Dutch biotechnology company Argenx SE (ARGX) on screen in front of business webpage Focus on phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs is true biotech fashion, this company had its management take a whole section of its website dedicated to the entire product pipeline that it holds, along with how far along each product is. Here is why Argenx (NASDAQ: ARGX) comes to shine.\n\nYou will notice right away that at least a dozen projects are about to break out of their proof of concept space, and be launched into registration. In dealing with autoimmune diseases in the United States and overseas, this company is highly exposed to major medical trends across different patient demographics.\n\nCurrently, in Phase One, the ARGX-118 project is one that could grab a lot of attention soon. It prevents airway inflammation. This theme has been a top concern for most patients since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMarkets are showing similar excitement about the potential future of this company. Markets have bid up the stock’s forward P/E up to 111.7 times on the back of analysts’ projections for roughly 240.0% EPS growth in the coming year. The valuation seems justified on the bet that the ARGX-118 could soon pass its Phase 1. This is easily one of the top biotech stocks on the market.\n\nIntraCellular Therapies (ITCI) Red blood cells.\n\nSource: Corona Borealis Studio / Shutterstock\n\nOn a similar theme, IntraCellular Therapies (NASDAQ: ITCI) deals with neurological disorders in the U.S. (to diversify from Xenon’s Canada presence), mainly in the bipolar depression and Parkinson’s disease treatment space.\n\nThis stock has the lowest forward P/E of the three; at 88.8 times, it is still at the top of the industry due to its potential to surprise investors with a new announcement. However, this company likes to drop the big bombs during quarterly earnings calls rather than at random timely intervals like its other two peers.\n\nNonetheless, there must be something big enough cooking behind the scenes at the company since analysts feel comfortable pushing for projected EPS growth of 225.8% for this year as well. The one thing that could trigger such explosive expansion is their current Lumateperone pipeline, which will imminently break out of Phase 3 trials. If you are looking for the top biotech stocks, start here.\n\nAs of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "XSD: This ETF Offers More Semiconductor Diversification Than Its Peers",
        "content": "The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) is an interesting, diversified way to gain exposure to the semiconductor space. This ETF gives investors a different type of exposure to the semiconductor sector when compared to peers like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH).\n\nI’m bullish on this $1.5 billion ETF, as it has beaten the market over the long term and has a strong and diversified portfolio of top-rated semiconductor stocks. But there are also some significant considerations investors should weigh before choosing XSD over other semiconductor ETFs, which we’ll discuss in-depth in this article.\n\nWhat Is the XSD ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to State Street Global Advisors, XSD seeks to give investors exposure to the semiconductor sector of the S&P Total Market Index (TMI) by investing in the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index.\n\nThe key difference between XSD and other popular semiconductor ETFs is that this is a “modified equal weighted index which provides the potential for unconcentrated industry exposure across large, mid and small cap stocks.” We’ll discuss what this looks like in practice further below.\n\nXSD’s Portfolio\n\nXSD holds 40 stocks, and because of its modified equal-weighted approach, its top 10 holdings comprise just 32.7% of assets. Below is an overview of XSD’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nThis approach starkly contrasts other prominent semiconductor ETFs like the SMH and SOXX. SMH holds just 25 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up nearly three-quarters of its assets. SOXX holds 30 stocks, and its top 10 holdings comprise 60.1% of assets.\n\nBecause of this, XSD is a more diversified way to invest across stocks of all market caps within the semiconductor space and doesn’t leave investors with as much exposure to just a handful of names. For example, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is SMH’s largest holding and accounts for a massive 24.8% of the fund’s assets. Nvidia is also XSD’s largest holding, but it accounts for a more manageable 3.9% of the fund.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, Nvidia is a great stock, and its surge over the past year has helped drive SMH’s stellar performance, but XSD gives investors a less concentrated portfolio where results won’t be as impacted by the performance of Nvidia and a handful of other names.\n\nOverall, XSD owns a strong group of stocks. Eight of its top 10 holdings receive Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from one to 10 based on eight market key factors. A Smart Score of 8 or higher is considered equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nNotably, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Allegro Microsystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) all boast ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores.\n\nXSD itself receives a Neutral-equivalent 7 out of 10 Smart Score.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of XSD’s Performance\n\nThere is a “glass-half-empty” and a “glass-half-full way” to view XSD’s performance, as we’ll discuss below.\n\nAs of January 31, XSD has returned 5.8% annually over the past three years, 24.5% annually over the past five years, and 22.0% annually over the past 10 years.\n\nWhile XSD’s three-year results are underwhelming, its five- and 10-year returns are outstanding. In fact, XSD has outperformed both the S&P 500 (SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NDX) over both of these time frames.\n\nAs of January 31, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 14.2% over the past five years and 12.6% over the past decade. Meanwhile, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has returned 20.7% over the past five years and 18.1% over the past 10 years.\n\nOn the other hand, while this has been a great performance, XSD has lagged behind its semiconductor peers like SOXX and SMH.\n\nSOXX has superior annualized returns of 16.0% over the past three years, 31.1% over the past five, and 24.5% over the past 10.\n\nMeanwhile, SMH also outperformed XSD with annualized returns of 18.8% over the past three years, 32.1% over the past five years, and 26.1% over the past decade.\n\nWhile XSD’s returns have beaten the broader market, it’s hard to get around the fact that it has trailed its peers like SMH and SOXX. The clear difference here is that because they are not equal-weighted, SMH and SOXX have benefited from their largest positions. Nvidia, in particular, has posted outsized gains over the past year plus.\n\nWith that said, it’s possible that if Nvidia reverts to the mean a bit or other stocks in the semiconductor pack catch up with Nvidia, XSD could outperform its rivals going forward based on this regression.\n\nHow Expensive Is XSD?\n\nXSD’s expense ratio of 0.35% means that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually. This is the same expense ratio that SMH and SOXX both charge, as these funds are all competitors.\n\nIs XSD Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, XSD earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 34 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average XSD stock price target of $259.71 implies 19.7% upside potential.\n\nNotably, according to their average price targets, analysts seem to be ascribing more upside to XSD than to SMH and SOXX. While XSD’s target implies 19.7% upside, the average SMH stock price target implies upside of 11.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, the average SOXX price target of $677.21 implies upside of 10.4%.\n\nThe higher potential upside for XSD (according to analysts) can be explained by the fact that XSD has more exposure to the semiconductor stocks that have underperformed the sector’s leaders, like Nvidia, but may have further upside ahead.\n\nTaking It All In\n\nOn the plus side, XSD has soundly beaten the market over the long term. It has a strong and diversified portfolio of highly-rated stocks in a secular growth industry, and it gives investors diverse exposure to many different semiconductor stocks.\n\nOn the negative side, while its equal-weighted approach is prudent and gives investors diversification, it clearly has hindered the ETF in recent years as the semiconductor sector’s biggest winners, like Nvidia, have driven superior gains for ETFs like SMH and SOXX, which have significantly higher exposure to the company.\n\nAt some point in the future, XSD’s equal-weighted approach may lead it to outperform SMH and SOXX if outsized winners like Nvidia revert to the pack and other semiconductor names outperform, but it’s unclear if or when that will happen.\n\nIn sum, I’m bullish on XSD and believe it will continue to be a strong performer over the long term. However, whether an investor prefers XSD over bigger recent winners like SMH and SOXX comes down to whether they want a more conservative, equal-weighted approach to the space (if, for example, they believe that shares of some of the industry’s biggest winners like Nvidia will come back down to earth) or an approach that gives more exposure to the top performers.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "$1.7 trillion chip giant Nvidia just gained over $100 billion in value after a blowout quarter, but this mega-bearish analyst says the tech industry is in an AI bubble",
        "content": "Investors have long had a love affair with U.S. tech stocks from the boom cycle of the late ‘90s and early 2000s that famously ended with the dotcom crash, to the AI-induced heights of Nvidia’s current stock rally. Love affairs, though, often end badly, and this one could leave investors nursing both an aching wallet and a broken heart. Artificial intelligence has officially thrust the U.S. tech industry into a bubble and Silicon Valley could be on the precipice of another crash, according to an analyst note from BCA Research chief strategist Dhaval Joshi.\n\n“We are in an AI bubble,” Joshi tells Fortune. “We've been wowed by some of the results.”\n\nFew stocks embodied that wow factor like the $1.7 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia, which reported earnings on Wednesday, blowing analyst expectations out of the water. The chipmaker—dubbed “the most important stock on planet earth,” by a Goldman Sachs analyst—reported revenues of $22.1 billion during the last quarter, compared to a forecast of $20.6 billion. Revenues for the company's data center chips, used in AI models and generative AI applications, reflected increased demand and reached $18.4 billion, up 27% from the third quarter and 409% compared to last year. Stock prices rose 7% in post-market trading, adding over $100 billion of value.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” said Nvidia founder and chief executive Jensen Huang in a press release. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”\n\nWhile Joshi didn’t comment on Nvidia specifically, its outstanding results can be seen as evidence for his case.\n\nThe tech sector is trading at a 75% premium to the global stock market, according to Joshi’s calculations in an analyst note published last week. Its scorching-hot growth became the backbone on which much of the rest of the U.S. stock market’s growth was built and drove the Nasdaq to near record highs last year, just 6.5% off its all-time high in November 2021. In 2023, the so-called Magnificent Seven, which comprise Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla, contributed two thirds of the S&P 500’s total market gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd while those gains are impressive and remunerative for savvy investors, they’re unsustainable, according to Joshi.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, some companies won’t be able to live up to the lofty expectations the market sets. That could spell trouble because valuations and stock prices are often measured against expectations as much as they are actual results. If the major tech companies that make up much of the sector’s (and the economy’s) growth miss out on analyst expectations they could drag others down with them. While he cautions against underestimating AI as a whole, Joshi believes the market is pricing in far too much productivity growth from the new technology. And when new innovations fail to live up to those expectations the market will punish the companies that made them.\n\n“Because these handful of stocks have become such a massive percentage of the market cap, any disappointment there is mathematically going to have an impact on the overall index,” Joshi says.\n\nIn order for the U.S. tech sector to avoid bubble territory, it would have to continue trading at a 10% premium to the market—a scenario which Joshi sees as unlikely.\n\nJoshi doesn't blame the market for valuing tech companies so highly. In fact, they’ve proven their worth over the last 10 years by achieving stellar results time and time again. In the last decade the stocks of premier tech firms have soared. For example, since February 2014 Nvidia’s stock has risen 14,927%, Microsoft’s 964%, and Apple’s 875%. The numbers pale in comparison to the still-robust 163% the S&P 500 returned over the last 10 years. Even though he doesn’t believe it will continue, he says it is rational for the market to keep pricing in more explosive growth in tech.\n\n“If you get very strong earnings growth, for one or two years, the market thinks of it the other way: ‘This can’t be sustained.’ So if anything, you give it a low valuation, because you say these are abnormally high earnings. But if the market sees 10 years of outstanding performance it no longer considers those results abnormal, coming to expect them in perpetuity, Joshi says.\n\nFor Joshi, though, the last 10 years of blockbuster earnings growth were, in fact, abnormal. In large part because the bulk of that growth was a result of the network effect, which allowed a select few firms to balloon in size and effectively gain control of a market. Amazon captured the market for online shopping, Google did the same for search, and Meta cornered the market in online communication, Joshi writes in his note.\n\n“Once you have networks, you have winners and losers,” he says. “Those winners become natural monopolies, and if you're a natural monopoly, then you're in a very strong position to grow your profits.”\n\nWithout a clear indication that the network effect will translate to the world of AI, those companies won’t have the same dominant position, Joshi argues. “The market is saying, ‘hey the baton is going to be passed on now to generative AI and that will continue the trend for the next five to 10 years.’ I'm very cynical about that because there is no network effect in generative AI.”\n\nThere is the possibility that some especially popular AI tools could see a network effect if they attract more users because they’ll be able to train themselves on all the tasks they get asked to perform.\n\nEven without AI it seems like the benefits of the network effect could be reduced in the near future because of a push from elected officials to regulate Big Tech. “The Web 2.0 revolution has reached its limit because of consumer backlash and much harder, tougher regulation about what data you can collect and how you can use it.”\n\nIn Europe, the EU already passed several landmark pieces of legislation meant to break up some of the power tech giants like Apple and Alphabet already had on the market. While in the U.S. despite there being no national privacy law there is an unprecedented level of bipartisan and public support for a series of new laws that would limit the amount and type of data that tech companies can collect on users.\n\nBut despite the hurdles Joshi sees on the horizon for tech, he doesn’t anticipate the whole sector will come crashing down as it did in the dotcom bust. In fact, it will continue to outpace the overall market just at a slower pace. That could still mean tough losses for investors, especially as the market eventually readjusts for a tech sector that no longer delivers hundredfold returns.\n\nTo be sure, whether or not the market is in the midst of an AI bubble is still hotly debated. Joshi isn’t alone in thinking there is one. Morgan Stanley cautioned against racing headfirst into AI, lest investors not have an adequate lay of the land before the bubble bursts. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs and others argue that soaring returns aren’t a bubble, just the market rewarding the future of technology.\n\nAs for what investors should do to mitigate the risks of a possible AI bubble, Joshi has some simple advice: invest in other parts of the market like healthcare and luxury goods.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Customer demand for Nvidia chips is so far above supply that CEO Jensen Huang had to discuss how ‘fairly’ the company decides who can buy them",
        "content": "With demand for his company's AI chips soaring and supply limited, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was forced to deliver an unusual message Wednesday.\n\n\"We allocate fairly. We do the best we can to allocate fairly, and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\" Huang said in response to a question during Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nThe Nvidia boss was referring to how the company decides who gets first dibs on its graphics processors, or GPUs, the hardware that powers the artificial intelligence boom. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet can't get enough of Nvidia's GPUs as they race to build datacenters that make popular generative AI services like ChatGPT, Runway AI and Gemini a reality.\n\nAnd that's just one group of customers. A long list of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) are also clamoring for the GPUs, not to mention customers in industries like biology, healthcare, finance, AI development, and robotics.\n\nHaving to choose between desperate customers might seem like a good problem to have. Indeed, Nvidia's $22 billion in fourth quarter revenue was more than triple what it was a year ago and came in $2 billion above the company's own forecast.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” Huang said in a statement accompanying the results, which sent Nvidia's stock up more than 8% in after hours trading.\n\nBut managing that demand is no simple feat, and in the chip business, getting it wrong can have disastrous consequences on the balance sheet. So Huang needs customers to trust that Nvidia isn't playing favorites, lest they order more than they actually need or consider alternatives such as AMD's forthcoming AI chips.\n\nIn trying to assure listeners of Nvidia's even-handedness, Huang explained how the company works strategically with cloud service providers—which account for 40% of Nvidia's datacenter business—to ensure that they can responsible plan for their needs.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our CSPs have a very clear view of our product roadmap and transitions,\" Huang said. \"And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place, and where, and when... they know the timing to the best of our ability, and they know quantities and of course allocation.\"\n\nAll eyes are on Nvidia\n\nThe attention that Nvidia's earnings report commanded on Wednesday cannot be overstated. Across social media platforms, vivid artificially-generated images depict cityscapes in disarray, with towering structures engulfed in flames, each captioned with various ways of saying—a failure by Nvidia to meet earnings expectations could have profound implications for the world at large.\n\n\"If Nvidia doesn’t beat earnings expectations today the earth will explode,\" one financial advisor joked in a tweet.\n\nIn the era of burgeoning artificial intelligence and heightened corporate demand for its capabilities, Nvidia has emerged as a pivotal player. Its significance is underscored by the fact that it commands over 80% of the worldwide market for the specialized chips essential for powering AI applications, according to Reuters. This week, Nvidia's market cap surged to $1.8 trillion, propelling it to the position of the fourth-largest company globally by market capitalization, surpassing both Amazon and Alphabet in the process.\n\nWhen it comes to GPU supply, Huang said the issue is more complex than it might seem. While he commended the supply chain for providing Nvidia with necessary components like packaging, memory, and various other parts, he underscored the substantial size of the GPUs themselves.\n\n\"People think that Nvidia GPUs is like a chip. But the Nvidia Hopper GPU is 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds,\" Huang said. \"These things are really complicated...people call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever looking look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind boggling. It is the most dense, complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "CEOs of OpenAI and Intel cite artificial intelligence's voracious appetite for processing power",
        "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Two tech CEOs scrambling to produce more of the sophisticated chips needed for artificial intelligence met for a brainstorming session Wednesday while the booming market’s early leader reported another quarter of eye-popping growth.\n\nThe on-stage conversation between Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman unfolded in a San Jose, California, convention center a few hours after Nvidia disclosed its revenue for the November-January period nearly quadrupled from the previous year.\n\nIntel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that has been struggling in recent years, laid out its plans for catching up to Nvidia during a daylong conference. Gelsinger kicked things off with a opening speech outlining how he envisions the feverish demand for AI-equipped chips revitalizing his company in a surge he dubbed the “Siliconomy.”\n\n“It’s just magic the way these tiny chips are enabling the modern economic cycle we are in today,” Gelsinger said.\n\nOpenAI, a San Francisco startup backed by Microsoft, has become one of technology’s brightest stars since unleashing its most popular AI innovation, ChatGPT, in late 2022. Altman is now eager to push the envelope even further while competing against Google and other companies such as Anthropic and Inflection AI. But the next leaps he wants to make will take far more processing power than what's currently available.\n\nThe imbalance between supply and the voracious appetite for AI chips explains why Altman is keenly interested in securing more money to help expand the industry's manufacturing capacity. During his talk with Gelsinger, he dodged a question about whether he is trying to raise as much as $7 trillion — more the combined market value of Microsoft and Apple — as was recently reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n“The kernel of truth is we think the world is going to need a lot more (chips for) AI compute,” Altman said. “That is going to require a global investment in a lot of stuff beyond what we are thinking of. We are not in a place where we have numbers yet.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAltman emphasized the importance of accelerating the AI momentum of the past year to advance a technology that he maintains will lead to a better future for humanity, although he acknowledged there will be downsides along the way.\n\n\"We are heading to a world where more content is going to be generated by AI than content generated by humans,\" Altman said. “This is not going to be only a good story, but it’s going to be a net good story.”\n\nPerhaps no company is benefiting more from the AI gold rush now than Nvidia. The 31-year-old chipmaker has catapulted to the technological forefront because of its head start in making the graphics processing units, or GPUs, required to fuel popular AI products such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nOver the past year, Nvidia has been a stunning streak of growth that has created more than $1.3 trillion in shareholder wealth in less than 14 months. That has turned it into the fifth most valuable U.S. publicly traded company behind only Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google’s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.\n\nIntel, in contrast, has been trying to convince investors that Gelsinger has the Santa Clara, California, company on a comeback trail three years after he was hired as CEO.\n\nSince his arrival, Gelsinger already has pushed the company into the business of making chips for other firms and has committed $20 billion to building new factories in Ohio as part of its expansion into running so-called “foundries” for third parties.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s conference, Gelsinger predicted that by 2030 Intel would be overseeing the world’s second largest foundry business, presumably behind the current leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TMSC, largely by meeting the demand for AI chips.\n\n“There's sort of a space race going on,\" Gelsinger told reporters Wednesday after delivering the conference's keynote speech. “The overall demand (for AI chips) appears to be insatiable for several years into the future.”\n\nGelsinger’s turnaround efforts haven’t impressed investors so far. Intel’s stock price has fallen by 30% under his reign while Nvidia’s shares have increased by roughly fivefold during the same span.\n\nIntel also is angling for a chunk of the $52 billion that the U.S. Commerce Department plans to spread around in an effort to increase the country’s manufacturing capacity in the $527 billion market for processors, based on last year’s worldwide sales.\n\nLess than $2 billion of the funds available under the 2022 CHIPs and Science Act has been awarded so far, but Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, in a video appearance at Wednesday’s conference, promised “a steady drumbeat” of announcements about more money being distributed.\n\nRaimondo also told Gelsinger that she emerged from recent discussions with Altman and other executives leading the AI movement having a difficult time processing how big the market could become.\n\n\"The volume of chips they say they need is mind-boggling,” she said.",

South Korean shares also rose, while Australian shares erased early losses. US futures climbed, reversing a small decline for the Nasdaq 100 and bolstering a small gain for the S&P 500.\n\nMoves in US futures were spurred on by Nvidia results. The tech company’s shares soared as much as 11% in post-market trade after it said first-quarter revenue would likely hit $24 billion, above prior estimates of around $22 billion.\n\nInvestors in Asia will be keeping a close eye on chip and AI-related stocks as the earnings were predicted to be a catalyst for market sentiment. The bullish Nvidia results helped support shares in the chip giant’s Asia-based suppliers as South Korea listed SK Hynix Inc and Japan’s Advantest Corp both rose around 3% in early Thursday trade.\n\n“As goes Nvidia, so goes the market,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “And it looks like the results are good enough. It does confirm the narrative that AI is going to continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. This narrative supported the markets last year, why wouldn’t it do the same this year?”\n\nCurrency markets were mostly stable early Thursday with the yen largely trading at just over 150 per dollar.\n\nTreasuries steadied in Asia after selling off Wednesday pushing the 10-year yield five basis points higher. The selling pressure was felt across the curve, and followed a $16 billion sale of 20-year bonds and the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes that revealed caution about cutting rates. Australian and New Zealand bonds tracked the declines.\n\nStory continues\n\nRichmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin highlighted persistent pricing pressures in sectors such as housing even though headline inflation is falling. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, meanwhile, pushed back against the prospect of imminent cuts.\n\nInvestors will be again focused on China, after further official efforts to support its financial markets. The country has banned major institutional investors from reducing equity holdings at the open and close of each trading day, an order from the securities watchdog to major asset managers and brokerages stated, according to people familiar with the matter. The regulator has also stepped up the monitoring of short selling.\n\nThe Golden Dragon index of US-listed Chinese shares rose almost 1% Wednesday in New York, following gains for mainland and Hong Kong shares.\n\nElsewhere, Qantas Airways Ltd shares rallied. The carrier said first-half profit declined as airfares fell from their post-Covid spike as it delivered a A$1.25 billion underlying first-half, pre-tax profit, down from a year earlier, but less than analysts expected. United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s fourth-quarter profit expanded, powered by stronger fee income from wealth and credit cards.\n\nA busy day for economic reports in Asia includes Hong Kong inflation, China Swift yuan payments, Indonesia’s fourth-quarter current account balance, and a monetary policy decision in South Korea.\n\nLater Thursday data set for release includes Eurozone inflation and PMIs, as well as US initial jobless claims and home sales.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate rose to extend a 1.1% Wednesday gain, supported by tightening physical supplies. Gold was steady at around $2,025 per ounce. Bitcoin was little changed after a decline on Wednesday to trade around $51,350.\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\nEurozone S&P Global Services PMI, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, CPI, Thursday US initial jobless claims, US existing home sales, Thursday ECB issues account of January meeting, Thursday Fed Governor Lisa Cook and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak, Thursday China property prices, Friday Germany IFO business climate, GDP, Friday ECB publishes 1- and 3-Year inflation expectations survey, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures rose 0.6% as of 9:32 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.3% Nikkei 225 futures (OSE) rose 1% Japan’s Topix rose 0.7% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.2% Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.5%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0827 The Japanese yen was little changed at 150.41 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.1987 per dollar The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6556\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin rose 0.5% to $51,620.63 Ether rose 0.8% to $2,950.11\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.32% Japan’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.725% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 4.21%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.3% to $78.14 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Equity investors can exhale.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Surges After AI Boom Shows No Signs of Letting Up Tech Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Outlook: Markets Wrap Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024 China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close\n\nOn a day when virtually all trading felt like a prelude to Nvidia Corp.’s earnings report, the AI chip-making darling delivered a robust sales forecast that reinvigorated the artificial-intelligence mania behind last year’s stock-market rally. Its shares surged, spurring gains in index futures and rallies in global peers and suppliers.\n\nThe company gave revenue guidance for the current period that beat Wall Street’s lofty expectations, signaling demand remains solid for the hardware behind what purports to herald a revolution in productivity — and profitability.\n\nNvidia, the fourth-biggest component of the Nasdaq 100, with a 5% weighting, rallied 8% in post-market New York trading. Nvidia competitors Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. rose as well. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed more than 1%.\n\nSK Hynix Inc., a key supplier of memory chips to Nvidia, jumped as much as 4.7% in early trading in Seoul on Thursday. Japanese chip-tester maker Advantest Corp. surged 6.3%.\n\nWall Street’s reaction to Nvidia’s earnings:\n\nKim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC:\n\nNvidia has been the driver of the market for the past 11 months, as goes Nvidia, so goes the market. And it looks like the results are good enough - not a huge positive or a negative surprise. It does confirm the narrative that AI is going to continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. This narrative supported the markets last year, why wouldn’t it do the same this year?\n\nThomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments:\n\nWith a revenue beat like this and guidance being raised for the current quarter, Nvidia is still growing and remains the AI leader. Do you really want to sell that? Everyone — including myself — was holding their breath wondering what could happen with this report. But Nvidia has clearly been experiencing such strong demand for its products and growth. To the extent that Nvidia can continue to deliver, that holds the line for the company and its stock price needs to be reflective of this new information.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments:\n\nIt’s another blowout quarter. This is very bullish for stock investors and Nvidia has shown us that AI is here to stay. More importantly, the company has also show us that the AI excitement can be translated into actual earnings. That’s very powerful and they continue to beat Wall Street forecasts.\n\nThomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com:\n\nThe market was poised to sell the news following Nvidia’s earnings, given the sky-high expectations and deteriorating macro conditions. However, once again, the company left no doubt that the AI boom is much more than just a stock market narrative, but rather, the most significant bet from corporations worldwide at this moment.\n\n(Updates with Nasdaq 100 futures and Asian share reactions; adds more analyst comments)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. surged in late trading after delivering another eye-popping sales forecast, adding fresh momentum to a stock rally that already made it the world’s most valuable chipmaker.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Surges After AI Boom Shows No Signs of Letting Up Tech Up in Late Hours on Nvidia’s Bullish Outlook: Markets Wrap Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Biden Touts $1.2 Billion in Student Loan Relief With Eye to 2024 China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close\n\nRevenue in the current period will be about $24 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted $21.9 billion on average. Results in the fourth quarter also sailed past Wall Street estimates.\n\nThe outlook extends a streak of Nvidia shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its artificial intelligence accelerators — highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on simple prompts.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in the statement. “Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.”\n\nThe shares jumped as much as 11% in extended trading following the announcement. They earlier closed at $674.72 in New York, leaving them up 36% for the year.\n\nNvidia’s market capitalization increased by more than $400 billion this year — bringing its valuation to $1.7 trillion — as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\n\nThat turned Wednesday’s report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the numbers — along with the upbeat tone from Huang — renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\n\nShares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. — three other chipmakers expected to benefit from AI growth — also gained in late trading.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,” Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note. Guidance was strong enough to “demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside through the second half.”\n\nNew Cycle\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Huang said that demand for Nvidia’s newest products will continue to outstrip supply for the rest of the year. Though supply is growing, demand isn’t showing any signs of slowing, he said.\n\n“Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle,” Huang said. That will lead to a doubling of the world’s data center installed base over the next five years and “represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions,” he said.\n\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company’s H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as many as possible.\n\nCompanies such as Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are Nvidia’s largest customers, accounting for nearly 40% of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\n\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan 28, Nvidia’s revenue more than tripled to $22.1 billion. Profit excluding certain items was $5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $20.4 billion and earnings of $4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn’t generate that much revenue in an entire year.\n\nNvidia’s data center division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $18.4 billion of revenue, up 409% from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $2.87 billion of sales.\n\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-center companies. Huang, 61, has traveled the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems — both to protect their data and gain a competitive advantage.\n\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems Inc. earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of that deal, Cisco, the world’s biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\n\nRead More: Nvidia, Cisco to Help Companies Build In-House AI Computing\n\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI chips.\n\nAMD recently began selling a line of accelerators called the MI300. It expects to get revenue of $3.5 billion from that product this year, up from an earlier projection of $2 billion. Nvidia isn’t standing still, though. Analysts expect the company to soon unveil more powerful accelerators.\n\nNvidia also has had to navigate new export rules for chips headed to China, the largest market for semiconductors. The company has scaled down the capabilities of its products in order to continue to sell to that region, which in the past has accounted for a quarter of revenue. Three months ago, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that the company’s projections would have been higher if it weren’t for the China rules.\n\nIn terms of data center revenue, China accounted for a mid-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. “We expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter,” Kress said Wednesday.\n\nThe company has begun sending samples of new chips that are compliant with restrictions to Chinese customers, Huang said. That should help business pick up again.\n\n“We’re going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,” Huang said.\n\n(Updates with comments from CEO starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Investor-favorite NVIDIA NVDA has just unveiled Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results, undoubtedly representing the most highly-awaited release of the current earnings cycle.\n\nThe release has wrapped up the Q4 reporting cycle for the ‘Mag 7’, whose performance as a group has been remarkable amid the AI frenzy.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at what the titan delivered.\n\nNVIDIA Q4\n\nThe company delivered Q4 revenue of a record $22.1 billion, up 27% sequentially and a sizable 409% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP EPS totaled $5.16, climbing 28% sequentially and 485% from the year-ago period.\n\nBoth items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, penciling in beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nData Center\n\nOf course, Data Center was the real highlight of the release, which included sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in $18.4 billion (yet again, another quarterly record) throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nJensen Huang, CEO, on the results: “Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,”.\n\nGaming\n\nGaming revenue growth was also robust, with quarterly revenue of $2.9 billion 56% higher year-over-year. It’s also worth noting that the company launched its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs throughout the period, with generative AI capabilities for over 100 million RTX AI PCs also announced.\n\nNVIDIA FY24\n\nConcerning FY24, record full-year revenue of $60.9 billion climbed 126% year-over-year, whereas non-GAAP EPS of $12.96 showed nearly 290% growth from FY23. Needless to say, the company enjoyed a fantastic FY24, and the share performance has reflected that vividly, up 250% over the last year.\n\nFY24 Data Center sales surged 217% to a record $47.5 billion, whereas full-year Gaming revenue climbed 15% to $10.4 billion.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnother robust quarter from NVIDIA NVDA has hit the tape, with scorching-hot Data Center demand and an improving gaming industry providing meaningful tailwinds. The company provided guidance for its 2025 Q1, expecting revenue of roughly $24.0 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Nvidia added over $129 billion in stock market value late on Wednesday after the chipmaker's hotly anticipated quarterly report beat estimates and sparked gains in other AI hardware stocks.\n\nNvidia's stock jumped almost 8% after its quarterly outlook exceeded analysts' estimates, along with its January-quarter revenue and profits.\n\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services. This made the Santa Clara, California company's outlook a major test of whether Wall Street's AI-fueled rally is likely to continue or potentially reverse.\n\nFollowing Nvidia's report, server component supplier Super Micro Computer jumped almost 6%, while Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices rose 3%.\n\nBroadcom and Marvell Technology, two more chipmakers benefiting from the surge in AI computing, rose over 2% each in extended trade.\n\nArm Holding added nearly 6%, now up more than 160% from the $51 price set in its initial public offering in September.\n\nNvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. That was well above the $22.17 billion predicted by analysts, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.16 vs $4.64 expected by analysts. Net income surged 769% from a year ago to $12.285 billion.\n\nWorries that Nvidia's quarterly report might not meet Wall Street's high expectations in recent days knocked its stock down almost 9% from record highs. Its late-day surge to $724 on Wednesday still leaves its short of its $739 record high close on Feb. 14.\n\nIncluding Wednesday's after-hours gain, Nvidia's stock has climbed over 40% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. In recent sessions, Nvidia has jockeyed with Amazon.com and Alphabet for a spot as Wall Street's third-most valuable company.\n\nNvidia has also recently replaced Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock by value.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

        "title": "NVIDIA Beats &amp; Raises in Q4; Late Trading +8%",
        "content": "Wednesday, February 21st, 2024\r\n\r\nIt’s tough to recall a more highly awaited single-quarter for a single company than NVIDIA’s NVDA fiscal Q4 results after today’s close. The leader of the A.I.-based tech stocks that became known as the Magnificent 7 roughly a year ago has only gotten stronger in 2024 than last year — at least until the last couple trading days. A slight level of trepidation began to creep in; would this great graphics chips company be able to continue to bring awe to Wall Street?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind we happen to be at a time in the U.S. economy of continued uncertainty, as fleshed out in the Fed minutes from the latest FOMC meeting on January 30-31 (more on this later). NVIDIA shares had grown nearly +250% over the past year, and only started selling off somewhat as this earnings report grew nearer. To further complicate things, the “whisper number” on the Street was undoubtedly higher than consensus expectations — meaning even a solid beat may not be enough to quench stock buyers’ thirst upon the Q4 release.\r\n\r\nTypically, NVIDIA beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Earnings of $5.16 per share — representing an eye-popping +769% year-over-year growth — on $22.1 billion in quarterly sales easily surpassed the $4.55 per share and $20.31 billion in the Zacks consensus, respectively. Its all-important Data Center segment grew +38% year over year to $18.4 billion, nearly a billion and a half dollars more than analysts were expecting. And this was without full participation of its China business, which continued to be hampered by U.S. licensing restrictions. Its Auto segment also beat estimates to $281 million in the quarter.\r\n\r\nFiscal Q1 revenue guidance was also impressive: $24 billion compared to the $21.5 billion analysts had been looking for. We don’t know exactly what the “whisper numbers” were for NVIDIA in the quarter, but apparently they had not been met: immediately upon the report’s release, shares fell another -3% on the news, after shedding nearly -8% from all-times highs registered a week ago. Yet in just the past few minutes, NVIDIA’s fortunes have changed — shares are now +8% in today’s after-market, and are up for related companies like Super Micro Computer SMCI and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, as well.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, upstart EV maker Rivian RIVN posted slight beats on both top and bottom lines compared with Zacks consenses, but forecast a lower total number of vehicles expected to be made in 2024: 57K, roughly the same as the company produced in 2023, below the 66K analysts following the company were expecting. Shares are now down -13.7% in late trading, adding to the already precipitous -27% drop year to date.\r\n\r\nEtsy ETSY shares are also down, nearly -3% at this hour, as the specialty e-commerce platform posted a big miss on Q4 earnings — 62 cents per share versus 78 cents expected — while outperforming on the top line, with revenues of $842 million from $827.4 million in the Zacks consensus. Etsy also guided to a top-line next quarter anticipated to be the low point of 2024, with a pickup expected later in the year.\r\n\r\nFinally, minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) were released at 2pm ET today, depicting a monetary body ahead of the market when it came to apprehension about the risks of a heating-up economy. The minutes showed the Fed already ruminating upside inflation possibilities at its two-day meeting at the end of last month, and as a group appeared in no hurry to begin cutting interest rates. Certainly not at its March 19-20 meeting; the next FOMC deliberation doesn’t happen until April 30-May 1st. By then we should have a clearer look at how the economy is clicking along, or whether it may then be in need of a rate cut.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "Artificial intelligence powerhouse Nvidia announced its highly-anticipated fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, which showed a massive jump in quarterly revenue from a year ago, reassuring investors that its AI edge is alive and well.\n\nNvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 28, was up 265% from a year ago and 22% from the prior quarter and totaled $22.1 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $20.6 billion. For fiscal year 2024, Nvidia's revenue rose 126% to $60.9 billion.\n\n\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,\" said Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Huang pointed to Nvidia's clout in data centers that power generative AI tools and in designing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) as an ongoing source of strength.\n\n\"Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers — demand for data processing, training and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies,\" Huang said. \"Vertical industries — led by auto, financial services and health care — are now at a multibillion-dollar level.\"\n\nNVIDIA: IS THE STOCK PRICED TO PERFECTION? Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street's expectations, thanks to the generative AI boom.\n\nNvidia's quarterly net income increased 33% from the prior quarter and 769% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2024, its net income was up 581% from the prior year with diluted earnings per share up 586%.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nHuang hinted that the company will have more news to share on its RTX graphics processing units (GPUs) in the near future.\n\n\"Nvidia RTX, introduced less than six years ago, is now a massive PC platform for generative AI, enjoyed by 100 million gamers and creators. The year ahead will bring major new product cycles with exceptional innovations to help propel our industry forward,\" Huang explained. \"Come join us at next month's GTC [GPU Technology Conference], where we and our rich ecosystem will reveal the exciting future ahead.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Nvidia CEO and founder Jensen Huang said that the company's data center business is diversifying its customer base.\n\nNvidia's stock has been on a turbulent ride in the build-up to this earnings report as investors wondered whether its latest results would be enough to maintain the massive growth the company has enjoyed over the last year.\n\nIts stock dropped by over 4.3% during Tuesday's trading session, and the dip continued in after-hours trading with a further decline of more than 1.9% to $680.90 a share — a level Nvidia last traded at in early February and about 7.9% below its all-time closing high of $739 a share just a week ago on Feb. 14.\n\nNvidia stock fell about 2.85% to $674.72 a share during Wednesday's trading session — bringing its gains in the last year to over 225%.\n\nAfter the release of its latest earnings report, Nvidia shares surged by over 7.8% to roughly $727.63 a share during after-hours trading, bringing the stock closer to the all-time highs it reached earlier this month.\n\nThis is a developing story.

        "title": "How Nvidia's Q4 earnings set the stage for further dominance",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose after market close on Wednesday after the company posted its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $22.10 billion in revenue versus an expected $20.62 billion. The company also posted adjusted earnings per share of $5.16 versus an expected $4.64 per share.\n\nAntoine Chkaiban, New Street Research Technology Infrastructure Analyst, and Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the results.\n\nChkaiban elaborates on the possibilities for Nvidia in the future, along with AI chip making as a whole: \"Global spending on data center AI chips tripled in 2023 from $15 billion to $45 billion and is now set to double again to $90 billion in 2024. And if we look out a few years, well late last year, Lisa Su CEO of AMD (AMD) pitched a target addressable market for data center AI chips of $400 billion in 2027. So now we just need to think about the future along two axis. Either it materializes in a healthy and sustainable way or we fall short of this prediction, with disappointments, over investments, and lower returns.\"\n\nSpeaking to Nvidia's dominance in the space, against their competition, Morgan says: \"I think we have to think of Nvidia as first to market in AI. They have been talking on their conference calls and their product calls for over five years about the fact that they are dominant in the space. And then it came to fruition about a year ago, on this quarter, when they had the big blowout quarter.\" He continues by mentioning one the reasons why Nvidia is ahead of competition: \"The average AI chip that Nvidia sells, we don't know the exact price, some of them are like $20,000 or $30,000 apiece. So you kind of wonder if like an AMD who's kind of known as being a lower-priced chipmaker, especially in the CPU area against Intel (INTC), or let's say the data service space, would they come to try to introduce a cheaper chip that maybe people would be willing to go with.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) came out with quarterly earnings of $5.16 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 13.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of $3.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.02, delivering a surprise of 19.64%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nNvidia , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter ended January 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.82%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nNvidia shares have added about 40.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Nvidia?\n\nWhile Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $4.78 on $21.48 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $20.43 on $92.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductor - General is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, ON24 (ONTF), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 22.\n\nThis webcasting and video communications services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +150%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nON24's revenues are expected to be $37.29 million, down 19.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A number of companies released their quarterly reports after the market close on Wednesday.\n\nLucid (LCID) posted a loss of $0.29 per share in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $157.2 million, which was less than the $178.4 million Wall Street was expecting. In 2024, the company says it expects to make 9,000 vehicles\n\nAPA Corporation (APA), the parent of Apache, reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, short of the Street's $1.33 estimate. Meanwhile, Marathon Oil (MRO) reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.69 in the fourth quarter, topped estimates of $0.65.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, sending stocks like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and C3.ai (AI) higher.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, Ines Ferré, Josh Schafer take a closer look at some of the stocks on the move in after-hours trading.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Nvidia, of course, was the headliner for earnings after the close. We did hear from other companies, too. Here with the latest results, we've got team coverage from Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, Ines Ferre, and Josh Schafer. Pras, let's start with you.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Thanks, Julie. I'm watching shares of Lucid Group here, lower in after-hours trading. The EV maker missed revenue expectations by more than $20 million in the fourth quarter. On the bottom line, the company reported an adjusted loss of $0.29 per share. For the full year 2024, Lucid setting a production target of 9,000 vehicles. That goal is slightly higher than the 8,400 produced last year.\n\nLucid had a tough start to 2024. Shares hit an all time low last month as weakening demand for EVs pushed bigger names like Tesla to slash prices. Now over to Ines Ferre for the latest in the energy space.\n\nStory continues\n\nINES FERRE: Yeah. That's right, Pras. And taking a look at Apache, that stock is down more than 2% after a missed for adjusted earnings for the company's fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings coming in at $1.15 per share. The Street was looking for $1.33. The company highlighting increased total company oil production by 8% year-over-year. Also, highlighting strong Permian Basin execution and well performance for its 2024 outlook. It's looking at oil growth of approximately 8% year-over-year.\n\nMoving on to Marathon Oil. Its fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share beat estimates with those coming in at $0.69 per share. The Street was looking for $0.65 a share. Revenue came in line with what Wall Street was expecting with a $1.69 billion. Net sales volume up 20% for the quarter year-over-year, and oil production up 14% year-over-year. We've seen a lot of that with oil companies last year.\n\nAnd now turning it over to Josh Schafer with a look at the after-hours reaction to Nvidia's latest quarterly results. Josh.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Ines. I've been looking at how the markets are reacting to Nvidia's earnings, given the company's meteoric rise and its role in the AI-infused stock rally. Many were sort of nervous coming to this report and wondering how the broader markets would react. We're probably going to have to wait until tomorrow to get a full sense of that.\n\nBut I do have some of the after-hours action with us right now. And we're looking at semiconductors chip stocks here. You can see Nvidia's up about 7% right now, been rising a little bit through the afternoon here. But interesting to see some of the other companies that have sort of traded with Nvidia on this AI rally. Taking AMD up about 4%. And then when you take a look at some of the other stocks here, Arm, we know recently caught a bid, including an investment from Nvidia that caught investor attention. That stock is up about 5% after hours right now.\n\nAnd this is, again, our semiconductor board. And I want to just take a look at the AI board. That board is a little bit different. It includes some stocks that don't necessarily make chips but are sort of included in that AI trade. And you can see within that, when you take a look at the AI trade overall, you're seeing some pretty significant moves right now.\n\nSupermicro Computers, which has been on a pretty crazy rally, if I reach over here and take a look at that, you can see that stock had been rallying significantly over the last month, kind of came down as people got worried about Nvidia's earnings, what were people going to say about AI, what was Nvidia going to tell us. We'll take a look at that, it's rallying 8% after hours.\n\nA company like C3 AI has been a popular play, just look at its ticker. That stock up 3% after hours. Also looking at SoundHound. This company also recently was announced that Nvidia had been investing in it. The stock popped on that news then had traded back down, up about 5% after hours right now. So guys, we're seeing some movement across the market in the green off these Nvidia earnings.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Exciting stuff. Thanks so much, Josh. And big thanks to Pras, Ines, and Josh for all of that coverage.",

        "content": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nEquity markets across Asia are likely to rise on Thursday, assuming the initial gains in Nvidia shares in after-hours U.S. trading on Wednesday following the company's fourth-quarter earnings are sustained.\n\nThe U.S. chip-making and artificial intelligence giant won't be the only influence - traders in Asia have on their plate PMI reports from Japan, Australia and India; inflation data from Hong Kong; and South Korea's latest interest rate decision and guidance.\n\nThey will also have the chance to digest the U.S. Fed's January meeting minutes that showed policymakers were concerned about the risks of cutting interest rates too soon, and a spike in U.S. bond yields following an extremely weak 20-year auction.\n\nBut for stocks, at the open at least, it will be all about Nvidia. Fourth-quarter revenue beat forecasts and the first-quarter outlook also exceeded analysts' expectations. Its shares rose 7% after the bell on Wednesday, but trading was extremely volatile.\n\nThe recovery in Chinese stocks from recent five-year lows, meanwhile, continues. The Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 index of blue chip shares both gained around 1% and chalked up their longest winning streaks in over a year.\n\nAnother up day on Thursday will seal their best runs since July 2020. The CSI 300 is now in the green for the year and the Shanghai Composite is creeping into positive territory.\n\nWhile investors have responded favorably to Beijing's efforts to prop up the market, inject liquidity into the banking system and boost economic activity, how long that positivity lasts is an open question.\n\nThe latest market measure, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, is a ban on major institutional investors reducing equity holdings at the open and close of each trading day.\n\nJapan's Nikkei, meanwhile, continues to pause for breath at its recent lofty 34-year heights just below 39,000 points, as dollar/yen consolidates around the 150.00 level.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan's purchasing managers index reports on Thursday could reveal whether the economy is any closer to exiting recession. Manufacturing activity has contracted every month except one since October 2022.\n\nJapan's government on Wednesday downgraded its view on the economy for the first time in three months on sluggish consumer spending, suggesting a bumpy path out of a recession in the face of slow wage recovery and lackluster industrial output.\n\nThe Bank of Korea will keep its key policy rate on hold at 2.50% for a ninth consecutive meeting, according to all economists polled by Reuters, who stuck to their long-held view the first rate cut will be in the third quarter.\n\nMoney markets indicate one 25-basis point rate cut will be delivered by August, and another by the end of the year.\n\nThe won has weakened 3% against the U.S. dollar so far this year, but has strengthened 3% against Japan's yen.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n\n- Australia, India, Japan PMIs (February)\n\n- South Korea interest rate decision\n\n- Hong Kong inflation (January)\n\n(By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)",

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Maker Robotics Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "There are some key robotics stocks for investors to buy in February. This is amid the broader indices such as the Nasdaq making a brief pullback. Some analysts expect that the rally for tech stocks in general will continue, as the decline was primarily chalked up to a decline in the stock prices of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and some otters in the Majestic Seven.\n\nThe robotics stocks in this article are powerful names, and I believe that they will continue to deliver strong gains to investors. Those who buy in early will reap the rewards. Investing a substantial amount in these companies could lead to seven-figure returns later on, and the growth potential of these companies is enormous.\n\nSo, here are some of the best companies for investors to scoop up this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is one of my favorite robotics stocks for investors wanting to dip their toes into the robotics healthcare market.\n\nISRG stock posted some strong results last quarter, and I believe that the best is yet to come for the company. For the fourth quarter of 2023, ISRG reported a 6% increase in systems revenue to approximately $480 million compared to the same quarter in 2022. Full-year 2023 systems revenue was approximately $1.68 billion, consistent with 2022. The company also increased the number of da Vinci surgical systems placed in 2023 to 1,370, up from 1,264 in 2022.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, ISRG anticipates a 13% to 16% increase in worldwide da Vinci procedures. The consensus among analysts is a “moderate buy,” with 16 buy ratings and 4 hold ratings.\n\nISRG looks set to continue it dominance in the robotic surgery industry, and this year and the next may continue that strength moving forward.\n\nSarcos Technology and Robotics (STRC) Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker cryptos. Strong Buy Stocks. Millionaire-maker quantum computing stocks\n\nSource: Epic Cure / Shutterstock\n\nSarcos Technology and Robotics (NASDAQ:STRC) is a company focused on the development of robotics and microelectromechanical systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, the company anticipates ending the year with around $39 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. STRC also expects net cash usage to average about $1.6 million per month in 2024, potentially decreasing further with additional revenue from customer purchases.\n\nThis comes after securing a notable $13.8 million, four-year development contract with the U.S. Air Force to advance AI and ML software.\n\nAlthough STRC is pre-earnings and only recorded $11.52 million in revenues, Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jeffries,updated his price target for the company to $1.15 in August last year, down from $4.25. However, this downgrade still implies a 109.85% upside for the company, which is expected to be reached within twelve months.\n\nThese early-stage companies like STRC may offer the biggest upsides for investors as they are the most risky, all else being equal. But sometimes, owning a few or even fractional shares in these moonshoots can potentially lead to seven-figure returns.\n\nSmith & Nephew (SNN) A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between them. Robotics stocks to buy\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock\n\nAlthough better known for its contributions to orthopedic reconstruction and advanced wound management, Smith & Nephew (NYSE:SNN) also ventures into robotics with its Navio surgical system. The Navio system is designed for both partial and total knee replacement procedures.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, the company saw revenue rise to $2,734 million, marking a 7.3% increase on an underlying basis. The increase was supported by strong performance in Sports Medicine & ENT and Advanced Wound Management.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects to generate more than $200 million in annual savings by 2025 as part of its broader strategy to enhance productivity and drive growth across its segments​.\n\nThe robotic surgery market is still in its infancy and is decentralized, with different robots specializing and being authorized for use in different surgeries. The growth potential of robotics can then be expected to be unlocked incrementally, and SNN is positioned well for its niche use case. This then makes it one of those robotics stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\r\nTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing.

The chip designer's shares fell, adding to the previous day's decline of more than 4%.\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to more than triple from the previous quarter's level on robust demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia shares have soared nearly 40% this year, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after a leap of almost 240% in 2023. Analysts have cautioned that its lofty valuation could make the stock vulnerable to a sharp pullback if the company delivers anything short of a blowout report. This in turn could dampen enthusiasm over other AI-related stocks that have helped power the market rally off its October 2022 low.\n\n\"It's been driven by excitement and enthusiasm around AI and of course the AI darling in the room is Nvidia,\" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\"Markets are looking at Nvidia with a little bit of anxiety, maybe, given that we have a market that's done so well and maybe in order to keep it going short term we need to see a good report from the leader in the space and that leader is Nvidia.\"\n\nUnofficially, the S&P 500 climbed 0.13% to end the session at 4,981.82 points.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 states with the best unemployment benefits in 2024. If you would like to skip our discussion on the US economy, you can go to the 5 States With the Best Unemployment Benefits in 2024.\n\nThe economic outlook for the United States remains uncertain, with the producer price index rising by 0.3% in January. This marked the most significant increase since August and was higher than the 0.1% forecast. Furthermore, the core producer price index, excluding food and energy, also experienced a higher-than-expected rise of 0.5%. While manufacturing activity, particularly in the production of high-tech goods like semiconductors, has seen a 23% YoY increase, economists at Morgan Stanley project a first-quarter GDP growth rate of 2%. However, they expect a decline in fourth-quarter GDP growth from 3.3% to 2.1%.\n\nConsumer sentiments, reflected in the University of Michigan consumer survey, indicate a slight rise above January levels, suggesting confidence in the economy. This sentiment persists despite the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items showing an increase for the 12 months ending January. The core CPI, excluding the food and energy components, experienced a 0.4% rise in January, keeping its year-over-year increase at 3.9%, consistent with the figures from December.\n\nThe forecast had predicted a 0.3% and a 3.7% rise, respectively. Shelter costs, representing roughly one-third of the CPI calculation, were a significant driver of the overall increase. The index for the shelter category increased by 0.6% for the month. On an annual basis, shelter costs saw a 6% increase. Similarly, the food index observed a 2.6% YoY increase in January, with month-on-month values rising by 0.4%. While the annual inflation rate is above the 2% benchmark set by the Federal Reserve, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) showed a 2.9% YoY growth in December.\n\nThere is an expectation that a potential recession might be deeper and stronger than initially forecasted, particularly with slowing wage growth rates. Keeping these circumstances in mind, there is increased focus on unemployment statistics, as individuals may suffer if employment lags. There are varying levels of concern amongst the states depending on the unemployment rates in different regions. In January, the unemployment rate in the US remained steady at 3.7% for the third consecutive month, with little change in the number of unemployed people, standing at 6.1 million. States with the lowest unemployment rates, such as Maryland and North Dakota, may be less worried, while states with the highest unemployment rates, like Nevada and the District of Columbia, are likely to experience a more significant impact. Major corporations such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have a key role to play in providing employment to a considerable number of people in the US. Interestingly, the technology sector made up 40% of the companies on the list of the best employers in 2023; in fact, six of the top ten employers were IT companies, highlighting the sector's leadership in offering attractive work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what Madison Investments said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was positive during the quarter but had a more modest gain in the fourth quarter following a strong third quarter and as a result, lagged the Technology sector more broadly. Alphabet’s third quarter included solid Search and You Tube results while Cloud growth was a bit softer, growing at 22% year-over-year. Google continues to incorporate AI in its core search businesses. It has been rolled out to a wide number of users across multiple geographies. We will continue to watch how Google adapts AI in its businesses and monitor cloud growth.” 15 States With the Best Unemployment Benefits in 2024\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 15 states with the best unemployment benefits in 2024, we made use of three weighted metrics, namely the cost of living index (weight of 0.3), the average weekly benefit weight of 0.4), and the number of weeks these benefits extend (weight of 0.3). We then ranked the best states for unemployment benefits on all three of these metrics. We then calculated a weighted average of states' rankings on these three metrics and adjusted the final rankings based on the weighted-average rankings. The states with the best unemployment benefits in 2024 have been ranked in descending order of rankings.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "(Recasts lead with Fed minutes, adds comment in paragraphs 5-7, updates prices at 3:20 p.m. (2020 GMT)\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Amanda Cooper\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped and Treasury yields rose on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting reaffirmed expectations that the U.S. central bank won't cut interest rates anytime soon.\n\nThe minutes kept sentiment subdued as investors awaited highly anticipated results from Nvidia after the market's close. The chipmaker's results and outlook could hinder or further fuel this year's rally in AI-related stocks.\n\nThe bulk of Fed policymakers were concerned about the risks of cutting rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level, minutes of the Jan. 30-31 session showed.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, rose 4.3 basis points to 4.655%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.47%.\n\n\"I don't think the minutes really told us anything new. The markets have basically already done the Fed's work for them in terms of pricing out chances of a March rate cut and for a bunch of cuts down the road,\" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.\n\nPolicymakers are concerned that the economy is going to limit further disinflationary trends, or at least has the potential to see progress on inflation stall out, she said.\n\n\"There's some very small risk of a hike that's been priced in just because of the hotter-than-expected inflation numbers\" last week, Rupert said.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters now expects the Fed to start cutting rates in June, farther out than market expectations last month of a first cut in March.\n\nMarkets now expect 91.5 basis points (bps) of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to the U.S. central bank's own projection of 75 bps of easing - or half the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks fell in Europe as shares in HSBC tumbled 8.4% in its biggest single-day decline since April 2020, after a shock $3 billion charge on its stake in a Chinese bank took the shine off record annual profit at the region's largest bank.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.17%.\n\nBut the day's focus is on Nvidia, whose shares have jumped 40% so far this year as of Tuesday's close.\n\nIf Nvidia only marginally meets or beats expectations the company will suffer dramatically as investors seek an excuse to pull back, at least in Big Tech, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. \"Nvidia is going to have to absolutely crush earnings and crush earnings expectations and probably deliver an above-expectations outlook for that stock to continue to move higher,\" he said.\n\n\"If Nvidia's report is lackluster and kicks off a decline in big tech or the overall S&P 500 by 5%-10%, I wouldn't change my outlook. That would be healthy for the market,\" Saglimbene said.\n\nNvidia is expected to post more than a threefold surge in fourth-quarter revenue on robust demand for its AI chips, which dominate the market.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.55%, the S&P 500 lost 0.56% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.07%.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has boosted the dollar and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-month lows.\n\nThe dollar index was flat, with the euro up 0.09% to $1.0813.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.15% to 150.21 per dollar.\n\nSteps by Chinese authorities to prop up economic growth in the world's largest raw materials consumer revived doubts about the growth outlook, which weighed on crude oil and iron ore.\n\nChinese blue-chip stocks posted a 1.4% gain on the day , a day after the biggest reduction yet in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to support the property market.\n\nOil prices rose 1% as geopolitical tensions raged on in the Middle East and traders assessed signs of near-term supply tightness.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) rose 87 cents to settle at $77.91 a barrel, while Brent crude settled up 69 cents to $83.03 a barrel.\n\nIron ore futures declined for a third consecutive session on Wednesday to their lowest in nearly four months.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Anisha Sircar in Bangalore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Ros Russell, Barbara Lewis, William Maclean and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "Checking the Average Zacks Price Target for Nvidia's Stock Before Earnings",
        "content": "Seeing if Nvidia (NVDA) can deliver on its lofty Q4 expectations after the closing bell today has been circulating through investors' minds. After all, high demand for its AI chips has boosted Nvidia’s stock over +200% in the last year and NVDA shares are already up +30% year to date.\n\nThe perplexity comes as NVDA shares have dipped more than -10% from their 52-week highs of $756.11 a share seen earlier in the month. Some investors may be contemplating on taking profits while others may be eying their entry point and wondering if the fall to under $700 a share is just a brief pause before Nvidia’s stock rips higher. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPrice Target & Broker Recommendations\n\nAwaiting the analysis of Nvidia’s Q4 results this evening investors may be scouring through analyst price targets. Based on the short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the Average Zacks Price Target of $724.19 a share currently implies 7% upside with NVDA shares down roughly -3% to around $674 a share in this morning's trading session.\n\nNotably, 35 out of 40 brokerage firms covering Nvidia’s stock and offering data to Zacks have a strong buy rating at the moment with 2 at a buy and 3 at a hold. This gives Nvidia a very favorable ABR (average broker recommendation) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQ4 Expectations & Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nTaking a last look at Nvidia’s Q4 projections before results this evening the Zacks Consensus for earnings is at $4.55 per share which would represent 417% growth from $0.88 per share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales are projected to increase 235% to $20.31 billion.\n\nOverall, Nvidia is expected to round out its fiscal 2024 with annual earnings climbing 270% to $12.36 per share and total sales increasing 119% to $59.13 billion. More importantly, the trend of earnings estimate revisions has been positive with FY24 EPS estimates slightly up over the last 60 days while FY25 EPS estimates have risen 3%.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile investors may be on edge for Nvidia’s Q4 results the number of brokers recommending its stock is very reassuring. To that point, Nvidia’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) attributed to rising earnings estimate revisions and a post-earnings rally wouldn’t be surprising if the chip giant can reach or exceed its lofty Q4 expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, Nvidia has riden a wave of excitement around artificial intelligence to become the world’s most valuable chipmaker.\n\n04:56 PM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 closes down\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down by 0.73pc today.

Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.\n\nLate last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed “Q-Day,” both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography.\n\nWashington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed “catch now, crack later.”\n\nIBM executive Ana Paula Assis has warned that quantum computing could cause a “cybersecurity armageddon.”\n\n04:30 PM GMT\n\nPrivate spacecraft reaches moon\n\nA moon lander built by Houston-based company Intuitive Machines reached lunar orbit today, headed for an attempt at the first US touchdown on Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor in more than 50 years, and the first ever by a private spacecraft.\n\nThe six-legged Nova-C lander, dubbed Odysseus, entered a circular orbit 57 miles above the lunar surface after firing its main rocket thruster for nearly seven minutes in an orbital insertion maneuver, the company said in an online statement.\n\nAssuming all goes according to plan, the robot spacecraft is expected to gradually lower its orbit over the next 24 hours and land at crater Malapert A near the moon’s south pole 10:49pm (UK time) on Thursday, carrying a suite of NASA science instruments and technology demonstrations.\n\nOdysseus was launched six days ago, on February 15, atop a Falcon 9 rocket built and flown by Elon Musk’s SpaceX from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nIt would mark the first “soft landing” on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle.

Will it see more competition, and could this eat away at revenues in the future? If yes, then we could see a lot of volatility for markets in the coming days.\n\nBut, if Nvidia signals that the future is rosy, then we could expect another leg higher in the recent rally.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nAn interim review of the Cabenuva treatment revealed the jab is better at suppressing HIV for patients who struggle to take a pill every day.\n\nThis could include patients who do not have stable insurance policies or those who worry that taking pills could disclose the existence of their condition.\n\nThe NHS says people diagnosed with HIV typically take between one and four pills a day.\n\nHowever, the Cabenuva treatment works through two-monthly injections and helps make the level of HIV in the blood undetectable, which significantly reduces the risk of transmitting the infection through sex. It is available in the UK on the NHS.\n\nDr Kimberly Smith, the head of research and development at GSK-controlled ViiV Healthcare, said: “The interim data indicating the superiority of long-acting therapy compared to daily oral therapy in individuals who have difficulty taking pills for HIV every day is a remarkable outcome.\n\n“Optimising therapy for all people living with HIV, including those with adherence challenges, is critical to the effort to end the HIV epidemic.”\n\nIt comes as GSK pushes ahead with plans to bolster its long-acting HIV drug portfolio.\n\nIt expects around 40pc of its HIV business to come from long-acting therapies within the next four or five years.\n\nViiv Healthcare, which Pfizer also has a minority stake in, is currently working on making it possible for people to inject their treatments at home so that they do not have to visit clinics every month.\n\nIt said last year it was planning to start clinic trials for a self-administered injection in 2026.\n\nIt is also working on a potential cure for HIV that will essentially wake up the virus within people’s immune cells and then allow them to be targeted.

The shares fell as much as much as 6.4pc in morning trading but are now down by just 0.93pc. Matt Oliver has more on the news that caused City jitters:\n\nThe FTSE 100 company on Wednesday said core earnings tumbled from 2022’s record $34bn (£27bn) to $17bn last year, as the thermal coal boom that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine petered out.\n\nAt the same time, Glencore’s net debts have ballooned from $75m to nearly $5bn following its takeover of the coal division of Teck Resources last year.\n\nGary Nagle, the miner’s chief executive, said the company was now “managing the balance sheet” and would scale back returns to shareholders, cutting the full-year dividend from $6.5bn to $1.6bn.\n\nFor the first time in years, the company is also not launching any share buybacks. It follows the bumper returns of $7.1bn pledged to investors in 2023, however.\n\nThe slowdown comes after energy and commodity prices became less volatile than in the immediate aftermath of the Ukraine war’s outbreak, while Glencore’s deal to buy Teck’s steelmaking coal business is placing extra pressure on the company’s finances.\n\nBut Mr Nagle insisted that current market prices meant the business was expected to be  “highly cash generative” in 2024, which “augurs well” for future dividend payouts and buybacks”.\n\nHe added: “As the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, we remain focused on supporting the energy needs of today whilst investing in our transition commodities portfolio.”\n\nIt comes as Glencore is preparing to offer shareholders a choice on whether to demerge its consolidated coal assets into a separate business, following the Teck deal.\n\nThe company and Nagle have also been criticised by the activist investor Bluebell Capital, which claimed that the thermal coal and steelmaking coal businesses would only have limited compatibility.

Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, says there is evidence that the merger may cause increased mobile bills - Geoff Pugh\n\n02:53 PM GMT\n\nPound unmoved by record Treasury surplus\n\nThe pound held steady despite the Treasury reporting the highest ever monthly surplus in the public finances in January ahead of the Budget next month.\n\nThe Government ran a budget surplus of $16.7bn last month as self-assessment returns led to record tax income, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIt was nearly double the £7.5bn surplus in the same month last year but below economists’ expectations of £18.4bn.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director XTB, said the record surplus does not mean the economy is out of the woods and generating cash significantly faster than before. She said:\n\nEconomic growth is still likely to remain sluggish, so today’s data is unlikely to factor into the Bank of England’s decision on when to cut rates.\n\nHowever, the question about tax cuts is now getting interesting.\n\nThe surplus meant that the Government has borrowed £9.2bn less than the OBR had forecast it would by this point in the financial year, handing Chancellor Jeremy Hunt potential room for giveaways in his Budget.\n\nThe pound was flat against the dollar at $1.26 and was also little changed against the euro at 85p.\n\n02:35 PM GMT\n\nUS markets slump amid worries for AI rally\n\nWall Street’s main indexes opened lower  ahead of chip designer Nvidia’s crucial earnings report that could potentially hinder or further fuel this year’s AI-led rally.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 80.14 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 38,483.66.\n\nThe S&P 500 opened lower by 12.48 points, or 0.3pc, at 4,963.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 98.66 points, or 0.6pc, to 15,532.12 at the opening bell.\n\n02:19 PM GMT\n\nSweden hits out at Greta Thunberg’s ‘flight shaming’ movement\n\nSweden’s government has hit out at the country’s net zero “flight shaming” movement as it announced a £76m cash injection for the airline industry.\n\nOur economics reporter Melissa Lawford has the details:\n\nInfrastructure minister Andreas Carlson said the government would invest more than one billion kronor to support carriers as they struggle to recover from the pandemic, high energy prices and the economic toll from Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nMr Carlson told reporters: “There are few reasons to feel flight shame and as the [green] transition increases there will be even fewer.”\n\nHis words refuted the Swedish concept of “flygskam”. The movement, which began in 2018 and literally means “flight shame”, has led the public to forego air travel because of the guilt associated with the carbon emissions.\n\nIt was spearheaded by activist Greta Thunberg, who in 2019 took a two-week journey across the Atlantic on a 60-foot racing yacht so that she could arrive at the UN’s Climate Summit in New York without travelling by air.\n\nRead how government policy has changed.

She said:\n\nDespite an easing in inflation and some real wage recovery, consumption remains below its pre-pandemic level.\n\nThis is in striking contrast to the euro area and the United States where consumption bounced back some time ago.\n\nThe evidence to err on the side of overtightening is not compelling in my view as it often comes with hard landings and scarring of supply capacity that would weigh further on living standards.\n\n01:49 PM GMT\n\nAldi plans to create 5,500 jobs as shoppers switch to discounters\n\nAldi is to create 5,500 new jobs this year as the supermarket chain continues its expansion across the UK as shoppers switch to cheaper retailers.\n\nThe UK’s fourth largest supermarket group said it is hiring for roles including store assistants, manager and cleaners across new shops.\n\nAldi UK is also recruiting across its 11 regional distribution centres and for head office positions.\n\nIt comes as figures from Nationwide showed British shoppers spent 41pc more at discount stores by value in January this year than the same month in 2023.\n\nAldi said store and warehouse assistant will receive a starting salary of £12 an hour, rising to £12.95 nationally, with those within the M25 receiving £13.55, rising to £13.85.\n\nIt currently has more than 1,000 stores and employs more than 45,000 workers.\n\nThe business has said it plans to grow to 1,500 stores in the coming years, after previously setting a goal of 1,200 shops by the end of 2025.\n\nIt comes a week after committing to spending £550m on opening new stores and upgrading existing ones in the UK this year. Aldi has announced plans to create 5,500 jobs this year - Chris Urso/Tampa Bay Times via AP\n\n01:35 PM GMT\n\nIMF criticised for forecasts 'from their perch in Washington'\n\nA senior MP has taken aim at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its refusal to allow the Government to analyse its predictions for UK economic growth.\n\nThe body predicted economic growth of just 0.6pc in the UK this year, the second slowest rate in the G7 after Germany.\n\nThe Treasury Select Committee will today question a panel of leading economic forecasters on the predictions which shape expectations around UK economic policy.\n\nChairman Harriett Baldwin said:\n\nWe also invited the OECD and the IMF to this session on economic forecasting.\n\nI’m disappointed neither has accepted our invitation to come to Westminster ahead of the Spring Budget and discuss the assumptions which underpin their forecasts on the UK economy.\n\nI am heartened, however, by the positive intent and engagement shown by the OECD during our discussions. We will continue to work with them to find a suitable time for a public session when schedules allow, to ensure proper democratic scrutiny of their work can be carried out.\n\nOn the contrary the IMF’s outright refusal to let us scrutinise their forecasts of the UK economy in public is infuriating. Yet they continue to utter public pronouncements about the UK from their perch in Washington.

It was last trading just below $82.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said:\n\nNews that fuel prices have bottomed out and are now on the rise again is bad news for drivers, and possibly the economy and future inflation rates, too.\n\nWhile we’re not expecting prices to shoot up dramatically, it appears that oil is trading up, which in the absence of a stronger pound, means wholesale fuel costs more for retailers to buy in. The result is higher prices at the pump and more expense for the every-day driver.\n\nThe Red Sea attacks by Houthi rebels, which are forcing tankers to avoid the Suez Canal and instead go round South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, are clearly playing their part, but so have global refinery maintenance closures, the start of America’s driving season and UK retailers buying more fuel stocks ahead of the Budget to protect against a possible fuel duty hike by the Chancellor.\n\n11:49 AM GMT\n\nGermany 'in difficult waters' as government slashes growth predictions\n\nThe German government has drastically cut back its growth forecast for Europe’s largest economy as it battles the impact of high inflation and a likely recession.\n\nThe cabinet of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s administration today approved its annual economic report, which expects the economy to grow by just 0.2pc this year, according to Reuters.\n\nIt is far less than previous predictions of 1.3pc and comes after Germany’s economy shrank by 0.3pc last year.\n\nCentral bank the Bundesbank said it is “likely” that the country has fallen into a recession in the first three months of this year.\n\n“The German economy continues to find itself in difficult waters at the beginning of the year,” said a draft of the report seen by Reuters.\n\nIt listed high inflation and a resulting loss of purchasing power among the challenges, as well as geopolitical crises and interest rate hikes.

The write-down of BoCom follows a similar pattern to what Standard Chartered did last quarter and while loan loss charges were better than expected, the Chinese commercial real estate sector continues to be weak.\n\n08:06 AM GMT\n\nUK markets open lower amid fading rate cut hopes\n\nThe FTSE 100 has begun the day lower following declines on Wall Street and on Asian markets.\n\nThe UK’s blue chip index was down 0.4pc after the open to 7,686.83 while the midcap FTSE 250 was little changed at 19,110.67.\n\n07:56 AM GMT\n\nBorrowing boost won't give Hunt cash to splash, warn economists\n\nA record surplus in January and lower than expected borrowing do not mean Jeremy Hunt will be able to spend big in his Budget next month, economists have warned.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said:\n\nJanuary’s public finances figures delivered some much-needed good news for the Chancellor in the lead-up to the Budget on March 6.\n\nBut we doubt this will pave the way for a big pre-election splash.\n\nWe think the Chancellor will be handed “headroom” of just £15bn (0.5pc of GDP), limiting his ability to unveil big unfunded tax cuts if he wishes to adhere to the fiscal rules.\n\nGora Suri, economist at PwC UK, added: “With the OBR’s final forecast assumptions now locked in, Hunt is likely to have limited scope for tax cuts or additional spending compared to his predecessors.\n\n“The Chancellor may have more headroom than the OBR expected in November, due to falls in market expectations for interest rates and gilt yields, but lower tax revenues from a smaller cash economy may push headroom down.”\n\n07:53 AM GMT\n\nHSBC suffers £2.4bn hit from China property crisis\n\nHSBC reported a sharp slide in final quarter profits after a $3bn (£2.4bn) writedown on its stake in a major Chinese bank.\n\nOur reporter Michael Bow has the details:\n\nThe bank’s pre-tax profits for the three month period ending December 2023 fell 80pc from $5bn to $1bn after it took the $3bn charge on its stake in Bank of Communication (BoCom).\n\nThe UK-based lender has held a 19pc stake in the Shanghai-based lender since 2004. The stake is seen as strategically important for HSBC but has raised questions from analysts about its value.\n\nHSBC cited “recent macroeconomic, policy and industry factors” for the impairment but said it had no plans to sell the BoCom stake.\n\n“BoCom remains a strong partner in China, and we remain focused on maximising the mutual value of our partnership. Our positive views on the medium and long-term structural growth opportunities in mainland China are unchanged,” it said.\n\nThe devaluation of the Argentine peso also hit profits by $500m. Argentina is suffering from hyperinflation due to the devaluation of the peso in December.\n\nThe $3bn writedown marred record annual profits for HSBC. HSBC revealed its China division suffered a $3bn blow at the end of last year - Lam Yik/Bloomberg\n\n07:51 AM GMT\n\nHunt could have £21bn of extra headroom on Treasury books, say economists\n\nMichal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK, said the public finances were “flattered” by the drop in grants and subsidies but said that the OBR would likely upgrade its outlook for the Treasury. He said:\n\nThe latest set of data suggests that borrowing could end 2023-24 at £114 billion.\n\nWe expect the OBR to upgrade its fiscal outlook on the back of a weaker expected path for interest rates, lower spending on inflation-linked debt, as well as a possible upward revision to their net migration assumptions, which are net positive for the public finances.\n\nThis could increase the headroom to meet the fiscal mandate to £21bn, up from £13bn at the Autumn Statement.\n\nThe policy choice lies between fiscal pragmatism and a stated desire to cut taxes.\n\nAccounting for the customary fuel duty freeze could leave the Chancellor with around £14bn to play with.\n\nThis would be enough to afford a 2p cut to the basic rate of Income Tax, also benefitting the pensioners who could not take advantage of the recent reduction in the National Insurance contributions.\n\nHowever, it would inevitably come at a cost of a greater constrain on future policy options. Navigating this delicate balance will be a tricky task in an election year.\n\n07:48 AM GMT\n\nDebt interest bill falls by £28.9bn\n\nGovernment spending rose by £67.5bn in the first ten months of the financial year, hitting £944bn, but the picture could have been much worse.\n\nThe Treasury saved £28.9bn over the period on debt interest payments as inflation fell back from 41-year highs experienced in October 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government spent £12.9bn less on subsidies, mainly because of the reduction in energy support costs.\n\n07:32 AM GMT\n\nEconomy is beginning to turn a corner, says minister\n\nAs the latest Government borrowing figures were published, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said:\n\nWe provided hundreds of billions to pay wages, support business and protect lives during Covid, and to pay half of people’s energy bills after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut we can’t leave future generations to pick up the tab, which is why we have taken tough decisions to help reduce borrowing versus what the OBR expected in March.\n\nWhile we will not speculate over whether further reductions in tax will be affordable in the Budget, the economy is beginning to turn a corner, with inflation down from over 11pc to 4pc.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nGovernment debt hits 96.5pc of GDP\n\nWhile Government borrowing is much lower than expected so far this financial year, the Treasury’s overall debt remains at its highest levels in six decades, when compared to the size of Britain’s economy.\n\nPublic sector net debt excluding public sector banks was £2.64 trillion at the end of January, which is equivalent to about 96.5pc of UK GDP.\n\nThat is 1.8 percentage points higher than in January last year and remains at levels last seen in the early 1960s.\n\nPublic sector net debt was £2,646.5 billion at the end of January 2024 and was provisionally estimated at around 96.5% of the UK’s annual gross domestic product. pic.twitter.com/TuZCHofmO8\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 21, 2024\n\n07:27 AM GMT\n\nGovernment reduced spending amid falling interest payments, says ONS\n\nONS deputy director for public sector Jessica Barnaby said:\n\nJanuary’s surplus is the largest in nominal terms since monthly records began in 1993, although borrowing in the year to January is only slightly lower than the same period last year.\n\nTax receipts are always higher in January than other months owing to self-assessed taxes, which often leads to a surplus.\n\nAlso, with recent reductions in the RPI rate, interest payable on government gilts and without last year’s government support schemes, overall expenditure was down on this time last year, despite increased spending on public services and benefits.\n\nAs a proportion of gross domestic product, public sector debt is up on the year, and remains at levels last seen in the 1960s.\n\n07:17 AM GMT\n\nHunt handed £9.2bn borrowing boost for Budget tax cuts\n\nJeremy Hunt has been handed a £9.2bn borrowing boost as he seeks potential pre-election giveaways for his Budget next month.\n\nGovernment borrowing came in at £96.6bn in the first ten months of the financial year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThis was lower than the official forecasts of spending by the OBR, which thought the Treasury would have borrowed £105.8bn by this point.\n\nThe extra headroom for the Chancellor comes as the public purse was boosted by a record surplus in January, which is traditionally a strong month as Britons file their tax returns.\n\nThe ONS recorded a £16.7bn surplus last month in the public finances, which was more than double the surplus last year and the largest surplus since monthly records began in 1993 in nominal terms.\n\nHowever, it was still below economists’ estimates of a surplus of £18.4bn.\n\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was £16.7 billion in surplus in January 2024.\r\n\r\nThis was more than double the surplus of January 2023 and the largest since monthly records began in 1993.\r\n\r\n➡️ https://t.co/Hz0LLO7Kbipic.twitter.com/iHQOT14JoY\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 21, 2024\n\n07:09 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s market-leading advance has left even the bulls questioning if an earnings beat will be enough to propel the AI chipmaker’s shares higher.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Top 2024 Deal US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nThe key now, for Nvidia and the entire market, is whether the company can meet revenue estimates and assure investors that it sees further growth in generative artificial intelligence. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk has called it “the most important stock on planet earth,” given its outsize influence on equity gains this year.\n\n“Nvidia has been the driver, the one stock that really set the tone,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “That’s why everybody is fascinated by this thing and if it can put up another bunch of numbers that are impressive.”\n\nNvidia shares slipped as much as 4.1% Wednesday, its fourth consecutive day of declines. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger announced that the company has a $15 billion foundry pipeline midday in New York. Shares of Intel were also down as much as 2.5% in intraday trading Wednesday.\n\nEven with this week’s declines, Nvidia boasts a market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion. It has the third-highest weighting in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., so a swing either way will add or erase billions of dollars in value for investors.\n\nThe stock is up about 35% in 2024, even with this week’s slip. That’s the biggest gain on the S&P 500 Index to start the year, and it builds on last year’s 239% surge, also topping the benchmark gauge. Nvidia has added more than $400 billion in market value just this year.\n\nWall Street expects another banner quarter, with more than $20 billion in revenue, a jump of nearly 240% from a year earlier and the third straight period of triple-digit-percent gains, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Nvidia reports earnings after Wednesday’s close.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Nvidia Options Signal Nearly $200 Billion Swing After Earnings\n\nThe market’s immediate response to Nvidia’s last two earnings announcements doesn’t inspire optimism. Shares fell after its November release, which failed to meet lofty expectations. And in August, a market rout erased nearly all of a rally from a blowout report. But in both cases, the shares eventually powered higher.\n\n“The stock always looks the most expensive right before they open their mouths,” said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, who sees further upward momentum given Nvidia’s leadership in AI. “It’s hard to say if you’re going to get paid on earnings day, but I don’t think that drastically matters.”\n\nWall Street is overwhelmingly bullish on the shares. The stock has 60 buy ratings, five holds and one sell, among analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The average 12-month price target of about $734 implies a roughly 8% gain.\n\nAt Piper Sandler, analysts led by Harsh Kumar expect a modest beat for revenue and earnings per share, and solid forward guidance for data-center revenue. But that still may not be enough to lift the shares, they said in a note last week.\n\nOn such a result, “we feel the stock would remain flattish given the recent run up over the prior two months paired with the extremely high expectations going into the print,” Kumar wrote in the note, in which they boosted their price target to $850 from $620.\n\nRead More: Goldman’s Rubner Says Nvidia Is Most Important Stock on Earth\n\nA post-earnings pullback wouldn’t be a surprise, said Bank of America Corp. analysts, even though they say the company’s performance supports the strength to start the year.\n\n“One interpretation of this Nvidia move is a mix of fear and greed and indiscriminate investor chase for all things AI,” BofA’s Vivek Arya wrote in a note last week reiterating that Nvidia is a top pick heading into earnings. “We acknowledge those factors, but believe it understates the company‘s solid execution and EPS revisions.”\n\nThere’s also a camp of investors that’s ready to pounce on the shares should they falter after Wednesday’s announcement.\n\n“Any sort of pullbacks are going to viewed as these limited windows where investors who are going to want to invest in AI for three-to-five years get a chance to buy it,” said Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset management.\n\nForward expectations for the company are so lofty that its valuation still looks relatively inexpensive. Nvidia trades at roughly 32 times forward earnings, compared with about 25 for the Nasdaq 100.\n\n“For a stock that’s up over 200% in the past year, it’s surprisingly still attractively priced,” Munster said.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech News\n\nNvidia’s earnings report is such a big event in markets that Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk has called it “the most important stock on planet earth.” Samsung Electronics Co. sold its entire remaining stake in ASML Holding NV in the December quarter as part of its push to expand into new areas of chipmaking. Amazon.com Inc. is finally joining the famous Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple Inc. shuffled leadership at the hardware team responsible for audio features on AirPods, Macs and other products, tapping a new leader for an increasingly critical business. Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc. plunged in premarket trading after the company cut its annual revenue forecast, sparking concerns that customers are reigning in tech spending.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nAnalog Devices Garmin Postmarket\n\nNvidia Synopsys Ansys Trip.com Rivian Etsy Lucid\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates stock moves, adds details about Intel Corp. in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) seems to be a major market influencer ahead of its earnings results due out after Wednesday's closing bell. The stock — a member of the Magnificent Seven — has certainly been a major tech driver, but do investors and ETFs have too much exposure on this AI darling?\n\nETF Think Tank Director of Research Cinthia Murphy sits down with Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on ETF themes boosted by Nvidia's success, and which types of ETFs are adjacent to artificial intelligence narratives.\n\n\"The worst thing you can do is be unaware of being really heavy on Nvidia. So go make sure if you have Nvidia... if you have a semiconductor ETF, and you have a Big Tech ETF, and have an AI ETF... and you have Nvidia across all of these exposures you may be really loaded on that single stock,\" Murphy explains. \"So now as we are acedf with a potential correction, if guidance disappoints today, you could really be in a position where you're overly exposed to it. Awareness is the first step here.

        "title": "Amazon addition helps Dow stay 'relevant'",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.\n\nOn Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\n\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you’re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that’s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\n\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120 year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\n\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that over the last several years with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\n\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy filing in October.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We don’t not like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.

Amazon.com is being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining Apple, Walt Disney, Walmart and other companies that make up the 30-stock average. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.\n\nPart of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.\n\nAmazon is now the third of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year. Meanwhile the Dow Jones has risen 16% in the same timeframe.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Adds dateline, byline, comment in paragraphs 5-7, updates prices at 10:50 a.m. (1550 GMT))\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Amanda Cooper\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global stocks slipped on Wednesday ahead of highly anticipated results from chipmaker Nvidia, while the dollar seesawed as investors await minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting for insight into potential interest rate cuts.\n\nSteps by Chinese authorities to prop up economic growth in the world's largest raw materials consumer revived doubts about the growth outlook, which weighed on crude oil and iron ore.\n\nIn Europe, stocks traded lower as shares in HSBC tumbled 8.6% after the region's largest bank reported a record annual profit that nonetheless missed analyst expectations.\n\nThe day's focus is on Nvidia, whose earnings are slated to be released after the U.S. market close. Results and its outlook could determine equity sentiment for weeks to come as AI-related stocks have driven much of this year's rally.\n\n\"Nvidia is going to have to absolutely crush earnings and crush earnings expectations and probably deliver an above expectations outlook for that stock to continue to move higher,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan.\n\nIf Nvidia, up 40% so far this year as of Tuesday's close, only marginally meets or beats expectations, it will suffer dramatically as investors are looking for an excuse to pull back, at least in Big Tech, he said.\n\n\"If Nvidia's report is lackluster and kicks off a decline in big tech or the overall S&P 500 by 5%-10%, I wouldn't change my outlook. That would be healthy for the market,\" Saglimbene said.\n\nNvidia, the third-largest company by market cap in the S&P 500, was down about 2.1%. The company is expected to post more than a three-fold surge in fourth-quarter revenue on robust demand for its AI chips, which dominate the market.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 0.30% to 745.92, while in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index slid 0.29%, pulled lower by HSBC.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.24%, the S&P 500 lost 0.28% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.66%.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's policy meeting in January will not capture last week's data on inflation, which revealed enough of an uptick to prompt investors to rethink when the Fed might cut interest rates.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters now expects the Fed to start cutting rates in June, farther out than market expectations last month of a first cut in March.\n\nMarkets now expect 91.5 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to the U.S. central bank's own projection of 75 bps of easing - or half the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 0.2 basis points to 4.273%. The two-year's yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, fell 0.6 basis points to 4.6061%.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has boosted the dollar and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-month lows.\n\nThe dollar index was down 0.01% at 104.03, with the euro up 0.0% at 1.0811. The dollar strengthened 0.09% at 150.12 against the Japanese yen.\n\nSterling shrugged off Britain's highest ever monthly budget surplus in January and traded flat on the day.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese blue-chip stocks posted a 1.4% gain on the day, a day after the biggest reduction yet in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to support the property market.\n\n\"Regulators are cautious and taking a gradual approach, with the possibility of introducing further measures if needed,\" said Jian Shi Cortesi, investment director of Asia/China Growth Equities of GAM Investments.\n\n\"The market sentiment has improved slightly, but the sustainability relies more on improvements in economic activities and corporate earnings.\"\n\nIn commodities, U.S. crude gained 0.16% to $77.16 a barrel and Brent rose to $82.43 per barrel on the day.\n\nIron ore futures declined for a third consecutive session on Wednesday to their lowest in nearly four months.\n\nThe most-traded May iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended daytime trade 3.98% lower at 893 yuan ($124.29) per metric ton, the lowest close since Oct. 31, after a more than 5% drop the day before.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Anisha Sircar in Bangalore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Ros Russell, Barbara Lewis, William Maclean)",

        "title": "Minutes of January FOMC Meet Expected Before Closing Bell",
        "content": "This Hump Day, we play the waiting game, for the most part. One of the most conspicuous companies on Wall Street — NVIDIA NVDA, the leader of the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks, +230% over the past year — reports Q4 earnings after today’s closing bell. While this company had been priced for perfection, running up to fresh all-time highs one week ago, we’ve seen traders pull back in the past couple days, including a -2% drop in today’s pre-market.\n\nExpectations are still high for the graphics processing innovator, which has built itself up to the third-largest publicly traded corporation by market cap, behind just Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. NVIDIA’s ubiquity is by now well known: we wouldn’t have video games, cryptocurrency, generative AI, etc. to the extent we currently understand them without NVIDIA supplying GPUs to these sub-industries. Earnings estimates are currently projected to have risen over +400% year over year.\n\nYesterday’s -4.5% selloff was the biggest single-day drop for NVIDIA thus far in 2024. This serves a dual purpose for market participants ahead of this afternoon’s report: a.) either NVIDIA posts a surprise that is less than the +22.4% trailing three-quarter average earnings beat, thereby disappointing investors and sending the stock into a bigger selloff, or b.) it provides a springboard higher in the case of better-than-expected earnings results later today.\n\nAlso later today, but before the closing bell rings, minutes for the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be made public, allowing analysts to parse the language and opinion of members on how hot or cold the Fed was as of January 31st. These news events have in the past been useful tools in predicting further Fed action, but key jobs and inflation reports (Employment Situation, CPI, PPI, etc.) have been more decidedly in one direction — hotter — than speculation had been as of late last month. In short, no Fed minutes are likely to increase the odds of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting, which ends March 20th.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot exactly a direct competitor to NVIDIA, but a major semiconductor producer nevertheless, Analog Devices ADI reported fiscal Q1 results ahead of today’s open. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated company beat expectations slightly on both top and bottom lines — +2 cents to $1.73 per share on $2.51 billion in sales, better than the $2.50 billion in the Zacks consensus — but guidance for the coming quarter were lower than previous estimates on both top and bottom lines. Shares are trading down -1% in today’s early session. The stock is -2% year to date.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "All Eyes on Nvidia Earnings: Here's What to Expect",
        "content": "A shortened trading week brings another busy earnings slate, with more than 900 companies on deck to report quarterly results. While many of the top retail names will provide a glimpse on the health of the U.S. consumer and overall spending, we have one final tech giant from the Magnificent 7 that has yet to deliver its Q4 marks. The long-awaited results out of Nvidia NVDA are scheduled for today after the close, and investors are eager to see how the chip giant performed in the latest quarter.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have led the way over the past year. Robust demand for products that run cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) has boosted investor appetite for companies that produce the chips.\n\nNvidia has been at the forefront of the generative AI conversation, as the company headlines the graphics chips that are designed for complex computing applications. Several of Nvidia’s customers include fellow members of the Magnificent 7, including Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, as they require thousands of AI chips to run their own advanced offerings.\n\nNvidia offers solutions for gaming platforms, enterprise workstations, software for cloud-based virtual computing and 3-D design, and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. A top dog in the AI space, Nvidia also provides data center platforms and systems for use in autonomous driving, accelerated computing, cryptocurrency mining, and robotics.\n\nNvidia Surpasses Amazon and Alphabet\n\nConsidered most preferred by datacenter operators, Nvidia’s GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space. Companies like Amazon and Alphabet are expanding their global operations, driving demand for NVDA chips. By applying its GPUs in AI models, Nvidia is expanding its base in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing.\n\nJust this past week, Nvidia passed by both Alphabet and Amazon in market capitalization. The chip giant became the 3rd most valuable company in the United States:\n\nStory continues YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nNvidia’s revenues (on a trailing twelve-month basis) of $45 billion pale in comparison to Alphabet ($307 billion) and Amazon ($575 billion), so we can see the astronomically high expectations that investors have for Nvidia moving forward. YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nNvidia also recently disclosed investments in its first-ever 13F filing with the SEC, providing investors with a glimpse of its long-term growth plan. Perhaps the most notable investment that Nvidia disclosed was a nearly $150 million stake in British chip designer Arm Holdings ARM. The company also disclosed stakes in SoundHound AI SOUN, a developer of AI software that is tailored to vocal recognition, and Nano-X Imaging NNOX, which develops artificial intelligence applications used in medical imaging.\n\nNVDA Stock Performance\n\nNVDA stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares exploded nearly 240% last year and have already added another 38% this year. The stock continues to trade above the widely-followed 50-day and 200-day moving averages, but has pulled back a bit heading into the earnings announcement. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nAs earnings and revenues have soared over the past few quarters, the stock has become overvalued based on traditional metrics. With this latest rally, Nvidia now trades at more than 40 times current sales, which is the highest ever for a company of its size. We can see that this figure far exceeds the current price to sales ratio of both Alphabet (6x) and Amazon (3x). YCharts\n\nImage Source: YCharts\n\nIt goes to show that investors are willing to pay a premium price for Nvidia shares, as the growth trend is expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future.\n\nFourth-Quarter Earnings Estimates\n\nNvidia is looking to resume what has been a long history of earnings beats. Analysts covering NVDA have revised their estimates for Q4 upward by 1.34% over the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $4.54/share, reflecting an astonishing potential growth rate of 416% relative to the year-ago period. Revenues are anticipated to grow 234% to $20.2 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThese are phenomenal growth rates for a company of this size, and it’s no wonder that Nvidia’s stock continues to reward investors with massive outperformance. The stock was the leading performer last year out of all S&P 500 constituents.\n\nNvidia torched earnings estimates in 2023, surpassing even the most optimistic projections. The semiconductor leader has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%. After the company reported its latest (Q3) results, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions – accelerated computing and generative AI.”\n\nBottom Line\n\nTechnology tends to underperform in bear markets and outperform in bull markets. That’s undoubtedly been the case between the 2022 bear market and the current bull market. Strong earnings projections, technological outperformance, and a bullish AI theme all point to continued strength in semiconductors.\n\nStill, stocks in this group appear extended in the short-term, so investors will be watching closely to see how they react to the upcoming announcement from Nvidia.\n\nDisclosure: NVDA is a current holding in the Zacks Headline Trader portfolio.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy.\n\nMarkets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.\n\n\"Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,\" UBS economists said in a note.\n\nUBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.\n\nThe era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.\n\nLord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish \"pivot\" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.\n\n\"Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A “bull-steepening” environment, like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,\" the report added.\n\nStory continues 12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy\n\nImage: Depositphotos\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify NYSE stocks trading under $5. From the resultant data set we picked 12 penny stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12.

(NYSE:ETWO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“E2open Parent Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ETWO) reported much lower-than-expected forward guidance when it announced its fiscal 2023 results. Given the tailwinds that other supply chain software companies are taking advantage of, we lost confidence in the company’s current ability to execute and closed the position. We continue to view the supply chain software space favorably and would consider revisiting the stock in the future.”\n\n10. Nextdoor Holdings Inc (NYSE:KIND)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nHyperlocal social networking platform company Nextdoor Holdings Inc (NYSE:KIND) ranks tenth in our list of the best NYSE penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Earlier this week in New Delhi, my team held a signing ceremony with Rahul Bhatia, the Group Managing Director of InterGlobe, to announce our plans to work with InterGlobe to bring safe, sustainable and low-noise electric air taxi services to some of the most highly populated cities in the world. As part of the initiative, we will work with InterGlobe to set up an entity and will work with select in-country business partners to operate Archer’s Aircraft, enhance and build vertiport infrastructure, and train pilots and other personnel needed for these operations.\n\nInterGlobe and Archer also anticipate the purchase of up to 200 of our Midnight aircraft as we bring up operations. India is an incredibly important market for eVTOL, and it has the potential to be one of the largest in the world, with Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai being our initial focus where congestion costs cities over $22 billion annually. In these cities, traffic congestion contributes to 20% to 25% of the outdoor pollution, and I hope that Archer can be a part of reducing that over the next decade. I founded Archer to help give back time to millions of people and to make cities smarter, better, cleaner, more efficient places to live. Now that Midnight is flying and we are well along the pathway to commercialization, it’s clear that major cities around the world have the same goals as Archer does.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6.

The chip giant's earnings could be a make or break moment for markets, which pulled back after hotter than expected inflation data. That's only furthering hopes that NVIDIA could turn things around. So can they?\n\nWell, the bar is really high. The stock is up about 47% this year, which made Nvidia surpass both Amazon and Alphabet in market cap. And this comes after Nvidia rallied by over 200% in 2023. All that rallying means Nvidia has gotten pricey. If forward guidance doesn't justify the company's valuation, the AI- powered Nvidia balloon could pop.\n\nOne Bank of America analyst said while any post-earnings moves from Nvidia would be notable, they'd also be brief. Now that could be due to the company's revenue, which is expected to triple this quarter to over $20 billion. Now for context, the company's full year revenue in 2023 was $27 billion, the increase primarily due to data center revenue, which accounts for about 80% of Nvidia's sales. Wedbush analysts are zeroing in on those data center sales, which they expect to deliver good news this week. Regardless of the outcome, investors seem to agree on one thing-- it will be market moving.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]",

        "content": "(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.)\n\n*\n\nFocus on Nvidia results due later in the day\n\n*\n\nPalo Alto craters after Q3 billings forecast misses estimates\n\n*\n\nSolarEdge slumps on downbeat Q1 revenue forecast\n\n*\n\nFutures down: Dow 0.21%, S&P 0.32%, Nasdaq 0.61%\n\n(Updated at 8:38 a.m. ET/ 1338 GMT)\n\nBy Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar\n\nFeb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street was headed for a lower open on Wednesday ahead of chip designer Nvidia's high-stakes earnings report that could potentially hinder or further fuel this year's AI-led rally, and as investors awaited minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.\n\nNvidia shed 1.9% in premarket trading after a more than 4% decline in the prior session ahead of the semiconductor firm's quarterly earnings, expected after markets close on Wednesday.\n\nThe company is expected to post a more than three-fold surge in its fourth-quarter revenue on robust demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAnalysts have warned that Nvidia's lofty valuation could make it vulnerable to sharp declines if it delivers anything short of a blowout report and also spark a broader selloff among other technology firms that have benefited from bets on AI.\n\n\"(Nvidia) is seen as the lead company in the AI revolution,\" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey.\n\n\"With these elevated prices in the megacap tech space, there's clearly nervousness about any level of disappointment. Nvidia really needs to not only beat, but have a very strong forecast for it to reaccelerate to the upside.\" The chipmaker has jumped 40.2% so far this year, compared with 6.7% and 4.1% year-to-date gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe AI-fueled rally on Wall Street this year ran into a rough patch after data last week hinted at sticky inflation and stoked concerns that the Federal Reserve could delay the start of its rate easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing below the 5,000-point level.\n\nMinutes from the Fed's January monetary policy meeting, due at 1400 ET (1900 GMT), will offer further clues on the timing of potential interest rate cuts. Investors will also watch out for comments from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman on Wednesday.\n\nA majority of traders are currently pricing in June as the starting point for rate easing, compared with March at the start of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nAt 08:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 81 points, or 0.21%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 15.75 points, or 0.32%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 107 points, or 0.61%.\n\nAdding to the declines, Palo Alto Networks slumped 24.1% in trading before the bell after the cybersecurity firm forecast third-quarter billings below Wall Street estimates, signaling cautious spending by businesses.\n\nShares of other cybersecurity companies such as Fortinet , Zscaler and Crowdstrike Holdings fell between 7% and 10%.\n\nAmazon.com gained 0.7%, with the company set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective next week, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance. Shares of Walgreens slipped 2.8%.\n\nRenewable energy firm SolarEdge Technologies dropped 17.9% after it projected first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "3 Overlooked Semiconductor Stocks to Watch Now",
        "content": "Top AI semiconductor stocks have been hot through 2023, and so far this year, they’re showing no signs of cooling off as the newest slate of generative AI technologies continues to impress. OpenAI recently showcased Sora, an AI video generator that’s been the talk of the town over the past week.\n\nUndoubtedly, one can’t help but think that products such as ChatGPT and Sora OpenAI are going to put many folks out of a job. Perhaps most impressive is that ChatGPT and Sora can only get better from here. I think that just having a look at the videos Sora generated is enough to make an AI believer out of any investor.\n\nAs OpenAI’s top boss, Sam Altman, looks to raise as much as $7 trillion (yes, that’s a trillion with a “t”) to give the global semiconductor industry a boost, it seems like semiconductor demand could continue to outweigh supply as we enter AI’s second year of mass adoption. Let’s take a peek at three overlooked semiconductor stocks to watch closely as they continue their ascent.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemiconductor Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those who may have missed out on the semiconductor boom of 2023, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) definitely stands out as a catch-up play that’s nowhere near as hot as some of its high-flying peers. At around $152 per share, Qualcomm is still down just over 19% from its 2022 all-time high. Given the ongoing AI boom, it’s hard to envision a semiconductor stock with AI exposure that’s not melting up to new highs.\n\nThough, there are some question marks clouding Qualcomm’s future. Most notably, what happens when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) successfully creates its own modem, a move that would essentially give Qualcomm’s modem the boot from a future iPhone model?\n\nAs it turns out, making cellular modems is no easy feat. And with Apple extending its modem deal with Qualcomm through 2026, it seems like Apple’s foray into modems has been a tad rockier than anticipated. Only time will tell if Apple is able to replace Qualcomm in a few years. Regardless, expect Qualcomm to be less reliant on Apple over time as it looks to make a deeper dive into the world of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 21.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), QCOM stock certainly looks cheaper than most other semiconductor stocks hogging the headlines of late.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) found itself flirting with all-time highs before slipping by around 5% over the past week and change. As critical as the firm is to the future of the AI chip market, you wouldn’t expect the firm to be overlooked. Undoubtedly, it’s the uncertain geopolitical risks making shares of TSM a tough hold, even as the firm itself continues firing on all cylinders in a market that couldn’t be hotter.\n\nIt’s the same deal with owning Chinese stocks; there are a lot of geopolitical risks with these investments. And though TSM stock’s valuation may be depressed, it’s tough to tell just how much of a discount warrants a potential bear-case scenario that sees China invade Taiwan.\n\nOn the plus side, Taiwan Semiconductor is doing a great job of expanding beyond Taiwan. The world’s largest foundry is set to build a second factory in Japan, a move that could take a little bit of the China-Taiwan risk off the table.\n\nArguably, it’ll take much more than just another factory opening to ease this risk. In any case, I view any potential escalation in China-Taiwan tensions as a risk, not just for Taiwan Semiconductor but the entire tech sector. With that in mind, I view TSM stock as incredibly cheap at just 24.5 times trailing P/E.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe secret is out: AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the AI chip bet for investors who want a suitable alternative to the great Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Though AMD isn’t overlooked anymore, after recently surging to new all-time highs, I think a strong case could be made for why the stock deserves more attention than top rival Nvidia as they look to battle it out at the front lines in the so-called AI war.\n\nOver the past year, AMD stock has been white-hot, up more than 121%. As jaw-dropping as the gain is, the performance still comes up short of Nvidia, which has more than tripled over the same time span. With the better chips, the better past year of performance, and the better valuation (96.2 times trailing P/E for NVDA stock vs. 334.4 times trailing P/E for AMD stock), why bother going with player number two (AMD) over the top dog (Nvidia)?\n\nAMD seems to be giving its all to challenge its AI chip rivals with an arsenal of new chip releases (like the Strix Point APUs for 2024).\n\nFurther, the company’s sheer hunger for Nvidia’s massive slice of the pie ought to be enough to justify diversifying into if you’re overweight in any single AI stock. Whether AMD can grab a big slice of Nvidia’s lunch remains to be seen. In any case, fellow InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald has high hopes for AMD as it looks to continue its “aggressive” move into AI chips.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Apple.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to numerous technological progressions, making 2023 a breakout year for tech companies providing AI-related products and services. Yet, skeptics are concerned about the growth of AI in 2024 as it’s an expensive undertaking and requires chips that are presently in short supply.\n\nHowever, market experts believe that the AI market will grow this year and beyond as it will successfully bridge the gap between humans and machines. AI is likely to lead to technological breakthroughs in handling various data, texts, videos and images.\n\nAI is expected to increase cerebral aptitudes with tools including virtual aids, personalized references and language understanding. Many prominent financial firms also expect AI integration to boost labor productivity and economic growth in the coming years.\n\nWith AI poised to modernize business processes, and create a congenial business environment, its market is projected to reach $305.9 billion by the end of this year, and the United States will have the largest market size, per Statista.\n\nIn reality, the AI market is estimated to witness a compound annual growth rate of 15.83% from 2024 to 2030, and eventually touch a market volume of $730.8 by 2030, added Statista.\n\nThanks to the AI boom, not only the tech bigwigs but also a slew of tech companies gained traction in recent times. Bespoke Investment Group added that all 67 stocks related to AI listed on the S&P 500 Index have soared 45.3% on average since November 2022, whereas the remaining 433 non-AI stocks advanced only 9.2% in the same period.\n\nWhat’s more, the AI-related group of stocks on the S&P 500 has gained an average of 3.7% year to date, more than non-AI stocks’ average gain of 1.1%.\n\nThus, banking on solid growth prospects in the field of AI, astute investors should keep an eye on AI-related industry-leading companies to reap handsome returns. Such players are Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Nvidia Corporation NVDA and International Business Machines Corporation IBM.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has transformed from only a search engine player to a cloud-computing provider. But it’s the Google search engine that has utilized AI to guide users to improve spelling while making search-related queries. At the same time, Alphabet’s products, including Gmail and Google Cloud, incorporate AI functionalities to offer various services to clients.\n\nAnyhow, Alphabet’s cloud division is playing a pivotal role in improving the company’s top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 1.7% over the past 60 days. GOOGL’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.7% and 11.1%, respectively. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNvidia was involved in providing graphic processors to PC manufacturers, a less lucrative market, for quite some time. However, the graphics processing unit market boomed on increased demand for AI services. Notably, the curiosity in AI came in after the launch of Open AI’s ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia does have competition from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, but its commitment to achieve cutting-edge technology, is keeping it way ahead of its competitors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 269.5% and 64.5%, respectively.\n\nIts estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 118.8% and 55.1%, respectively. NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nInternational Business Machines is known for having created one of the most powerful AI systems, such as Watson, which is used for data analysis and various kinds of decision-making. IBM did confirm that the demand for their software and services improved recently as more customers are using AI systems.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up nearly 3% over the past 60 days. IBM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 4.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively. IBM currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade as revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed over 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third-most-valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adjused EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Ruben Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.

        "title": "Semiconductor giant ASML is one of Europe’s most ‘overowned’ stocks, Morgan Stanley says—but it doesn’t necessarily signal the beginning of an AI bubble",
        "content": "ASML's AI-driven growth has lifted its stock to record highs, aligning with trends seen in Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm, but despite concerns of a bubble, current indications suggest otherwise.\n\nMorgan Stanley research positions ASML as the second most \"overowned\" European equity, following Novo Nordisk in the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nShares in the Dutch group have soared more than 20% since the start of the year, propelled by increased demand for chip technology on the back of fast-moving progress in AI and making it Europe’s most valuable European tech firm.\n\nASML manufactures hardware that manufacturers buy to produce their chips, giving the company a rising tide effect as orders pile up for other semiconductor producers.\n\nMorgan Stanley research, which tracks 277 investment funds worth a combined $1.2 trillion, would suggest that demand has pushed the semiconductor giant into overvalued territory, reaching near the top of the list for stocks among global fund managers.\n\nOverowned stocks are usually regarded as a negative signal, indicating their share price is higher than their underlying market value, and would assume a market correction is likely.\n\nAn AI bubble?\n\nAnalysts have been warning of a bubble for some time as markets defy months of high inflation and rising interest rates, as the S&P 500 rose more than 24% last year.\n\nThe AI sector has become an increasingly important microcosm of this trend.\n\nNvidia’s stock more than tripled in value last year, while a 40% bump this year helped propel the AI chip pioneer above Amazon to become the fourth most valuable company in the U.S.\n\nShares in Softbank-owned U.K. AI darling Arm jumped nearly 50% on the day it released third-quarter earnings that showed surprising levels of demand for its royalty-generating AI technologies.\n\nInvestors have piled their money into the most obvious benefactors of demand for AI, like tech companies and chip producers.\n\nOther sectors may reap the benefits too, with Goldman Sachs’ head of macro research in Europe, Peter Oppenheimer, comparing the buzz to the canal boom of the 18th century.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hype divided analysts last year, though fears appear to have died down since.\n\nIn August, DeVere Group CEO Nigel Green warned buzz around AI was reaching \"fever pitch\" as Nvidia galloped away.\n\n“This level of hype is dangerous as it could lead investors to assume that these stocks are a silver bullet to build long-term wealth,” he said. “And they are not, at least not on their own.”\n\nThe other trend that has pushed ASML into “overowned” territory, however, is likely a result of a growing herd mentality among investors in recent years, who have been keen to pile into a stock market that keeps returning huge gains.\n\nFund managers tend to select a collection of high-value stocks in an indexed form, with the stake in each company declining as it falls in value.\n\nThat helped the U.S.’s “Magnificent Seven” stock group, including Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla, which carried several S&P 500-tracking funds to positive returns last year.\n\nFor ASML, past trends suggest it could continue to ride this bullish wave for some time.\n\nMarina Zavolock, Morgan Stanley’s chief European equity strategist, said: “Overowned stocks are outperforming both the index and underowned stocks since the market lows of October, a typical occurrence in rising markets.\n\n“Interestingly, European funds' largest overweights have seen the best performance among the three fund groups from October lows and this has broadly been a trend since 2017.”\n\nASML loses Samsung\n\nNot everyone is joining the herd and piling into ASML stock, and the company is more likely to be concerned about its business fundamentals than fund managers’ behaviors as a chip war ensues across the globe.\n\nThe group was delivered a blow this week as Samsung announced it was withdrawing its entire 0.4% stake in ASML, Bloomberg first reported citing financial disclosures from the South Korean tech giant.\n\nThe group is also facing a challenge from camera and printer producer Canon, which is hoping to undercut ASML with $150 million chipmaking machines.\n\nShares in the Dutch semiconductor giant have dipped in value by more than 3% in the last week.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks ease ahead of Nvidia reality check, Fed minutes",
        "content": "(Updates prices at 1240 GMT)\n\nBy Amanda Cooper\n\nLONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global shares edged lower on Wednesday ahead of earnings from Nvidia, which many are anticipating will justify the hype around 2024's AI-driven rally, and of the minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting.\n\nIn commodities, steps by Chinese authorities to prop up economic growth in the world's largest raw materials consumer have revived doubts about the growth outlook, which weighed on crude oil and iron ore.\n\nStocks in Europe traded down on the day, as shares in HSBC fell 7% after the region's largest bank reported a record annual profit that missed analyst expectations.\n\nThe STOXX 600 was down 0.1%, but within sight of record highs. The MSCI All-World fell 0.1%.\n\nThe day's focus will be Nvidia earnings released after the U.S. market close. Nvidia's earnings release and outlook could determine equity sentiment for weeks to come as AI-related stocks have been a strong driver of returns.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks later on Wednesday, as does Bank of England rate-setter Swati Dhingra.\n\n\"An important highlight will be Nvidia's earnings after the U.S. close. Otherwise from central banks, we'll get the FOMC's minutes from the January meeting, and hear from the Fed's Bostic and the BoE's Dhingra,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.\n\nNvidia shares traded 1.6% lower in the premarket on Wednesday. Nasdaq futures fell 0.4%, while futures on the S&P 500 eased 0.24%.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese blue-chip stocks posted a 1.4% gain on the day, a day after the biggest reduction yet in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to support the property market.\n\n\"Regulators are cautious and taking a gradual approach, with the possibility of introducing further measures if needed,\" said Jian Shi Cortesi, Investment Director, Asia/China Growth Equities of GAM Investments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The market sentiment has improved slightly, but the sustainability relies more on improvements in economic activities and corporate earnings.\"\n\nDOLLAR BOOST\n\nThe dollar edged up against a basket of currencies, rising against the euro, the yen and sterling, which all lost around 0.1% on the day.\n\nThe minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent policy meeting will not capture the latest data on inflation, which has shown enough of an uptick to prompt investors to rethink when U.S. rates might start to fall.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expects the Fed to cut interest rates in June.\n\nMarkets expect 92 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to Fed's own projection of 75 bps of easing and sharply below the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has boosted the dollar and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-month lows.\n\nThe yen was at 150.07 per dollar, anchored around the key 150 level for the last few days, which is keeping traders on the watch for intervention from Japanese officials.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude was down 0.6% at $81.88 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 0.6% to trade at $76.57.\n\nIron ore futures declined for a third consecutive session on Wednesday to their lowest in nearly four months.\n\nThe most-traded May iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended daytime trade 3.98% lower at 893 yuan ($124.29) per metric ton, the lowest close since Oct. 31, after a more than 5% drop the day before.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Anisha Sircar in Bangalore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam, Ros Russell and Barbara Lewis)",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Help Set You Up for Life",
        "content": "A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) kicked off last year and has shown no signs of slowing. The nearly $200 billion industry is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That trajectory would see the market hit close to $2 trillion before the end of the decade.\n\nAI can potentially boost countless industries, from healthcare to consumer tech, education, e-commerce, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, and much more. With growth catalysts across multiple sectors, it could be one of the smartest moves to dedicate a portion of your portfolio to AI and profit from its long-term development.\n\nAs the world's first- and fourth-most valuable companies, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are two attractive options. These companies are heavily investing in AI and have secured powerful roles in the market, with one leading the software side of AI and the other dominating hardware. MSFT Chart\n\nMicrosoft and Nvidia stocks have already made more than a few millionaires, with their shares skyrocketing over the last decade (as seen in the chart above). While past growth doesn't always indicate what's to come, I wouldn't bet against these tech firms delivering significant gains thanks to AI long into the future.\n\nSo, here are two AI stocks that could set you up for life.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has become a Wall Street darling since the start of last year after snapping up an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training and running AI models.\n\nIncreased interest in AI has led to a spike in demand for GPUs. Meanwhile, Nvidia's years of dominance in the GPU market allowed it to get a head start in the segment while rivals like Advaned Micro Devices and Intel scrambled to catch up. These chipmakers have since unveiled competing AI GPUs, but will likely have difficulties overcoming Nvidia's lead. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOver the last year, Nvidia's quarterly revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have hit new heights as each has delivered triple-digit growth thanks to soaring chip sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's free cash flow hit more than $17 billion in 2023, significantly higher than AMD's just over $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion. Nvidia's running start in AI has given it the financial resources to continue investing in its business and retain its lead in AI.\n\nThe uses for artificial intelligence are rapidly expanding, suggesting GPU demand will continue rising for the foreseeable future.\n\nNvidia has an exciting long-term outlook as it continues developing in AI and supplies its chips to other areas of tech, such as video game consoles, PCs, and cloud platforms. Its price/earnings-to-growth ratio has dropped 85% in the last six months to an attractive 0.4, indicating it could be trading at a bargain compared to its growth potential.\n\nNvidia is a screaming buy for anyone looking to invest in AI and could deliver major gains for years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nIn January, Microsoft surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with its market cap currently at just over $3 trillion. The company is a tech behemoth with positions in multiple areas of the industry, leading in productivity software, game consoles, cloud computing, and operating systems.\n\nMeanwhile, heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI has led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry. The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup.\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft added new AI tools to its Azure cloud platform, integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its Bing search engine, and boosted productivity in its Office software suite with the help of AI.\n\nMoreover, the company is taking early steps to monetize its new offerings, launching an AI assistant called Copilot through its Microsoft 365 subscription service. The company describes the assistant as \"your everyday AI companion.\" Some of its generative capabilities include creating a first draft in Word, generating a full PowerPoint presentation based on a simple prompt, and producing data visualizations in seconds in Excel.\n\nCopilot has debuted as a $30 monthly add-on to a 365 membership, which could lead to significant earnings boosts for Microsoft.\n\nThe tech giant achieved more than $67 billion in free cash flow last year, highlighting the reliability of its business and its value as a long-term investment. The company's stock is slightly overvalued, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at about 35. However, its long history of growth, dominant role in tech, and expanding venture into AI means it is likely worth its high valuation.\n\nThe company is profiting from tailwinds across tech and has excellent prospects in AI, suggesting a long-term investment in Microsoft's stock could set you up for life.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia will release its results today. (Sipa US, Sipa US)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia is set to release its latest financial results after Wall Street closes today, and stakes are high thanks to its share price more than tripling last year amid AI enthusiasm.\n\nThe chip maker, which dominates the market for data center AI chips, is expected to announce sales revenues of around $20bn (£15.86bn) in the fourth quarter and earnings per share of $4.60. This compares to just around $6bn in sales a year ago, and EPS of just 88 cents.\n\nA miss in earnings or lower forward guidance is likely to cause a wave of profit taking in the technology sector and also drag the broader market. But a stronger than expected report could add to the upward momentum and draw in more investors who are already experiencing some degree of FOMO.\n\nNeil Wilson, chief market analyst for Finalto, said: \"Signs of tension were evident yesterday as NVDA dropped more than 4% and dragged the rest of the market south.\n\n\"At 30x earnings there is little room above and the market is a tad worried about a 50% YTD gain unravelling on earnings – profit taking I guess you would call it. I still think there is a material chance that 2025 estimates are revised higher though.\"\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nHSBC fell out of favour with investors on Wednesday despite it revealing a near 80% jump in pre-tax profits which rose to $30.35bn (£24bn) in 2023, driven by high interest rates.\n\nShares slumped more than 7% as Europe's largest bank missed forecasts due to a $3bn (£2.3bn) impairment from its stake in a Chinese bank, the Bank of Communications.\n\nThe bank’s 2023 pre-tax profit jumped 78% to $30.35bn, while net profit rose 56% to $22.43bn. The steep rise in full-year earnings prompted the bank to announce fresh share buybacks of up to $2bn.\n\nThe London-headquartered bank also announced a fourth interim dividend of $0.31 per share, resulting in a total for 2023 of $0.61 per share.\n\n“Our record profit performance in 2023 enabled us to reward our shareholders with our highest full-year dividend since 2008, three share buy-backs last year totalling $7bn, and a further share buy-back of up to” $2bn, group chief executive Noel Quinn said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to three share buybacks totalling $7bn, Quinn said the bank returned $19bn to shareholders last year.\n\nRead more: HSBC full-year profits surge fuelled by high interest rates\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nGlencore slipped into the red in London as the miner revealed that lower commodity prices halved its earnings last year.\n\nShares dropped to their lowest level in a year after underlying profits fell 50% to $17.1bn (£13.5bn), although it was still one of the company’s best ever performances.\n\nIt saw profits surge in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as an energy crisis hit Europe.\n\nGlencore lowered its dividend to $1.6bn and for the first time in several years did not announced a new share buyback program.\n\nIt also slashed its dividend to investors, as it aims to fund the acquisition of a 77% stake in Teck Resources’ metallurgical coal business.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks head lower as UK posts largest January budget surplus\n\n“Although the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, global economic growth is forecast to bottom out in 2024,” chief executive officer Gary Nagle said.\n\n“Expected interest rate cuts and corresponding restocking along the supply chain are likely to bring an improvement in demand conditions in western markets later in the year.”\n\nThe company also recorded $2.5bn of writedowns at year-end, including $762m on its Mutanda copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nBAE Systems (BA.L)\n\nBAE Systems has predicted slower earnings growth in 2024 after a 14% jump last year, when the defence company's order backlog swelled to a record level. This was driven by new submarine contracts and demand amid the Ukraine war.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share for the current year are expected to rise 6% to 8% compared to the better-than-expected 14% increase to 63.2 pence it reported for 2023.\n\nThe British weapons maker added that it won contracts worth £38bn last year, including deals related to the next generation of the UK’s nuclear deterrent submarines, the Aukus defence pact and combat vehicles being bought by central and eastern European countries.\n\nCharles Woodburn, chief executive, said: \"While most of our order volume was driven by existing programme positions that pre-date the Ukraine conflict, orders to restock and upgrade heavy armour and munitions are starting to come through,\"\n\nBAE is forecasting sales growth of 10-12% this year, above the 9% recorded last year, and increased its annual dividend by 11%.\n\nHowever, shares tumbled as much as 3% on the day.\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - A \"responsible\" AI image generation startup backed by stock photo provider Getty Images has raised $24 million in a Series A funding round, including from top ad agency Publicis Groupe, it said on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael-based BRIA, which licenses more than a billion images from stock providers for its system, said in a press release that it would use the cash infusion to expand globally and build out text-to-video generation capabilities.\n\nThe investment, while small relative to others in the white hot AI space, makes BRIA an early test case in how licensing deals can provide a path forward in disputes raging over the use of copyrighted content to train generative AI models.\n\nMusic labels, artists and other content owners have pointed to licensing as a more palatable approach to generative AI, after big AI companies built their systems using content scraped off the open internet for free.\n\nBRIA said its license-only approach heads off the risk of trademarks and other fraught elements appearing in its generated images, attracting customers in the advertising, marketing and media world including Publicis.\n\n\"There is a way to do this that is both responsible and commercial,\" CEO Yair Adato told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGetty, which has backed BRIA since 2022, has figured prominently in the disputes around training data.\n\nLast year, Getty sued leading AI image generation company Stability AI for using its photos without a license, which it alleged was \"brazen\" infringement of its intellectual property \"on a staggering scale.\"\n\nIt also teamed up with chip maker Nvidia last year to build an image generation service trained only on the images in its own library.\n\nRivals Adobe and Shutterstock likewise offer AI image generators, while all three photo companies license their visuals to Nvidia for its own service.\n\nBRIA fed its model visuals from 18 stock providers, including Getty, Alamy, SuperStock and Envato. It charges customers for access to the platform and shares revenue with the photo companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nEach time BRIA generates an image, it displays the original licensed images that contributed data toward that output and accounts for how much came from each.\n\nAdato likens the approach to a Spotify model for the AI era, which compensates content owners for their role in enabling the technology.\n\nControlled training also guards against the technology being used to create misleading visuals that could tarnish brands or influence elections, he said.\n\nBRIA's model, for instance, is not capable of generating an image of U.S. President Joe Biden because it has never been taught what he looks like, said Adato.

Investors will also watch out for comments from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman on Wednesday.\n\nA majority of traders are currently pricing in June as the starting point for rate easing, compared with March at the start of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 5:16 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 72 points, or 0.19%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 10.5 points, or 0.21%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 70.75 points, or 0.4%.\n\nAdding to the declines, Palo Alto Networks slumped 22.7% after the cybersecurity firm forecast third-quarter billings below Wall Street estimates, signaling cautious spending by businesses.\n\nShares of other cybersecurity companies such as Fortinet , Zscaler and Crowdstrike Holdings fell between 5.7% and 9.2%.\n\nAmazon.com gained 1.1%, with the company set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective next week, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance. Shares of Walgreens slipped 3.0%.\n\nRenewable energy firm SolarEdge Technologies dropped 15.6% after it projected first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Invested in These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Here's the Best of the Bunch.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announces its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results this week. It's likely to report full-year revenue in the ballpark of $60 billion. Roughly 45% of whatever revenue the chipmaker generates will roll to the bottom line.\n\nWe now know more details about how Nvidia is putting some of its huge profits to work. The company revealed last week that it has invested in five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here they are -- and I'll highlight which is the best of the bunch.\n\n1. Arm Holdings\n\nBack in 2020, Nvidia announced plans to acquire what is now Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) for $40 billion. That deal ultimately fell apart because of regulatory challenges. However, Nvidia now owns a small stake in Arm following a purchase of around 1.96 million shares that are currently worth over $250 million.\n\nArm's CPUs are used in over 99% of the world's smartphones. CEO Rene Haas said in Arm's fiscal 2024 third-quarter conference call earlier this month that the company is \"seeing strong momentum and tailwinds from all things AI.\" He specifically mentioned that Arm's technology is being used in Nvidia's Grace Hopper 200 AI superchip and Alphabet's Google Gemini Nano Pixel 6.\n\n2. Nano-X Imaging\n\nNvidia merely nibbled with its new position in Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX). The huge chipmaker purchased 59,632 shares that are currently valued at more than $770,000. That amounts to pocket change for Nvidia.\n\nWhat does Nvidia like about Nano-X? The company developed a digital X-ray machine that can dramatically cut the costs of medical imaging. It's also using AI to help diagnose patients, receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for technology that identifies patients at risk of coronary artery disease.\n\n3. Recursion Pharmaceuticals\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX) ranks as Nvidia's second-biggest recent AI investment, trailing behind only Arm Holdings. Nvidia bought over 7.7 million shares of Recursion worth close to $230 million today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's been a lot of buzz in recent years about the use of AI in speeding up drug development. Recursion's technology has also demonstrated how much AI can help. The biotechnology company's pipeline features five programs in clinical testing. Its big pharma partners include Bayer and Roche.\n\n4. Soundhound AI\n\nFor a company with AI in its name, Soundhound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) has performed dismally over the past 12 months. However, Nvidia's small investment in the company (roughly 1.73 million shares now worth around $6.6 million) provided a big boost.\n\nSoundhound AI is a leader in voice AI. Its technology powers AI systems used in vehicles made by major carmakers including Honda, Kia, and Stellantis (which markets Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Maserati, and more). Soundhound is also a major player in the restaurant technology market, with customers including Krispy Kreme and White Castle.\n\n5. TuSimple Holdings\n\nNvidia also recently bought nearly 3.47 million shares of TuSimple Holdings, a stake now valued at over $13 million. TuSimple is the smallest company in which Nvidia has invested, with a market cap of a little over $130 million. It's also the only Chinese company in the group.\n\nTuSimple develops autonomous semi trucks. Its self-driving trucks have logged around 10 million miles to date. The company is especially targeting China and Japan, both of which have encouraging regulatory environments for autonomous trucks.\n\nBest of the bunch\n\nWe can use a process of logical elimination to pick the best of these Nvidia investments. TuSimple can be quickly removed from contention. Last month, the company announced its plans to delist its stock from the Nasdaq stock exchange and become privately held, a move it completed in mid-February.\n\nNano-X, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and Soundhound AI remain unprofitable. All three companies could have great potential over the long run, but I think their financial positions are problematic.\n\nThat leaves Arm Holdings as the best of the bunch. The company's business continues to deliver solid growth. AI will almost certainly provide a major tailwind for Arm for years to come. While Arm beats out the other four recent Nvidia investments, though, its valuation is concerning. Shares now trade at a forward earnings multiple of over 81.\n\nMy view is that investors looking for a great AI stock to buy will be better off going with Nvidia itself rather than Arm, Nano-X, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, or Soundhound. It has strong growth prospects. It's highly profitable. And while its valuation could seem pricey, Nvidia stock is still much cheaper than Arm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Billionaires Sold Way Too Early",
        "content": "In case you missed it, last week marked one of the most important data releases of the year. Wednesday, Feb. 14, was the last day for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA 13F provides investors with a detailed snapshot of what Wall Street's top money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter (in this case, the December-ended quarter). Despite being up to 45 days old when filed, 13Fs can still offer clear clues as to what stocks, industries, and trends are garnering the attention of asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFor more than a year, no trend has been captivating the attention of investors and professional money managers quite like artificial intelligence (AI). Broadly speaking, AI involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks typically given to humans. With the incorporation of machine learning, these software and systems are able to learn and evolve over time, thereby becoming more effective at their tasks.\n\nWhat's made AI such a thrilling investment thesis is that virtually all sectors and industries can benefit from the technology. Based on a May 2023 report from PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to worldwide gross domestic product by 2030.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's smartest, most successful money managers thrived by holding stakes in AI stocks throughout most of 2023, the latest round of 13Fs shows that a number of billionaires sold their stakes in a few high-flying AI stocks way too soon.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that's made billionaire money managers regret their decision to sell is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). During the fourth quarter, eight prominent billionaires lightened their fund's stakes, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough the closing bell on Feb. 16, Nvidia has gained nearly 47%, or almost $231 per share, on a year-to-date basis. This means Englander's fund has left at least $390 million on the table this year, if not more, depending on when Millennium Management exited its close to 1.69 million shares.\n\nThe two factors that have powered Nvidia higher are its innovation and pricing power. With regard to the former, the company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have demonstrated incredible speed and efficiency in AI-accelerated data centers. Many of the largest AI players, which include Microsoft and Meta Platforms, have placed big orders for Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThe second factor -- Nvidia's exceptional pricing power -- is the result of its GPUs being in high demand. When the demand for a product is high but supply is constrained, the price of said product will increase until demand levels out. The fact that Nvidia's cost of revenue moved only modestly higher through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended in January 2024) while companywide sales jumped by 86% demonstrates that Nvidia's pricing power is doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWhat'll be interesting in 2024 is whether Nvidia can sustain its stellar results. An increase in GPU production threatens to cannibalize its own pricing power. Meanwhile, external and internal competitors are gathering at the proverbial gate to challenge Nvidia.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nA second AI stock that likely has billionaires kicking themselves because they sold way too soon is server and storage company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). During the December-ended quarter, four prominent billionaires sold shares, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (255,383 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (144,833 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (93,827 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (72,237 shares)\n\nIn less than seven weeks since the year began, Super Micro's shares have catapulted higher by 183%, or about $519 per share. They're also up by a jaw-dropping 878% since the start of 2023. For Steven Cohen's Point72, it means leaving more than $132 million on the table in under two months.\n\nWhat's made Super Micro such a hot commodity for AI investors is the customizable rack-scale servers it's supplying to businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro's rack-scale servers use Nvidia's top-notch GPUs, it's somewhat linked Super Micro's success to that of Nvidia. When one moves higher, so has the other.\n\nAlthough Cohen, Griffin, Englander, and Yass may be sore that they missed out on some historic gains to begin 2024, their exit may ultimately prove prudent. Historically speaking, every next-big-thing trend for the past three decades has endured an early-stage bubble. In fact, Super Micro fizzled out years earlier when growth expectations for the company during the cloud boom failed to materialize. If history is right, AI demand won't come anywhere close to matching investors' otherworldly expectations for the technology -- at least in the early going.\n\nThe other problem for Super Micro Computer is that it's entirely dependent on its suppliers, which includes Nvidia. As long as the supply of Nvidia's high-powered GPUs remains constrained, it'll be difficult for Super Micro to max out its own demand. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArm Holdings\n\nThe third AI stock billionaires sold way too early, based on the latest round of 13F filings, is semiconductor microprocessor intellectual property giant Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), which went public in mid-September. During the fourth quarter, six billionaire money managers parted ways with their respective fund's shares, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,086,848 shares) Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management (980,392 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (600,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (318,189 shares) Israel Englander of Millennial Management (51,007 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (14,843 shares)\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, shares of ARM have galloped higher by roughly 71%, or a little more than $53 per share, as of the closing bell on Feb. 16. This means Ken Griffin and his team have missed out on $111 million in respective gains since the year began.\n\nArm Holdings generates all of its revenue from royalties and licensing. It designs central processing units (CPUs), and major chip companies pay Arm for the right to use its designs. It's a fantastic gig that generates incredibly high margins. A number of major AI players, including Nvidia (which has invested directly in Arm) and Microsoft, are utilizing Arm designs in their processing chips designed for AI servers.\n\nWhile Arm's blowout fiscal third-quarter operating results (ended Dec. 31) dazzled Wall Street, these six billionaires may not be hurting for long. That's because Arm's valuation could be a tough pill to swallow for investors.\n\nAlthough the company's profit forecast received a nice boost and its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) blew past consensus expectations, Arm's generally accepted accounted principles (GAAP) profit, which gives you the numbers that really matter, showed a 52% drop in net income to $87 million. Even on an adjusted basis, Arm is trading at 105 times the midpoint of its EPS forecast for fiscal 2024 and more than 41 times the midpoint of its sales forecast.\n\nDespite its juiced-up margins, Arm stock has all the hallmarks of being in an unsustainable bubble.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Updates throughout, refreshes prices at 0945 GMT)\n\nBy Amanda Cooper\n\nLONDON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global shares eased on Wednesday ahead of earnings from Nvidia, which many are hoping will help justify the hype around 2024's AI-driven rally, and ahead of minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting.\n\nIn commodities, steps by Chinese authorities to prop up economic growth in the world's largest raw materials consumer has raised fresh concerns about the growth outlook, which weighed on crude oil and iron ore.\n\nStocks in Europe traded down on the day, as shares in HSBC fell 5% after the region's largest bank reported a record annual profit that missed analyst expectations.\n\nThe STOXX 600 was down 0.3%, but within a whisker of record highs. The MSCI All-World index fell 0.1% on the day.\n\nThe key event of the day will be Nvidia earnings released after the US market close. Nvidia's earnings release and outlook are key for equity sentiment in the weeks to come as AI related stocks have been a strong driver of returns.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks later on, as does Bank of England rate-setter Swati Dhingra.\n\n\"An important highlight will be Nvidia's earnings after the US close. Otherwise from central banks, we'll get the FOMC's minutes from the January meeting, and hear from the Fed's Bostic and the BoE's Dhingra,\" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.\n\nNvidia shares traded 1.6% lower in the premarket on Wednesday. Nasdaq futures fell 0.4%, while futures on the S&P 500 eased 0.24%.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese blue-chip stocks posted a 1.8% gain on the day, a day after the biggest ever reduction in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to prop up the struggling property market.\n\n\"Regulators are cautious and taking a gradual approach, with the possibility of introducing further measures if needed,\" said Jian Shi Cortesi, Investment Director, Asia/China Growth Equities of GAM Investments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The market sentiment has improved slightly, but the sustainability relies more on improvements in economic activities and corporate earnings.\"\n\nDOLLAR BOOST\n\nThe dollar edged up against a basket of currencies, forging higher against the euro, the yen and sterling, which all lost between 0.1 and 0.2% on the day.\n\nThe minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent policy meeting will not capture the most recent data on inflation, which has shown enough of an uptick to prompt investors to rethink when U.S. rates might start to fall.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expects the Fed to cut interest rates in June.\n\nMarkets now expect 92 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to Fed's own projection of 75 bps of easing and sharply below the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has boosted the dollar this year and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-month lows.\n\nThe yen was at 150.065 per dollar, anchored to the key 150 level for the past few days, which is keeping traders on the watch for intervention from Japanese officials.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude was down 0.6% at $81.86 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 0.6% to trade at $76.57.\n\nIron ore futures declined for a third consecutive session on Wednesday to their lowest in nearly four months.\n\nThe most-traded May iron ore on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ended daytime trade 3.98% lower at 893 yuan ($124.29) per metric ton, the lowest close since Oct. 31, after a more than 5% drop the day before.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Anisha Sircar in Bangalore; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Ros Russell)",

        "content": "(Updated at 0602 GMT)\n\nBy Ankur Banerjee\n\nSINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Chinese markets lifted Asian stocks on Wednesday on optimism over steps taken by policymakers to boost confidence, while looming earnings from Nvidia kept investors on edge following the recent frenzied AI-driven global rally.\n\nFinancial markets will also look out for the minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting in January for further clues on the policy outlook as expectations of early U.S. interest rate cuts dissipate in the wake of sticky inflation data.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.62% on Wednesday, touching their highest in seven weeks, with stocks in China and Hong Kong providing the biggest boost.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI300 index rallied 1.8%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 3%, a day after the biggest ever reduction in the nation's benchmark mortgage rate as authorities stepped up efforts to prop up the struggling property market.\n\n\"Regulators are cautious and taking a gradual approach, with the possibility of introducing further measures if needed,\" said Jian Shi Cortesi, Investment Director, Asia/China Growth Equities of GAM Investments.\n\n\"The market sentiment has improved slightly, but the sustainability relies more on improvements in economic activities and corporate earnings.\"\n\nChina's stock exchanges on Tuesday said major quant fund Lingjun Investment had broken rules on orderly trading and barred it from buying and selling for three days, as part of wider regulatory measures to revive market confidence.\n\nOver in Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei closed down 0.26%, having stuttered in the last few days within sight of the all-time high set in 1989, as nervousness ahead of Nvidia earnings grip investors.\n\nNvidia stumbled on Tuesday, dropping 4% and pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq nearly 1% lower. Nasdaq futures were 0.26% lower, while futures for the S&P 500 eased 0.14%.\n\nEuropean bourses are set for a subdued start, with Eurostoxx 50 futures up 0.02%, German DAX futures down 0.04% and FTSE futures 0.14% lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nEurope's benchmark stock index remains near its highest in two years and is eyeing the record high touched in January 2022.\n\nFED MINUTES\n\nOn the monetary policy front, traders will get a chance to assess minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting later in the day for any further clues on when the U.S. central bank will start its easing cycle.\n\nData last week showed sticky U.S. inflation, prompting investors to push back expectations of an early start to the rate-cut cycle. Markets are now pricing in June as the starting point for easing, compared with March at the start of the year.\n\nA slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expects the Fed to cut interest rates in June.\n\nMarkets now expect 92 basis points of cuts from the Fed this year, closer to Fed's own projection of 75 bps of easing and sharply below the 150 bps of cuts priced in by traders at the start of the year.\n\nThe changing rates outlook has buoyed the dollar this year and kept the yen, which is extremely sensitive to U.S. rates, near three-months low.\n\nThe yen was at 149.95 per dollar, anchored to the key 150 level for the past few days, keeping traders on the watch for intervention from Japanese officials.\n\nJapan's exports rose more than expected in January, helping ease some concerns about demand and output after data last week showed the economy unexpectedly tipped into recession in the fourth quarter.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar index eased 0.067% to 103.97, inching away from the three-month high of 104.97 it touched last week.\n\nIn commodities, U.S. crude rose 0.43% to $77.37 per barrel and Brent was at $82.72, up 0.46% on the day.\n\nIron ore futures were rooted to their lowest level in over three months, weighed down by mounting concerns over the demand outlook in top consumer China.\n\nSpot gold added 0.4% to $2,031.55 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Additional reporting by Anisha Sircar; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",

        "title": "Nikkei rally stalls on market jitters before Nvidia earnings",
        "content": "(Updated with closing levels)\n\nBy Brigid Riley\n\nTOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Japan's benchmark stock index finished lower for a second day on Wednesday, teetering below an all-time high as traders waited to see if the financial results of U.S. chipmaker Nvidia justify the AI euphoria that has gripped global share markets recently.\n\nThe Nikkei share average regained some of its morning losses but still closed down 0.26% at 38262.16, with 124 of its 225 constituents declining.\n\nOver the past week or so, the benchmark gauge has been edging closer to the lifetime record of 38,957.44 set on the final trading day of 1989 at the peak of Japan's bubble economy. On Friday, the benchmark index pushed as high as 38,865.06 before pulling back into the close. It is currently just under 700 points shy of the record high.\n\nThe broader Topix finished the day down 0.19% at 2627.3.\n\nThe Nikkei's momentum towards the 35-year record has been stalled by Wall Street, which closed lower overnight after returning from a holiday on Monday, as investors worried whether Nvidia's quarterly results will justify its expensive valuation. The broader Philadelphia semiconductor index declined over 1% as Nvidia and other chip stocks stumbled.\n\nNikkei's tech-related shares sagged, with chip-testing equipment maker Advantest, which counts Nvidia among its customers, down about 2%. Chip-making equipment giant Tokyo Electron fell 0.38%, and Lasertec Corp, another company involved in producing chip-related equipment, lost 1.89%.\n\nSoftBank Group, which invests in an AI-focused startup, was down roughly 2%.\n\nJapan's chip giants, which share ties with high tech companies in the U.S., have had a \"significant impact\" on the Nikkei, said Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management's Chief Market Strategist Masahiro Ichikawa, putting plenty of weight on Nvidia's revenue report.\n\nIf the tech company's results disappoint, Ichikawa sees potential for the Nikkei to fall below 38,000 points, while a surprise to the upside could be enough to push the index to all-time highs.

        "title": "SOXX: This Powerhouse Semiconductor ETF Has More Upside Ahead",
        "content": "The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is up a scorching 56.8% over the past year, but this powerhouse ETF could have plenty of additional upside ahead.\n\nI’m bullish on SOXX based on its strong portfolio of highly-rated semiconductor stocks, the long-term growth prospects of the semiconductor industry, its market-beating performance over the long term, and the fact that many of its components are less expensive than one might expect, given their strong performances.\n\nWhat Is the SOXX ETF’s Strategy?\n\nSOXX is an index ETF from BlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) iShares that, according to BlackRock, gives investors “exposure to U.S. companies that design, manufacture, and distribute semiconductors.”\n\nIs It Too Late to Invest in Semiconductors?\n\nWith SOXX’s impressive gain over the past year and the momentum that semiconductor stocks have had in general, many investors may wonder if they are too late to invest in the semiconductor sector. The good news is that while the space has run up quite a bit, the entire industry has plenty of runway for growth ahead. Analysts from McKinsey believe the market could grow by 80% over the course of this decade and reach $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nWhile the growth of generative AI is arguably the most exciting field driving this growth, it’s important to remember that other promising areas like self-driving cars, high-performance computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will drive further demand for semiconductors as well.\n\nSOXX’s Holdings\n\nAs a directional bet on U.S. semiconductor stocks, SOXX isn’t particularly diversified, and that’s alright. It holds 30 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.1% of its portfolio. Below is an overview of SOXX’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nSOXX has large positions in its top holdings like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as these stocks are up 239.7%, 121.5%, and 113.9%, respectively, over the past year, helping drive SOXX’s red-hot performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s interesting to note that while these are large positions, SOXX’s exposure to Nvidia is actually quite a bit lower than that of its largest competitor in the semiconductor ETF space, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), which features a massive 24.7% position in the AI chip leader. This isn’t necessarily a good thing or a bad thing, but it does take some risk off the table for SOXX compared to SMH in the event that Nvidia’s stock pulls back.\n\nBeyond these leaders in generative AI chips, I like the fact that SOXX includes stocks from all facets of the semiconductor value chain, including semiconductor fabricators and the companies that make the complex equipment and machinery used in the semiconductor manufacturing process, such as Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).\n\nI like this for a few reasons. First, it adds to SOXX’s diversification by bringing in different parts of the semiconductor supply chain to its portfolio.\n\nSecond, these are great stocks that have generated outstanding returns for shareholders over the past year. Applied Materials is up 74.5% over the past year, Lam Research is up 89.1%, ASML is up 43.6%, and Taiwan Semiconductor is up 42.8%.\n\nFurthermore, while these stocks have surged, they aren’t egregiously priced and offer better value than one might expect at first glance. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at 20.2 times consensus 2024 earnings estimates, while Applied Materials trades at 24.5 2024 earnings estimates. While these numbers aren’t cheap, they are roughly in line with the broader market, which is pretty attractive for stocks performing this well.\n\nLam Research and ASML are a bit more expensive, with Lam Research trading at 31.2 times 2024 earnings estimates and ASML trading at 45.6 times estimates.\n\nLastly, these stocks are collectively viewed very favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor feature ‘Perfect 10’ Smart Scores, Applied Materials features an Outperform-equivalent Smart Score of 9, and Lam Research has a Neutral-equivalent Smart Score of 7.\n\nLooking at the rest of SOXX’s portfolio, an impressive nine of its top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or higher. Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), and the aforementioned ASML all feature 10 out of 10 Smart Scores.\n\nThe Smart Score system also takes a favorable view of SOXX itself, giving it an outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nScintillating Long-Term Performance\n\nTo put it simply, SOXX’s long-term performance has blown the doors off of the broader market, and it’s not even particularly close. As of January 31, SOXX posted outstanding annualized returns of 16.0% over the past three years, 31.1% over the past five, and 24.5% over the past 10.\n\nFor comparison, as of January 31, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) returned 11.0% over the past three years, 14.2% over the past five years, and 12.6% over the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-centric Nasdaq (NDX), as represented by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), has returned 20.7% over the past five years and 18.1% over the past 10.\n\nTo be clear, it hasn’t always been a smooth ride, as SOXX has experienced plenty of volatility along the way, but the long-term trend is clearly “up and to the right.” For example, SOXX lost 35.1% of its value in 2022 but followed this up by bouncing back with a 67.1% return in 2023.\n\nWhat Is SOXX’s Expense Ratio?\n\nSOXX’s expense ratio of 0.35% means that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually. This is the same expense ratio that other popular ETFs like the aforementioned SMH and the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:XSD) charge, which is probably not coincidental as these funds are all competitors.\n\nIs SOXX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SOXX earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SOXX stock price target of $666.76 implies 8.5% upside potential.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nIn conclusion, I’m bullish on SOXX based on its market-beating performance over the past decade, its portfolio of highly-rated stocks from across the semiconductor value chain, and the long-term growth prospects of the semiconductor industry. While the ETF has been on a tear, it’s not too late to consider investing in SOXX, and there is room for more upside ahead, as its holdings have strong growth prospects, and many are less expensive than one would expect.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds pared exposure to the Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks in the fourth quarter amid signs of extremes in the market, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Stocks Fall Before Nvidia’s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\n“Funds were net sellers of most of the Magnificent Seven stocks,” as their weights rose to records, strategists including Ben Snider and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday that analyzed 722 hedge funds with $2.6 trillion of gross equity positions. All seven except Amazon Inc. saw a decrease in exposure, they added.\n\nThe changes underscore how investors are increasingly questioning whether the group — comprised of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — can repeat last year’s performance, when an index of the stocks rose 106% versus the S&P 500’s 24% gain. Some strategists have started noting a wide dispersion of consensus growth estimates across the group.\n\nThe group’s earnings-reporting season has been mixed. While Meta and Amazon beat expectations, Apple and Tesla saw some weakness. Nvidia’s earnings are due later Wednesday, and traders will be looking for confirmation the company can meet the lofty expectations set amid the artificial-intelligence boom. Option trades are implying an 11% earnings move in the stock, which has tripled in price in the past year.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple and Nvidia “ranked among the Info Tech stocks with the largest net decreases in hedge fund popularity, while communication services stocks like Snap Inc. were added, the Goldman team wrote.\n\n“While trimming mega-cap tech stocks, hedge funds looked for opportunities in cyclicals and some pockets of growth,” the Goldman team wrote. Funds continued to rotate toward cyclicals over defensives, lifting that preference to the highest since 2016 amid strong US economic data and hints of improvement in global manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe large degrees of hedge fund crowding, momentum exposure and gross leverage have all aided returns during the past year, but they also point to “the risk of a violent unwind if the market environment shifts,” as briefly occurred during the last several weeks of 2023, Goldman analysts added.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Nikkei slumps on market jitters before Nvidia earnings",
        "content": "By Brigid Riley\n\nTOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Japan's benchmark stock index edged down for a second day on Wednesday, teetering below an all-time high as traders waited to see if the financial results of U.S. chipmaker Nvidia justify the AI euphoria that has gripped global share markets recently.\n\nThe Nikkei share average was down 0.46% at 38188.85 by the midday close, with 147 of its 225 constituents declining.\n\nOver the past week or so, the benchmark gauge has been edging closer to the lifetime record of 38,957.44 set on the final trading day of 1989 at the peak of Japan's bubble economy. On Friday, the benchmark index pushed as high as 38,865.06 before pulling back into the close.\n\nThe broader Topix was down 0.45% at 2620.45.\n\nTraders moved cautiously ahead of the financial results, which are due later on Wednesday and could test the AI frenzy that's gripped both U.S. and Japanese markets.\n\nThe Nikkei's momentum towards the 35-year record has been stalled by Wall Street, which closed lower overnight after returning from a holiday on Monday, as investors worried whether Nvidia's quarterly results will justify its expensive valuation. The broader Philadelphia semiconductor index declined over 1% as Nvidia and other chip stocks stumbled.\n\nNikkei's tech-related shares sagged, with chip-testing equipment maker Advantest, which counts Nvidia among its customers, down 3.17%. Chip-making equipment giant Tokyo Electron fell 1.3%.\n\nSoftBank Group, which invests in an AI-focused startup, was down about 2% by the midday break.\n\nJapan's chip giants, which share ties with high tech companies in the U.S., have had a \"significant impact\" on the Nikkei, said Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management's Chief Market Strategist Masahiro Ichikawa, putting plenty of weight on Nvidia's revenue report.\n\nIf the tech company's results disappoint, Ichikawa sees potential for the Nikkei to fall below 38,000 points, while a surprise to the upside could be enough to push the index to all-time highs.

        "title": "Asia Stocks Drop With Focus on Nvidia, China Moves: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Asian stocks fell after a tech-led retreat on Wall Street, with all eyes on Nvidia Corp.’s earnings due later Wednesday and the impact of China’s latest market support measures.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Stocks Fall Before Nvidia’s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nShares dropped from Japan to South Korea and Australia, with Hong Kong equity futures declining as well. The region’s weak tone came after the Nasdaq 100 fell almost 1% and the S&P 500 slid below 5,000. Nvidia sank more than 4% in the run-up to its results later Wednesday, where traders will be looking for confirmation the chipmaker can meet the lofty expectations set by the artificial-intelligence boom.\n\nThe focus is also on Chinese stocks after the country’s two main bourses froze the accounts of a major quantitative hedge fund for three days after the money manager dumped a large amount of shares within a minute Monday. Meantime, banks also ramped up funding help for the troubled property sector.\n\n“The company’s results have become the biggest of the reporting period, acting as both a macroeconomic barometer and the proverbial canary in the coal mine for the artificial intelligence boom,” said Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.Com Inc., referring to Nvidia. “The bar for an upside surprise is set high,” with its valuation at eye-watering levels, he said.\n\nThe dollar steadied and Treasury 10-year yields were little changed in Asian trading, while persistent bearishness around the outlook for China’s steel demand pushed iron ore to a three-month low.\n\nIn Japan, recent loss of momentum has pulled the Nikkei 225 further away from reaching its highest-ever close of 38,915.87 in 1989. Still, macro and stock hedge funds are betting on Japan this year, predicting the central bank will shift its policy after eight years of negative interest rates. The yen steadied slightly below 150 per dollar as the nation’s exports rose more than expected in January.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Nerves\n\nThe ongoing earnings season has so far reaffirmed the view that Corporate America is holding up well, although the reporting period has been mixed for the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps. Among other highlights from the US session, Walmart Inc. climbed after reporting strong earnings while Palo Alto Networks Inc. tumbled in late trading after cutting its revenue forecast for the year.\n\nAhead of Nvidia’s numbers, some traders decided to lock in profits — with the market also weighing a report that Microsoft Corp. is developing a networking card as an alternative to the one supplied by the chipmaker.\n\nThe artificial-intelligence frenzy has boosted stocks that have been linked to the technology, and Nvidia is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.\n\nThe Fed’s January meeting minutes are also due on Wednesday, offering traders more clues about where policymakers stand on a rate-cut timeline. Faster-than-expected inflation last week fueled concerns the Fed may not begin cutting interest rates as soon — or by as much — as market participants previously expected this year.\n\nIn commodities, oil steadied as investors juggled signs of tighter supplies with elevated tensions in the Middle East and a still-shaky demand outlook. Elsewhere, gold was little changed after four sessions of gains.\n\nKey Events This Week:\n\nEurozone consumer confidence, Wednesday Nvidia, HSBC earnings, Wednesday Federal Reserve releases minutes from its January meeting, Wednesday Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, Wednesday Eurozone S&P Global Services PMI, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, CPI, Thursday US initial jobless claims, US existing home sales, Thursday ECB issues account of January meeting, Thursday Fed Governor Lisa Cook and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak, Thursday China property prices, Friday Germany IFO business climate, GDP, Friday ECB publishes 1- and 3-Year inflation expectations survey, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.2% as of 10:13 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.4% Nikkei 225 futures (OSE) fell 0.5% Japan’s Topix fell 0.2% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.7% Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 0.1% Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0807 The Japanese yen was little changed at 150.05 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2050 per dollar The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6551\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin rose 0.5% to $52,275.21 Ether rose 0.5% to $3,003.76\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 4.29% Japan’s 10-year yield was unchanged at 0.725% Australia’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.19%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.1% to $77.12 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n—With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "This is a big week for earnings. Not only is AI-leader NVIDIA Corp. reporting, but many other companies, whose stock charts are also breaking out, are going to be reporting as well. These red-hot companies are a more extensive list than you might expect, including companies in home building, finance, travel and even the old economy.\n\nIt’s not all about NVIDIA although it’s chart is amazing. Tracey takes a look at 4 other companies that have also seen big gains over the last year, with several breaking out to new all-time highs. And none of these companies are even in AI. This 2024 rally has been broader than most have believed.\n\nIt’s not easy to beat every quarter, or nearly every quarter, over the course of multiple years. Yet several of these companies have done that. They are earnings all-stars.\n\nWill these companies beat again and will the stocks surge to new highs?\n\n5 Phenomenal Earnings Charts\n\n1.    NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA has beat 4 quarters in a row. Shares are up 239% over the last year. But earnings are expected to rise 269.5% in fiscal 2024 and 64% in fiscal 2025.\n\nNVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of just 36.\n\nIs NVIDIA a bellwether stock now?\n\n2. Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR)\n\nBuilders FirstSource has not missed on earnings in 5 years. That’s impressive given the COVID pandemic which hit 4 years ago. Earnings are expected to fall 26% in 2023 as building and home remodeling slowed. And analysts expect earnings to decline another 6% in 2024.\n\nShares of Builders FirstSource have surged 125% to new all-time highs over the last year. It’s still cheap. Builders FirstSource trades with a forward P/E of just 14.\n\nShould Builders FirstSource be on your short list?\n\n3.    Intuit Inc. (INTU)\n\nIntuit has only missed one time in the last 5 years and it was in 2022. That’s an impressive track record. Shares of Intuit are up 62% over the last year.\n\nIntuit isn’t a cheap stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 40.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Intuit priced for perfection?\n\n4. Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG)\n\nBooking has beat 12 quarters in a row with its last miss in 2020, when the COVID pandemic began. Booking’s earnings are expected to rise 49% in 2023 and another 19.6% in 2024.\n\nShares of Booking are up 51% in the last year and have broken out to new all-time highs. Booking Holdings trades with a forward P/E of just 21.\n\nWill Booking Holdings beat again this quarter?\n\n5. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway usually doesn’t make the earnings all-stars videos. It is lightly covered by analysts on Zacks.com. Zacks has just 2 estimates for the full year. But Berkshire Hathaway has beat 2 out of the last 4 quarters.\n\nShares are red-hot, up 32% in the last year. Berkshire Hathaway has been hitting new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nIs Berkshire Hathway too hot to handle?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of BKNG in her personal portfolio, and BLDR and BRK.B in the Insider Trader and Value Investor portfolios.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia: Previewing the Leading Chipmaker's Earnings Report",
        "content": "Since the equity markets bottomed in late 2022, tech stocks have driven most of the general market’s gains. For example, over the past year, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) is up a robust 45% while the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) is only up 24%. Drill down further into the performance metrics, and you’ll find that two main areas are driving market gains – mega-cap tech stocks such as the “Magnificent 7” and AI/semiconductor stocks. Currently, Nvidia (NVDA) is the undisputed market leader in both areas.\n\nNvidia is a leading technology company renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and parallel computing solutions. Initially recognized for its contributions to the gaming industry, the company has become indispensable to the AI revolution due to the exceptional parallel processing capabilities of its GPUs. These GPUs excel at handling complex mathematical computations essential for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. Nvidia’s CUDA architecture and specialized hardware have become integral components in accelerating deep learning algorithms, enabling faster and more efficient training of AI models. Their GPUs are widely adopted in data centers and research institutions, playing a pivotal role in powering the computational demands of modern AI applications, from natural language processing to computer vision and autonomous systems.\n\nEPS Due Date\n\nThe world’s third-largest company will report fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, February 21st.\n\nEstimates\n\nZacks Consensus Estimates suggest that NVDA will deliver a scorching triple-digit earnings growth rate over the next three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nESP Score & Revisions\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Nvidia currently sports the coveted Zacks positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Score. The ESP score looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that the more recent information is, the more accurate and better predictor it is of the future. When a company has a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive ESP (like NVDA does), stocks produce a positive surprise 70% of the time while enjoying annual returns of 28.3% on average (according to our 10-year back test).\n\nStory continues\n\nImplied Move\n\nThe implied options move for a stock refers to the market’s expectation of the potential price fluctuation of that stock based on the pricing of its options contracts. Specifically, it is derived from the implied volatility, a key component in option pricing models. If the implied options move is high, it suggests that market participants anticipate significant price swings in the underlying stock. Traders often look at implied volatility to gauge potential risk and adjust their strategies accordingly. The options market implies a move of + or – 11% for this quarter.\n\nEarnings Surprise History\n\nNvidia has beaten Wall Street expectations for four straight quarters and has a positive average surprise of 18.99%. The company has surpassed EPS estimates, revenue estimates, and has upped guidance for four straight Q4 reports and seven of the past eight. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Levels\n\nThe two primary levels for intermediate investors to watch are the rising 10-week moving average (~$600) and the all-time high of ~$750. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSeasonality & Historical Trends\n\nFebruary is the second-best month for Nvidia. 72% of the time the stock is higher in February, with an average return of 8.5% over the past 10 years. Over the last decade, its 2017 return of -7.1% was its lowest.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia is the true market leader in the AI space. Whether you own the stock or not, investors should pay close attention to its Q4 EPS report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.19 points, or 0.17%, to 38,56.80.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart closed at a record high and was the best performer on the Dow Industrials after the U.S. retail giant forecast fiscal 2025 sales largely above Wall Street expectations and raised its annual dividend by 9%.\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer staples index, which includes Walmart, rose 1.13% as sole advancer of the 11 major S&P sectors, while information technology, down 1.27% was the weakest.\n\nShares of fellow Dow component Home Depot alternated between modest gains and losses and before closing up 0.06% after the home improvement retailer forecast full-year results below analysts' estimates.\n\nA weeks-long rally on Wall Street stalled last week, as hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data pushed back market expectations for the timing of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe rate cut is expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the release of minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting as well as remarks from a slew of central bank officials later this week.\n\nSmart-TV maker Vizio jumped 16.26% after Walmart said it would buy the company for $2.3 billion.\n\nDiscover Financial Services shot 12.61% higher on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's plans to acquire the U.S. credit card issuer in a $35.3 billion deal. Capital One shares edged 0.12% higher.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.4 to 1 ratio on the NYSE, while on Nasdaq, decliners topped advancers by 1.9 to 1.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 111 new highs and 95 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 11.67 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.64 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "*\n\nNasdaq leads Wall St losses as Nvidia slides\n\n*\n\nU.S. yields dip with market in consolidation mode\n\n*\n\nChina slashes mortgage rates; yuan steady\n\n*\n\nEuropean wage growth slows, euro zone bond yields slip\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Alun John\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The dollar eased and a gauge of global stock performance fell on Tuesday as fading optimism that central banks will soon cut interest rates dampened sentiment, leaving key pan-European and Japanese stock indices just below their all-time highs.\n\nEurope's broad STOXX 600 benchmark and Japan's Nikkei remain about 1% off their peaks, while a weeks-long rally on Wall Street stalled, despite stellar results from Walmart that lifted its shares to a record high.\n\nHotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data last week pushed back expectations for an imminent start to the Federal Reserve's easing cycle. A rate cut is now expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nThe call for further deflation has depended on below-trend economic growth, but the structural foundation for that outlook is wrong as there is little slack in the U.S. economy, said Phillip Colmar, global strategist at MRB Partners in New York.\n\n\"The whole Goldilocks soft-landing scenario was also wrong,\" he said. \"We like Goldilocks. But our experience is she doesn't visit for very long and the risk to the Goldilocks scenario was that we weren't going to have a soft landing with enough slack in the economy building up to bring down inflation.\"\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.24%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.35%.\n\nThe STOXX 600 index closed down 0.10% as markets ignored European Central Bank data that showed the annual growth in negotiated wages across the euro area slowing to 4.5% in the fourth quarter last year, down from 4.7% in the prior period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ECB has pointed to wages as the biggest risk to its 1-1/2 year crusade against inflation. An ECB analysis of salary agreements indicates wage growth will remain high this year, while the number of companies that expect price increases is rising again, Commerzbank's senior economist Marco Wagner said in a note.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street as chipmaker Nvidia, which reports results after markets close on Wednesday, fell 4.4%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.17%, the S&P 500 lost 0.60% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.92%.\n\nThe response to the interest rate outlook from asset classes other than bonds has been muted so far, but U.S. economic growth compared to elsewhere will likely change the lock-step move for central bank expectations, said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston.\n\nSince mid-January the market has reduced rate cut expectations by 60 basis points for the Fed, the same for the Bank of Canada, 37 basis points for the ECB and 57 basis points for the Bank of England, he said.\n\n\"This change in the U.S. rates market is an economy that is performing in a way that we're not seeing in a lot of the other developed markets. Eventually you're going have to start seeing more separation,\" Loh said.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 4.8 basis points to 4.608%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 2.4 basis points at 4.271%.\n\nGermany's 10-year Bund yield, which moves inversely to its price, was down 0.7 basis points at 2.378%, while the euro was 0.29% higher at $1.0811.\n\nGermany's rate-sensitive two-year yield has risen about 40 bps year to date.\n\nCHINESE RATE CUT\n\nChina's five-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.95%, bigger than the five to 15 bp cuts forecast by economists. The one-year rate was left at 3.45%, helping blue chips to finish the day up 0.2%, after an earlier fall, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to rise 0.6%.\n\nThe yuan touched its lowest in three months in early trade before steadying at 7.1925.\n\nThe dollar weakened after China cut rates in a bid to prop up its struggling property market, raising hopes of additional stimulus that would boost global growth.\n\nThe yen gained but stayed below the 150.88 per dollar level reached last Monday, its weakest in 11 weeks, as investors focus on whether renewed weakness in the Japanese currency is likely to prompt intervention.\n\nOil prices fell more than 1%, with worries about global demand offsetting price support from the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBrent futures settled down $1.22 to $82.34 a barrel. The six-month spread for Brent on Tuesday was at its highest since October, a sign of a tighter market.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for March delivery , which expires Tuesday, settled down $1.01 at $78.18 a barrel. The more actively traded April WTI contract settled down $1.30 at $77.04 a barrel.\n\nGold prices climbed to their highest level in more than a week as the dollar retreated.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,039.80 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; additional reporting by Alun John in London, Tom Westbrook in Singaoor; editing by Ros Russell, Chizu Nomiyama, Chris Reese and Deepa Babington)",

        "content": "Everybody loves Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and company, but let’s be real – the concept of bargain tech stocks makes a lot of sense. At the end of the day, we all love a good deal.\n\nListen, I’m not against buying NVDA for the long haul. However, I can also read numbers. With a trailing-earnings multiple of nearly 96X, it just seems a little rich. Yes, the company represents a juggernaut in the innovation space. As well, the underlying artificial intelligence narrative offers a massive addressable market. However, these catalysts appear priced into the security.\n\nOn the other hand, we have bargain tech stocks. You don’t see too many articles lavishing praise over these enterprises. However, they play important roles in various sectors of the economy. And they’re simply a better deal from a math perspective.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAgain, you don’t need to ignore the hot players because they’ve earned their lofty reputation. However, it’s also not a bad idea to show these bargain tech stocks some love.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational corporation and technology firm, STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) – also known simply as ST – is the largest European semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. Per its website, ST represents a leading supplier of many of the key technologies integrated into next-generation consumer devices, specifically microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits (ICs) designed to govern a certain operation in an embedded system.\n\nFundamentally, the beauty of ST lies in the expansive total addressable market. According to Grand View Research, the global microcontroller sector reached a valuation of $32.37 billion last year. Analysts project that by 2030, the segment could reach just under $70 billion in annual revenue. Driving the case for this outsized growth is the wide utility among diverse industries, including telecommunications, healthcare, and automotive.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, STM trades for only 15.67X forward earnings, lower than the sector median 26X. Covering analysts see shares reaching $48. However,  the high-side target comes out to $55, implying about 22% upside potential. Therefore, it’s a solid idea for bargain tech stocks to consider.\n\nIbex (IBEX) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nBilled as an elite customer experience (CX) outsourcer, Ibex (NASDAQ:IBEX) serves a broad range of enterprise-level clients, from startups to scale-ups, and blue-chip giants. Per its website, the company builds powerful customer engagement and insight solutions to help protect client investments, mitigate financial and operational risk, and accelerate return on investment.\n\nAs with STMicroelectronics, Ibex may not be a household name here. Nevertheless, it enjoys a massive addressable market. Per Fortune Business Insights, the CX market reached a valuation of $14.95 billion in 2022. From 2023 to 2030, analysts anticipate that the space can expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR0 of 16.6%. If so, the industry could be worth $52.54 billion at the forecast period’s culmination.\n\nPresently, IBEX trades at only 7.29X forward earnings. That’s well below the software industry’s median stat of 24.27X. Lastly, it makes a case for bargain tech stocks thanks to analysts pegging shares a moderate buy with a $19.75 target, which implies almost 36% upside potential.\n\nDaktronics (DAKT) Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market Returns. Tech Stocks to buy\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou may not know the name but chances are, you’ve seen the products of Daktronics (NASDAQ:DAKT). Designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing video displays, scoreboards, digital billboards and dynamic message signs, Daktronics is responsible for getting the word out in the crowded and competitive modern digital ecosystem.\n\nTo be fair, the broader discretionary consumer economy faces significant questions. With many companies issuing layoffs, Daktronics’ ability to sell advertising displays may seem limited. Conspicuously, DAKT stock dipped about 10% since the start of the year. Nevertheless, because consumer dollars are limited, companies must fight for every greenback. That could counterintuitively help Daktronics.\n\nFurther, with the red ink, DAKT now trades at a lowly earnings multiple of 6.67X without non-recurring items (NRI). As well, shares trade at a revenue multiple of only 0.43X. And aside from a hiccup in 2019, the company has been consistently profitable.\n\nCurrently, DAKT features one analyst buy rating with a $12.80 price target, implying 66% growth potential. Thus, it’s one of the bargain tech stocks to put on your watch list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Rosenblatt Securities Analyst Hans Mosemann has raised the price target on Super Micro shares to $1,300 while maintaining its Buy rating.\n\nYahoo Finance Live examines Super Micro Computer's stock movements ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) fourth-quarter earnings expected out tomorrow, Wednesday, February 21.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Checking in on some of today's top trending tickers. Let's start with Super Micro Computer here. They're sliding in today's trade, along with some of the other big chip companies. This coming despite one Wall Street analyst raising the price target on the stock.\n\nRosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann increased his price target on Super Micro Computer to $1,300 from $700 while maintaining his buy rating. So Julie, the biggest bull on the Street right now, it's official. Team at Rosenblatt, they go to $1,300 for the server maker.\n\nThey say it's going to keep benefiting from the AI boom, basically. And the money line here, I think, is key to this story they tell their clients, is for investors to consider that the company is benefiting not only from secular AI growth but material share gains, too. And stocks slipping a bit today, but it's still up about 700% in the past 12 months.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting if you look at the whole chip space today because being led by Nvidia downward even ahead of its earnings tomorrow. And as we've talked about, I don't think we have talked to a single analyst, even among people who follow the industry very, very closely, who are not bullish on Nvidia. Nearly everyone is. But there was an interesting note that someone shared with me from JPMorgan today that said of Nvidia, clients are either already in the stock or they won't chase the pop and they've resigned themselves to looking elsewhere within the chip industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nCertainly, Super Micro has been one of those companies that has benefited from that. JPMorgan also mentioned stocks like Broadcom and TSMC as potential beneficiaries, or other places that people are looking right now. And we are in this interesting period where Nvidia has been a rocket ship. And for those lucky enough to be riding it, they're quite happy, and others are just sort of trying to figure out where to pick their spots right now.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, and it's show time tomorrow for Nvidia, for sure, after the bell. The focus, of course, behind the earnings and, of course, the guide, for sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, most definitely.",

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence can make you a millionaire if you pick the right stocks to invest in. Had you invested in Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) based on my recommendation in 2021, you would be sitting on huge gains today. However the competition is rising. Not every tech company will be able to be a leader in the AI industry. If you have been investing in AI stocks, it is time to reevaluate your options. After that, sell the stocks that do not show an upside potential. A few stocks simply rally due to the AI hype and do not have the potential to deliver. It is best to get rid of them while you can. Here are the three overhyped AI stocks to sell this month.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3IoT (AI) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn emerging leader in the Artificial Intelligence space, C3.ai (NYSE:AI)  has grown significantly in 2023. It hit a high of $46 in June 2023 but has been on a downward spree since then. The stock was at an all-time high of $161 in Dec 2020. However, it hasn’t been able to see those days again.\n\nWhile I do believe in the company’s ability to build AI applications for businesses, I am worried about the rising competition in the industry. I do not think the company has the scalability to withstand competition and achieve profitability anytime soon. It is reporting double-digit revenue growth, but it isn’t profitable yet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock is down 9% over the past six months. The management has been promising profitability for a while now. Earlier, the company was aiming for a profit in 2024, but it is now expecting to report a profit in the second half of 2025. I will only believe it when I see it. The competition is intense, and the industry is rewarding AI stocks, but not all the stocks are going to win.\n\nOn the other hand, C3.ai has been growing losses. Its guidance for full-year operating loss is expected between $115 million to $135 million. This is more than the loss of the same period prior year. C3.ai may have the right products, but fundamentally, the company doesn’t look in good shape. It is best to sell the stock while you can make some money out of it. While C3.ai does have something to offer, it might not be the best AI stock right now. You can see why it made our list of AI stocks to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nChinese tech giant Baidu (NYSE:BIDU) stock is down 23% in the year and 7% year to date. Trading at $107 today, the stock is down from the highs of $339 it enjoyed in 2021. The company owns the largest online search engine in China and makes most of its revenue from the online marketing business.\n\nWith a cooldown in China’s market, Baidu saw a drop in online marketing revenue and it continued to spend money on AI-related investments. Still, its cloud business hasn’t been able to achieve much over the past few years and has a very small market share.\n\nThe company is unprofitable, and its losses are mounting. For the past six months, the stock has been trading in the range of $100 to $146, and I do not think it will rally anytime soon. The company is growing at a very slow pace, and by the time it achieves the AI goals, it could be too late. Investors shouldn’t bet on this company until they see the numbers improve.\n\nIt hasn’t been able to convince the businesses of its AI power over the past two years, and with the United States ban on exports of chips to China, it could become a tough ride for the company to survive. Without the necessary chips, it might not be possible to run the AI models or applications and this could put a break in Baidu’s growth story. Sell the stock before it dips below $100.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has been seeing major ups and downs over the past few weeks. The inflation report took the stock down even though the company reported impressive quarterly results, it later went from $77 to $$113 in just one day. The swings in ARM stock do not sit well with me and it reminds me of the meme stocks which were solely driven by the AI hype.\n\nThe company has recently gone public, and its strong financials with a highly optimistic outlook about the demand for microchips has led to a surge in the stock price. However, I am uncertain of how sustainable the company’s growth is.\n\nAlso, the 180-day post-IPO lockup period will end next month and this is when insiders could sell their shares to take profits. It could lead to a strong dip in the price. Due to the lockup, only 9.5% of the shares are currently traded and the remaining will become eligible for trading in March.\n\nFor a newly listed company, such a rally in stock price could mean a red flag. Selling ARM stock while it is at its peak could be a smart move. The company is genuine, but the stock is selling at a premium, and if you want to invest, wait for a dip before you make the move. If you already own the stock, sell it and make the most of the recent upside. After that, make sure you also dropped the other AI stocks to sell we mentioned.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade. Revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed 184% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), which saw their shares rise 91% and 67%, respectively.\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads over Nvidia.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adj. EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Robin Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is losing ground in Tuesday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 5.9% as of 1 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nWhile there isn't any business-specific news pushing Nvidia lower today, the stock is losing ground due to macroeconomic concerns and underwhelming business results from some major players in the retail space. In particular, the graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist's share price is being pushed lower due to results and commentary from Walmart and Home Depot.\n\nWhy are retail results impacting the AI leader's stock?\n\nWhile there might not seem to be much immediate overlap between Nvidia and retail, Walmart and Home Depot are often viewed as bellwethers for the broader economy. Their quarterly results can provide a lot of valuable information about consumer sentiment and overall macroeconomic conditions, and Wall Street didn't like what it saw when the two companies reported earnings before market open this morning.\n\nWhile Walmart beat earnings expectations and issued encouraging forward guidance, the company's guidance could be taken as a sign that the economy is still running hot and that inflation isn't tapering enough. Home Depot was more explicit with its comments on inflation, stating that it was seeing unfavorable demand trends due to persistent inflation.\n\nIn addition to raising another red flag that the Federal Reserve's battle with inflation hasn't been won yet, Home Depot's comments could also be interpreted as a negative indicator for the housing market. Stocks don't trade in a vacuum, and Nvidia's valuation is feeling that today.\n\nWhat comes next for Nvidia?\n\nEven with today's pullback, Nvidia stock has risen roughly 218% over the last year. The company's explosive gains have largely been powered by surging AI-driven demand for its high-end GPUs, but expectations that the Fed will begin cutting interest rates in the near future have also played a major part in the rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf it looks like the central banking authority will push rate cuts further out, it could dampen bullish momentum for Nvidia. But in the ultra-near term, investors have a crucial event to narrow in on.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings results after the market closes tomorrow, and it's poised to be one of the most important stock market events of 2024. With its last update, the company guided for sales of roughly $20 billion -- suggesting growth of nearly 231%. While recent demand trends suggest there's a good chance the GPU leader will beat that guidance, the explosive run-up for its stock means that performance will be under the microscope -- and investors will be expecting perfection.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Companies large and small are racing to roll out new AI features for both consumers and businesses, monetizing their products and gaining market share in the process. The market for AI shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence forecasts that generative AI is likely to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% over the next decade. It is expected to become a $1.3 trillion industry worldwide. AI also has the promise to transform society as we know it. It can alter everything from the way we work and interact with one another to the entertainment we consume.\n\nWith so much at stake, it should come as no surprise that both established companies and start-ups are pulling out all the stops to get ahead in the AI race. Here are three AI stocks to turn $10,000 into $1 million in February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chart\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nAI chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reports its latest earnings on Feb. 21, and expectations could not be higher. Forecasts are calling for earnings per share (EPS) of $4.59, a more than 700% increase from the same quarter of last year. Some analysts are referring to the upcoming print as a make-or-break moment for the stock market. In a note to clients, Deutsche Bank said: “The most important event of the week may be Nvidia’s earnings…this will be very important for sentiment.”\n\nAs for helping investors get rich, NVDA stock is already up 50% this year, bringing its 12-month gain to 252%. Options trading activity indicates that Nvidia’s shares could rise a further 11% or more after its latest quarterly results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. Nvidia’s market capitalization now stands at $1.8 trillion, surpassing both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nStory continues\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a lesser-known name. Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is not a microchip or semiconductor maker but is an AI company all the same. Symbotic is a robotics warehouse automation company based in Massachusetts. It builds and operates robots and automated systems for warehouses using proprietary AI in its software. While SYM stock has pulled back since the start of this year, it comes after a blistering rally in 2023. In the last 12 months, the stock has risen 155% and it is up 312% since going public in 2022.\n\nA few weeks ago, the company reported earnings that topped its own forecasts. Symbotic announced $14 million in adjusted EBITDA on revenue of $368 million. The company’s sales were up 79% from a year earlier. Symbotic had forecast earnings of $11 million on sales of $350 million. It was the company’s second quarter in a row of adjusted profitability, which is a good sign for the future. Should Symbotic continue reporting strong sales and profits, it likely won’t be long until its stock is rallying again.\n\nAI Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A person sits at a open laptop with Google open on the screen, while holding a phone with Google search also open on the screen. GOOG stock, GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: PK Studio / Shutterstock\n\nStill out front in the global AI race is Alphabet. The company remains all-in on AI, recently rebranding its main AI chatbot as “Gemini” and replacing the former name “Bard.” Google’s parent said it is making the change to be consistent with the name of its large-language learning models that are used to train AI applications. The name Bard was originally unveiled with the beta launch of Alphabet’s first AI chatbot in March 2023.\n\nAlong with the rebrand, Alphabet announced it is launching a new mobile version of its chatbot as well as a premium paid-subscription version called “Gemini Advanced.” Alphabet is among the first companies to start monetizing its AI offerings. Alphabet executives said they are working towards building an advanced AI assistant for both consumers and businesses. Gemini Advanced is priced at $19.99 a month, including two terabytes of cloud storage that can be shared among family members.\n\nAlphabet is cascading its AI capabilities across its suite of office products, including Gmail, Docs, Slides, Sheets, and Meet. GOOGL stock has gained 53% in the last 12 months. A $10,000 investment in Alphabet’s stock on the date of its 2004 initial public offering (IPO) would be worth more than $300,000 today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and GOOGL.

        "content": "(Adds dateline, byline, comment in paragraphs 5-6, 12-14; updates prices at 12 p.m. (1700 GMT))\n\n*\n\nNasdaq leads Wall St losses as Nvidia slides\n\n*\n\nU.S. yields dip as market in consolidation mode\n\n*\n\nChina slashes mortgage rates; yuan steady, stocks edge higher\n\n*\n\nEuropean wage growth slows, euro zone bond yields slip\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Alun John\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The dollar eased and stocks on Wall Street and in Europe fell on Tuesday as fading optimism that central banks will soon cut interest rates weighed on sentiment, keeping key pan-European and Japanese stock indices from breaching record highs.\n\nWalmart kicked off the earnings season for U.S. retailers on an upbeat note, helping limit losses on the Dow, but Europe's broad STOXX 600 benchmark and Japan's Nikkei remain about 1% below respective record peaks in 2022 and 1989.\n\nHotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data last week snuffed market expectations for an imminent start to the Federal Reserve's easing cycle and halted a rally for U.S. stocks in 2024 that was based on an outlook of inflation slowing further.\n\nThe Fed will cut the federal funds rate in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters who also said the first rate cut would come later than forecast rather than earlier.\n\nThe call for further deflation has depended on below-trend economic growth, but the structural foundation for that outlook is wrong as there is little slack in the economy, said Phillip Colmar, global strategist at MRB Partners in New York.\n\n\"The whole Goldilocks soft-landing scenario was also wrong,\" he said. \"We like Goldilocks. But our experience is she doesn't visit for very long and the risk to the Goldilocks scenario was that we weren't going to have a soft landing with enough slack in the economy building up to bring down inflation.\"\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.30%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe STOXX 600 index lost 0.09% as markets ignored European Central Bank data that showed the annual growth in negotiated wages across the euro area slowing to 4.5% in the fourth quarter last year, down from 4.7% in the prior period.\n\nThe ECB has singled out wages as the single-biggest risk to its 1-1/2 year crusade against inflation.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq led losses on Wall Street as chipmaker Nvidia, which reports results after markets close on Wednesday, fell 6.2%.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25%, the S&P 500 lost 0.78% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.42%.\n\nThe response to the interest rate outlook from asset classes other than bonds has been muted so far, but U.S. economic growth compared to elsewhere will likely change the move in lock-step for central bank expectations, said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at State Street in Boston.\n\nSince mid-January the market has reduced rate cut expectations by 60 basis points for the Fed, the same for the Bank of Canada, 37 basis points for the ECB and 57 basis points for the Bank of England, he said.\n\n\"This change in the U.S. rates market is an economy that is performing in a way that we're not seeing in a lot of the other developed markets. Eventually you're going have to start seeing more separation,\" Loh said.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 7.6 basis points to 4.580%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 4.1 basis points at 4.254%.\n\nGermany's 10-year Bund yield, which moves inversely to its price, was down 3.8 basis points at 2.373%, while the euro was 0.32% higher at $1.0814.\n\nThe euro zone's benchmark yield has risen around 35 bps so far this year as bumps in the road to lower inflation and better than feared economic data in most of the world, particularly the United States, has caused markets to push back their late-2023 expectations of significant rate cuts early this year.\n\nGermany's rate-sensitive two-year yield has risen 40 bps year to date.\n\nCHINESE RATE CUT\n\nChina's five-year loan prime rate was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.95%, bigger than the five to 15 bp cuts forecast by economists. The one-year rate was left at 3.45%, helping blue chips to finish the day up 0.2%, after an earlier fall, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to rise 0.6%.\n\nThe yuan touched its lowest in three months in early trade before steadying at 7.1979 in the European morning.\n\nU.S. crude recently fell 0.42% to $78.86 per barrel and Brent was at $82.41, down 1.38% on the day.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; additional reporting by Alun John in London, Tom Westbrook in Singaoor; editing by Ros Russell, Chizu Nomiyama and Chris Reese)",

        "content": "On the heels of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) surpassing 5,000 for the first time earlier this month, Goldman Sachs has raised its year-end forecast for the index to 5,200 amid an upbeat earnings outlook. Several major companies like Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) have posted stronger-than-expected results on Tuesday. However, all eyes are now on Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings report, due out after the bell on Wednesday, February 21.\n\nYahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo and Akiko Fujita break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Earnings. Goldman Sachs is boosting its year end target for the S&P 500 citing an improved earnings outlook. And we got a good gauge on the consumer from big box retailers Walmart and Home Depot this morning, it is all about Nvidia. Those results out after the closing bell on Wednesday and Rochelle, some interesting moves ahead of those results. Take a look at where Nvidia stock is trading today down about 5% right now.\n\nI mean, you could argue this is a stock that has been really priced for perfection blow blowout earnings over the last several quarters. Maybe a bit of profit taking happening there as well. And maybe investors getting a bit more cautious about whether, in fact NVIDIA can meet expectations. It's worth pointing out this specific number though from Vanda Research.\n\nNVIDIA trading volumes have made up an average of roughly 8% of daily trading volumes. That's more than Tesla at 7%. So that shows you how honed in investors are on this particular stock and we're going to get those results tomorrow, could be a big mover.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, you have to figure, given all the hype going into this given its meteoric rise just over the past few years, ever since the generative AI boom continued to launch last year, so much seems to be riding on this earnings data. And if you actually look for the last seven years, NVIDIA has actually beaten on earnings per share estimates, sales estimates and raised guidance every quarter except for a revenue miss in 2019.\n\nAnd that was of course, even before what we've seen with the developments with generative AI. I mean, some of the pullback that we're seeing, as you mentioned perhaps some caution, perhaps some profit taking, perhaps a healthy pullback, considering stocks can't just go up and up and up because then you end up with a bubble.\n\nSo perhaps a bit of a pause here and obviously seeing some of the other chip makers falling in solidarity as well. But we'll continue to track that.",

Tesla shares fell 3.9%.\n\n\"The sellout that we're seeing today is driven by the reversal in SMCI (Super Micro Computer) because a lot of hot money was chasing these AI names and then we had the vicious selloff on Friday,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.\n\nShares in Super Micro Computer extended losses by 11.3%, after finishing down 20% on Friday as investors took a break from betting on the stock as a big beneficiary of strong AI technology demand.\n\nWalmart hit a record high and was last up 3.4% after the U.S. retail giant forecast fiscal 2025 sales largely above Wall Street expectations and raised its annual dividend by 9%. This helped cushion the impact on Dow Jones.\n\nThe S&P 500 consumer staples sector, which houses Walmart, rose 1.1%, while information technology dropped 1.8%.\n\nA weeks-long rally on Wall Street was stalled by hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data last week that dampened market expectations for an imminent start to the Federal Reserve's easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rate cut is expected in June, according to a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters, who also flagged risk of a further delay in the first cut.\n\nInvestors are awaiting the release of minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting as well as remarks from a slew of central bank officials later this week.\n\nAt 11:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 49.57 points, or 0.13%, at 38,578.42, the S&P 500 was down 32.50 points, or 0.65%, at 4,973.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 195.28 points, or 1.24%, at 15,580.37.\n\nSmart-TV maker Vizio jumped 14.9% after Walmart said it would buy the company for $2.3 billion.\n\nDiscover Financial Services surged 14.4% on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's plans to acquire the U.S. credit card issuer in a $35.3 billion deal.\n\nIntel added 0.6% following a report on Friday that the Biden administration is in talks to award more than $10 billion in subsidies to the semiconductor firm.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 27 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 53 new highs and 65 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Is Up 0.67% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Nvidia (NVDA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NVDA that show why this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor NVDA, shares are up 0.67% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry is up 0.56% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 21.72% compares favorably with the industry's 3.08% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Nvidia have increased 50.52% over the past quarter, and have gained 239.5% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.28% and 24.37%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also take note of NVDA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NVDA is averaging 45,667,384 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with NVDA.\n\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NVDA's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.29 to $12.34 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NVDA is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Nvidia on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia's stock rally sputters ahead of quarterly report",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A scorching rally in Nvidia's shares this year came to a halt on Tuesday as investors worried if the high-flying chip designer's quarterly results would justify its towering valuation.\n\nThe stock fell 5.3% to $687.91. If losses hold, it could be the biggest percentage drop in more than eight months.\n\nNvidia has been at the heart of the frenzy around artificial intelligence (AI). A more than 40% surge in its stock this year helped it replace Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company, behind Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe market capitalization of Nvidia was $1.79 trillion on Friday.\n\n\"The market is maybe a little bit hesitant whether they (Nvidia) can deliver a strong enough guidance to reinvigorate the market even higher,\" said Frank Lee, head of technology research at HSBC.\n\nThe company will report quarterly results on Feb. 21. Analysts expect earnings of $4.56 a share and revenue to rise to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year earlier, according to LSEG estimates.\n\nStill, Nvidia's eye-popping run this year that pushed it to new peaks and powered gains in U.S. stock markets could make the stock vulnerable if earnings are less than stunning.\n\n\"You can't come out and simply meet or slightly beat for the stock to go higher, Nvidia's going to need to blow it away,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading.\n\nNvidia options are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS.\n\nOther AI-focused stocks such as Super Micro Computer fell 11.6% and Arm Holdings dropped 7.3%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices was down nearly 6%, having recorded double-digit gains on a year-to-date basis.\n\nNvidia's shares are trading at 32 times its forward earnings estimates compared with the industry median of 25.4.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, additional reporting by Arsheeya Singh Bajwa and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

        "content": "(Adds details and background in paragraphs 3-7)\n\nFeb 20 (Reuters) - Microsoft is developing a new network card that could improve the performance of its Maia AI server chip and potentially reduce the company's reliance on chip designer Nvidia, The Information reported on Tuesday.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has tapped Pradeep Sindhu, who co-founded networking gear developer Juniper Networks, to spearhead the network card effort, the report said citing a person with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft acquired Sindhu's server chip startup, Fungible, last year.\n\nThe new network card is similar to Nvidia's ConnectX-7 card, which the chip developer sells alongside its graphic processor units (GPUs), the report added.\n\nThe equipment could take more than a year to develop and, if successful, could lessen the time it takes for OpenAI to train its models on Microsoft servers as well as make the process less expensive, according to the report.\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and has incorporated its technology in a wide variety of products, giving the Windows-maker a leg up in the race to sell artificial-intelligence software.\n\nThe company had introduced Maia, a chip meant to run large language models and support AI computing, in November.

The price target represented a potential 16% upside from where shares traded when the update was announced. The analyst added \"We believe Nvidia will remain as the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate.\"\n\nNvidia is up 42.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $685.87 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $739 from February 2024.

The company lacked specificity that the market craves when discussing its full-year 2024 EBITDA forecast (it stated that EBITDA would be \"positive\" rather than sharing a number - Wall Street was expecting $100 million of EBITDA for 2024). Management cited challenging macroeconomic conditions and an uneven ad market recovery, and they anticipate seasonal revenue declines in line with Q1 2023, alongside tough year-over-year growth rate comparisons in streaming services distribution and a challenging media and entertainment landscape. Additionally, the company has averaged 8% upside to Wall Street's revenue estimates since Q3 2022, so Roku's more modest beat this quarter may be causing investors to level set with regards to expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a more positive note, Roku beat analysts' revenue expectations as it grew its user base and outperformed in its Platform and Devices segments. Its revenue guidance for next quarter also topped analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed mixed, but the market was likely expecting more.\n\nRoku is down 24.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $67.48 per share it is trading 36.9% below its 52-week high of $106.87 from November 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Roku's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,258.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future.

        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, February 21. Stifel currently holds the Magnificent Seven tech stock component at a Buy rating with an $865 per share price target.\n\nStifel Applied Technology Analyst Ruben Roy examines several of the top drivers expected to weigh on Nvidia earnings, including AI infrastructure and CPU product pipelines.\n\n\"It's an unlikely situation where we see sort of a miss and guide lower, but anything could happen, and certainly that would be taken as a meaningful negative, I would say, into the ecosystem of AI as we think about the broader companies that are involved here,\" Roy tells Yahoo Finance. \"Throughout earnings season, the news has been rather positive on this broadening of capital spending into a lot of other companies that will benefit from AI infrastructure.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: If NVIDIA comes out and misses on this, what is potentially, a Goldilocks report, is that the rug pull on the broader markets, especially given how AI has fueled this rally?\n\nRUBEN ROY: That would be tough because, there's, obviously, a lot of expectations here. One of the things that we've been talking about with our tech team here at Stifel has been this concept of broadening of AI infrastructure spend. And we are starting to see that with things like AI networking. Companies that are exposed to interconnecting these GPU clusters, and then out into the rest of the data center and rest of the world.\n\nAnd those numbers have been going up, Brad. So I think it's an unlikely situation where we see a miss and got lower. But anything can happen. Certainly, that would be taken as a pretty meaningful negative, I would say, into the ecosystem of AI, as we think about the broader companies that are involved here.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut like I said, throughout earnings season, the news has been rather positive on this broadening of capital spending into a lot of other companies that will benefit from AI infrastructure\n\nSEANA SMITH: Ruben, you mentioned just a moment ago that GPU tech conference that's coming up next month, any idea-- just give us a sense just about what you think the pipeline updates is going to sound like or is going to look like, and what you think NVIDIA sees in terms of that growth opportunity, the TAM, the total addressable market, here for their chips in the longer term.\n\nRUBEN ROY: Yeah. It's a great question because I think that's really a focus area that we've been looking at, which is that NVIDIA is expanding their technologies that are coming into this area of spend. So not just the GPU hardware, not just the software that goes along with it or the networking products that are very necessary, but they're expanding. They started shipping a CPU for the first time into these types of deployments.\n\nSo they've got an ARM-based CPU. I think that the cadence of their technology coming to market is increasing. So instead of GPUs coming to market every two years, they're trying to increase that to potentially bring out new technologies every year.\n\nThey've got, as you folks might know, H100 and H200 are the leading edge of the GPUs that are going out into these AI infrastructure builds. Today, they've got a new set of technologies coming out that we expect to be launched later on this year, which we'll probably talk about.\n\nAnd so I think it's really that it's a question of expanding their technology that they're bringing to the table across both hardware and software, as well as the networking. And so I think that's going to be an important area for investors to focus on.",

        "title": "Cisco's Expanded Partnership With Nvidia Overshadowed By The \"Price\" It Has To Pay For Its AI And Cybersecurity Shift",
        "content": "Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) joined Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN),Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) in entering 2024 with job cuts as it announced it will be decreasing its workforce by 5% which implies eliminating about 4,250 jobs. Although Cisco reported it expanded its AI deployment and management partnership with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) earlier in February, its good news were dimmed by a light forecast, both for the current quarter and the full year. By deepening the partnership with Nvidia, Cisco got to focus on data centers. Cisco and Nvidia will provide easy to deploy and manage AI infrastructure solutions to data centers. Through their purpose-built Ethernet networking-based solutions, Nvidia and Cisco promise to enable the massive computing power that companies need to make it in the AI era.\n\nCisco’s Fiscal Second Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on January 27th , Cisco reported that revenue declined 6% YoY. Networking products brought $7.08 billion, slightly below StreetAccount’s $7.10 billion consensus estimate.\n\nNet income also fell to $2.63 billion, with earnings per share falling 3%. Adjusted earnings amounted to 87 cents, topping LSEG’s estimate of 84 cents.\n\nA Cautious Outlook Due To Macroeconomic Challenges\n\nCisco expects to its $28 billion acquisition of machine learning and cyber security software maker Splunk during the current, third fiscal, quarter, or early in the second calendar, which is fiscal third, quarter. EU antitrust regulators have set March 13th as a deadline to decide whether they’ll clear Cisco’s bid that would help reduce its reliance on its networking equipment business that has faced both a slowdown and supply chain challenges.\n\nFor the current, fiscal third, quarter, Cisco guided for 84 to 86 cents in adjusted earnings per share and revenue in the range between $12.1 billion and $12.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs for the full fiscal year, Cisco guided for adjusted earnings between $3.68 and $3.74, and revenue between $51.5 billion and $52.5 billion. However, this guidance does not account for the impact from Splunk.\n\nGetting Into AI Has Its Cost, And It’s A Hefty One\n\nConsidering that even Microsoft, Amazon and Google kicked off the new year by slashing staff, these layoffs clearly indicate tighter times for tech companies. With tech companies pouring billions into AI development, Cisco merely followed suit and joined Microsoft, Amazon, Google, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ: DUOL), with Layoffs.fyi. estimating that 34,000 tech employees have been laid off year-to-date. In January, Google dismissed hundreds of employees from hardware and internal software divisions to reverse its pandemic hiring spree. Amazon announced targeted job cuts across its film and television studio, with Audible and Buy With Prime divisions also cutting 5% of their workforce. PayPal will be reducing its workforce count by 9% this year, after announcing a 7% cut last year. After its acquisition of Activision Blizzard that will undoubtedly strengthen its position in gaming, Microsoft needed to sacrifice about 8% of its video game staff which represent less than 1% of the tech titan’s total workforce. Therefore, the internet networking pioneer, Cisco, is merely doing what everyone else is. Downsizing and layoffs are merely the cost of focusing on key priorities and growth areas such as AI.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because NVIDIA is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NVDA in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $4.71 per share for NVDA, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NVDA, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.67% heading into earnings season.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that NVDA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NVIDIA, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, recent data from executive search firm Spencer Stuart suggests that conventional might not be the best way to handle the future changes all industries go through.\n\n“What worked at a CEO’s last job — at a different company with a different team facing a different set of micro and macro problems — is just not likely to work again.” stated Bloomberg Opinion contributor Beth Kowitt.\n\nAccording to Spencer Stuart consultant Cathy Anterasian, who specializes in CEO succession, almost 30% of new S&P 500 CEOs in 2022 were under 50, double 2018 levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs Kowitt finished her Feb. 12 opinion piece, “refusing to move on to the next generation of leaders can be a risk all its own.”\n\nIn fact, if you look at some of the most successful CEOs over the last 25 years, more than a few were 40 or under.\n\nHere are three under-50 S&P 500 CEOs with must-buy stocks.\n\nMatthew Meloy, Targa Resources (TRGP) Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky above\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMatthew Meloy has been CEO of Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP) since March 1, 2020.

At the time, analysts really liked its stock – 19 out of 20 rated it a Buy, with a target price of $98.50 – and I like the fact that its price-to-free cash flow was only 6.68. The inverse is free cash flow yield. Targa’s was 14.7%. Anything over 8% is value territory.\n\nWhere is it today?\n\nThere are 22 analysts covering its stock with 21 rating it a Buy and a $106 target price, 10% higher than where it’s currently trading. Based on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $826.2 million and a market capitalization of $21.6 billion, its free cash yield is 3.8%, which is slightly below fair value.\n\nStory continues\n\nYielding 2.1%, you pay more for quality.\n\nHassane El-Khoury, ON Semiconductor (ON) AI.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHassane El-Khoury has been CEO of ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) since December 2020. El-Khoury was 43 as of the company’s 2023 proxy.\n\nSince taking the top job of the provider of intelligent power and sensing solutions for the automotive and industrial markets, ON shares have increased by 163%.\n\nEl-Khoury had been the CEO of Cypress Semiconductor until its sale to Infineon Technologies (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) in April 2020 for 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion). Khoury, who hails from Lebanon, worked at Cypress for 13 years, becoming its CEO in August 2016.\n\nWhile its corporate name is ON Semiconductor, it operates under the Onsemi brand, which generated $8.3 billion in revenue and $2.26 billion in non-GAAP income in 2023.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2027, it plans to grow its revenue by 11% compounded annually at the midpoint of its guidance, with annual free cash flow of $3.75 billion in 2027 – it was $402 million in 2023, down from $1.63 billion, due to a 50% increase in capital expenditures toward its future growth – which should lead to a much higher share price.\n\nOf the 34 analysts covering its stock, 19 rate it a Buy, with a target price of $90.00, 14% higher than where it’s currently trading.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to believe but Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will only turn 40 this May.\n\nHe is the fourth wealthiest person on the planet with a net worth of $170 billion. In 2024, alone, his wealth increased by nearly $42 billion, more than double Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang. Zuckerberg has been CEO since founding the company in 2004.\n\nThere is no question that Meta’s revival over the past year – its stock is up 175% over the past 52 weeks – is one of the most significant turnarounds in recent history. It was dead in the water in early 2022 after reporting Facebook’s first ever drop in daily users.\n\n“Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be keen to coax the world into an alternate reality, but disappointing fourth-quarter results were quick to burst his metaverse bubble,” The Guardian reported Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Laura Hoy’s comments about the company’s 2021 results.\n\nIn 2021, it had operating income of $46.8 billion on $117.93 billion in revenue, good for a 39.7% operating margin. In 2023, it had an operating profit of $46.75 billion on $134.90 billion in revenue, 500 basis points lower than in 2021.\n\nHowever, when you consider how far it fell in 2022, the rebound is astounding. Further, it’s got plenty of irons in the fire to keep driving revenue and operating profits higher.\n\nNow, if it could only get its Reality Labs business making money, he’d soon become the world’s wealthiest person.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Regains $1 Trillion Market Cap",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally has resumed after a two-week pause, with Bitcoin (BTC) regaining its $1 trillion market cap for the first time since December 2021. Bitcoin breached the $52,000 mark on Feb 15 and has since then held on to it. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has gained more than 25% this year after a solid 2023.\n\nBitcoin Poised to Surge\n\nThere are several reasons behind Bitcoin’s recent rally. However, the biggest factor has been the January approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. In one of the most important events in the history of Bitcoin, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early January.\n\nThe crypto rally gained momentum in the final months of 2023 on expectations that the SEC would give a green signal anytime. The cryptocurrency declined sharply in the last weeks of January, falling as much as $39,000. However, the positive sentiment is back.\n\nThe spot Bitcoin ETF approval was given with the aim to push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, which would give a long-term boost to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nIn a significant development, data from CryptoQuant indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs have garnered $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their launch on Jan 10, reflecting the growing investor interest.\n\nBesides, Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event is expected in April, which is likely to halve the mining reward for new blocks. Historically, this event has heightened scarcity, creating challenges for miners to acquire net Bitcoins. As a result, there tends to be an increase in Bitcoin's value due to the constrained supply.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 269.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc. MARA is a digital asset technology company. MARA mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 95.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 30.8% over the last 60 days. MARA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nBlackRock, Inc. BLK is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 60 days. BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. COIN offers financial infrastructure and technology to support the global cryptocurrency economy. COIN provides a main financial account for consumers in the crypto space, a marketplace with liquidity for institutional crypto asset transactions, and technology and services for developers to build crypto-based applications and accept cryptocurrencies securely as payment.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 30.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 36.4% over the last 60 days. Coinbase currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "5 Best-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks Halfway Through Q1",
        "content": "After a weak start to 2024, Wall Street regained momentum, driven by a solid earnings season, a resilient economy and a technology surge. In fact, the S&P 500 topped the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever earlier this month.\r\n\r\nAs such, we have highlighted five stocks from the S&P 500 that have gained more than 25% halfway through the first quarter and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), or #3 (Hold). These are Nvidia NVDA, Eli Lilly and Company LLY, Meta Platforms META, Uber Technologies, Inc UBER and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nTotal fourth-quarter earnings of the 387 S&P 500 members who have reported results so far increased 5.1% from the prior-year period on 3.4% higher revenues. Of the companies that reported results, 79.1% beat EPS estimates and 65.1% surpassed revenue estimates. The pace of earnings and revenue growth represents an acceleration from the last couple of quarters, with the technology sector being a major contributor to this improving trend. Notably, the earnings growth is the best growth rate for the S&P 500 companies since the 6.5% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nThe resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the stock market ascent, although it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors like robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession. This economic resilience, coupled with surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence, has been a significant driver of the market's upward trajectory.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 47% so far this year. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 23 cents over the past month for the fiscal year ending January 2025 and has an estimated growth of 64.5%.\r\n\r\nNvidia has a Zacks Rank #2 at present and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. It boasts a diversified product profile, including a solid lineup of new and successful drugs. It also has a dependable pipeline as it navigates through challenges like patent expirations of several drugs and rising pricing pressure on its U.S. diabetes franchise. The stock has rallied 34% this year.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly has an estimated earnings growth rate of 96.2% for this year. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of B.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock has jumped 34% so far this year. Meta saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.91 over the past month for this year, with an estimated earnings growth rate of 31.9%.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\r\n\r\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, excluding China and Southeast Asia. The stock has gained 27.3% so far this year. Uber saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 8 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 32.2%.\r\n\r\nThe stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nRalph Lauren is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia and internationally. It offers products in apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. The stock has risen 25.4% so far this year.

        "title": "NVIDIA (NVDA) Q4 Earnings to Gain From Datacenter Chip Demand",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 21.\n\nNVIDIA's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is expected to showcase the ongoing robustness of its Datacenter segment. This segment is likely to have experienced significant growth fueled by the rising demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models utilizing GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA achieved record revenues in its data center end market, driven primarily by increased investments in generative AI. Revenues from the Datacenter segment surged by 279% year over year and 41% sequentially in the last reported quarter.\n\nIt is anticipated that this trend is likely to have persisted in the quarter under review. Projections estimate fourth-quarter revenues for the data center end market to reach $16.4 billion, representing substantial year-over-year growth of 354.2% and a sequential increase of 13%.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nGenAI Boom to Aid the Top Line\n\nThe emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT has brought generative AI into the spotlight, signaling the beginning of a potential AI boom. Generative AI, powered by large language models, can create diverse content types, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. This technology is poised to revolutionize various industries by modernizing workflows.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 47.5% from 2023 to 2030. ChatGPT's adoption by enterprises has demonstrated its utility across sectors such as marketing, customer service, healthcare and more.\n\nHowever, leveraging generative AI requires substantial computational power and expertise, prompting enterprises to upgrade their infrastructure. NVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing capabilities, are well-suited for this task. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the inadequacy of existing data centers for handling AI workloads during NVIDIA's first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs NVIDIA's GPUs find applications in AI models across industries like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing, the demand for its high-powered chips is expected to surge further. NVIDIA anticipates robust revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, reaching $20 billion, driven by increased AI investments in the data center end market.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "7 Untapped Tech Stocks Primed for a Breakout",
        "content": "The Nasdaq is currently sitting at all-time highs. Thus, there’s no shortage of high-priced tech stocks at the moment. While it’s easy to find tech shares that are high priced, finding untapped gems becomes that much harder.\n\nTech stocks have soared over the past year as the artificial intelligence era begins. The Magnificent 7 have been the primary beneficiaries of that boom. Their success has pulled up many other tech stocks. However, there are plenty of hidden gems yet to be discovered along with some better known big name firms.\n\nLet’s take a look at seven tech stocks that appear to be oversold values currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors continue to be bearish about Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock in early 2024. What was once one of the highest flying Chinese tech stocks is now a little more than a contrarian pick. Well, that’s the prevailing market wisdom regarding the e-commerce giant. It’s also wisdom that investors should ignore.\n\nThe Chinese stock market continues to be historically weak. In fact, ETfs Tracking country performance are at Lowe’s last tested in 2011. Investors aren’t particularly keen on Chinese Equity at the moment overall. That said, certain e-commerce competitors of Alibaba, namely PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), look strong primarily due to Temu.\n\nThat has made Alibaba and its shares look even weaker as investors wonder whether it’s time as China’s e-commerce Champion is a thing of the past. That has yet to be determined. What is known at the moment is that Alibaba’s revenues grew by 5% in the most recent quarter.\n\nIt remains the leading cloud firm in China. Those factors have started to sway sentiment with several big names establishing positions in Alibaba. The tide is turning in Alibaba’s favor and now is the time to get on board.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe semiconductor sector is heating up, making Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) one of the tech stocks primed for a breakout.\n\nStory continues\n\nBullishness pervades the sector following news from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) that it expects sales to increase by 20% in 2024. Teradyne produces testing equipment vital to the industry and it should be pulled up because of the news.\n\nAt least, that’s what one would expect. However, Teradyne continues to face a downturn. Its most recent earnings showed revenues declined by 8%. The company continues to forecast weak demand. The reason is simple: market uncertainty. Firms simply don’t have the confidence to assume that the economy will continue to improve. Thus, they are holding back on chip testing equipment purchases for the moment.\n\nWhat then should give investors any reason to establish a contrarian position?  One of the strongest reasons is that Teradyne may have a big opportunity in the US. The company pulled $1 billion worth of equipment out of China due to export controls in 2023. TSM strongly believes that the US chip sector will grow in 2024. Teradyne can make up those losses by pivoting into US strength.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) provides integrated circuits, more specifically, microcontrollers and microprocessors.\n\nBoth types of chips contain CPUs with microcontrollers also including memory and power on one integrated chip. That overly technical explanation aside, Microchip Technology is a stock worth considering.\n\nThe company is extremely profitable with Margins and Returns on assets and Equity that outpace roughly 95% of competitors in the semiconductor sector. Despite the company’s strong performance, it continues to trade more cheaply than 65% of its competitors based on its price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nThe company also released a security oriented chip in late 2023 which makes it more relevant overall. firms everywhere are increasingly concerned about security issues in the AI era. Demand for increased security and connected devices is unsurprisingly increasing because of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe company is looking to rebound in 2024 on weaker sales. It is attempting to do so through share buybacks and dividend payouts which is another reason to consider it.\n\nSTMicroelectronics (STM) STMicroelectronics building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors don’t have to dig deep to find a reason STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) stock remains undervalued.\n\nOne of STMicroelectronics primary revenue generators is the sale of chips to automotive manufacturers and the broader automotive industry. A big reason then for its current troubles is simply that the electric vehicle industry is going through a downturn. EVs require many more chips than do their internal combustion counterparts, thus resulting in trouble for STMicroelectronics.\n\nThere’s a belief that STMicroelectronics is oversold because of skepticism about the EV sector’s recovery. Sales growth is anticipated to continue to slow in 2024 as the sector attempts to move from the early adopter phase into the mass market.\n\nYet, newer chemistries will continue to drive down the costs of battery production. In turn, that could galvanize a resurgence in growth. Whether or not factors become more positive in 2024 remains to be seen.\n\nSTMicroelectronics should keep growing and will break out sooner or later as the tide around electric vehicles shifts again.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock increased in price dramatically following news that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has invested in the firm.\n\nNvidia disclosed that it has invested $3.7 million in the company which engages in conversational AI development. It was among the smaller investments Nvidia made with a $76 million investment in a biotech firm and a $147.3 million investment in Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nDespite its relatively small size, the disclosure of the investment served to raise SoundHound AI’s share price by more than 60%.\n\nThe best time to have been invested in SoundHound AI was clearly prior to the disclosure of the news. Yet, it continues to be a sound investment and is among the leading names in conversational AI. Nvidia’s investment in SoundHound AI strongly suggests that it believes the firm is the leading company in the emergent space.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) A Cisco (CSCO) sign outside of a building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)Is another very well known Tech stock to investors. Thus, it’s hard to characterize it as being untapped. further, the company is going through a restructuring that will result in headcount declining by 5%.\n\nThe company is dealing with a glut of inventory at the companies it serves. It will take time for those buyers to work through inventory, which will slow down sales at the company. That news sets the stage for a few positive things to happen.\n\nMany companies have moved higher because of restructuring over the past year. It is entirely possible that the markets receive the news positively. Labor costs are the highest expense for firms and in that regard, Cisco Systems just improved.\n\nAnother reason to buy Cisco Systems now is the potential for higher dividend yields if shares keep falling. With a dividend yield of over 3%, it’s a strong income choice among tech stocks. The bargain is improving, another reason to consider Cisco Systems now.\n\nGlobal Payments (GPN) Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) Is a fintech stock with momentum on its side. The Atlanta-based company just released earnings which were overall quite positive.\n\nRevenues increased by 8%, reaching $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings increased by 50% during the same period and the company’s operating margin increased by 2.4%. Clearly there’s a lot to like. The strong results are one of the primary reasons that share prices have increased from $127 to $137 year to date.\n\nCFO Josh Whipple noted that the company’s outlook for 2024 continues to foresee strong momentum though it has been tempered by recent economic uncertainty. That was a nod to headline inflation numbers which continue to confound economists.\n\nRegardless, the fintech opportunity continues to be strong as the traditional finance and banking sector further digitizes in 2024 and beyond. Income investors will also appreciate the fact that Global Payments includes a dividend. That dividend yields a modest 0.75% that will add up over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia's surging growth may still disappoint some investors",
        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is set to post a more than three-fold surge in its fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, the same as in the previous quarter, as demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence outstrips supply.\n\nBut even that remarkable growth may disappoint some investors who have become accustomed to Nvidia blasting past analyst expectations, which has led to a bull run in its stock since the beginning of 2023.\n\nNvidia recently left Amazon.com behind to become the fourth most valuable U.S. company, and is now head-to-head with Alphabet for the No. 3 spot. The chipmaker's stock has already surged nearly 50% so far this year.\n\nThat rally could ease if Nvidia warns again that U.S. curbs on selling its chips to China are hurting its business and visibility into long-term prospects, and if it is unable to sort out supply shortages at its chip contractor TSMC.\n\nIn response to the newest round of U.S. export rules, Nvidia has come up with new products for the Chinese market, but there is a risk that those chips will also be banned like its first round of China market chips.\n\n\"There's an understanding that China is going to go its own way,\" said Angus Shillington, a portfolio manager at wealth manager VanEck, referring to the country's efforts to make its own chips. VanEck's Semiconductor ETF held more than $151 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Jan. 31.\n\nChina accounted for more than a fifth of Nvidia's revenue in the third quarter.\n\nUltimately though, red-hot demand for Nvidia's graphic processing units - which are powering an AI upgrade at massive datacenters around the world - could trump all concerns.\n\n\"Given the hot demand situation, Nvidia should comfortably be able to replace China demand with other governments as well as large enterprises,\" Tejas Dessai, an analyst at exchange traded fund (ETF) provider Global X told Reuters. Global X's Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF held roughly $500 million worth of Nvidia stock as of Feb. 13.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also likely to forecast on Wednesday another 200% year-over-year increase in revenue for its first quarter ending April, according to LSEG data.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts said in a note they expect Nvidia to top that expectation by 25%, thanks to aggressive orders, and Goldman Sachs said it expects major supplier TSMC to increase chip packaging capacity through the first half of the year.\n\nDemand for advanced packaging was very strong and TSMC couldn't offer enough capacity to support customers, a bottleneck that would continue into next year, the Taiwanese company said in January. It is planning to invest nearly $2.87 billion in a plant, as it looks to double its packaging capacity.\n\n\"The reason why (Nvidia) can't beat (estimates) by more is the capacity needs. That is what's holding them back. Otherwise there could have been a larger beat,\" said Inge Heydorn, a partner at investment firm G.P. Bullhound, which holds Nvidia shares.\n\nLast May, Nvidia stunned investors by forecasting revenue for the May-July period nearly 54% above analysts' expectations, igniting a rally in AI-facing stocks. Since then, the company's forecasts have surprised analysts, but to a smaller degree.\n\nVanEck's Shillington said he does not expect that magnitude of a surprise, and that Nvidia would be foolish to rely on China demand.\n\nFor the first three quarters of 2023, Nvidia had reported quarterly revenue that beat analysts' estimates by between 10% and 20%.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Thursday?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom will get another big test this week.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the chipmaker that has become the flag-bearer for the generative AI revolution, will report fourth-quarter earnings after hours on Wednesday, and you can bet Wall Street will be standing by with rapt attention.\n\nAfter all, Nvidia is now up nearly 400% since the start of 2023 and has gained 46% this year alone as its hardware has helped lead the artificial intelligence charge after ChatGPT was launched. Nvidia recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-most valuable U.S. company with a market cap of $1.8 trillion, behind only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nNvidia has become the bellwether for the AI boom, so it's only natural to speculate about its upcoming earnings report. Is it the right move to buy the AI stock before its fourth-quarter numbers come out? Let's take a look at the available evidence to see the best decision. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat to expect from Nvidia on Wednesday\n\nNvidia has seen extraordinary demand for its GPUs, accelerators, and other chips that are well suited to run the kind of AI models that make programs like ChatGPT work, and Wall Street has had trouble keeping up with the surge in demand for Nvidia's products.\n\nThe chip titan has breezed past Wall Street estimates and typically gives guidance well ahead of the consensus. Wall Street estimates have steadily floated higher for Nvidia in recent months.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect revenue to skyrocket 237% to $20.4 billion, and see earnings per share jumping from $0.88 to $4.56.\n\nThose are lofty expectations, but they aren't unwarranted. In its third quarter, Nvidia's revenue soared by 206% to $18.1 billion, and it forecast revenue of around $20 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nNvidia's partners have smashed estimates\n\nThere's also evidence that the AI boom is still picking up speed based on reports from some of Nvidia's partners.\n\nArm (NASDAQ: ARM) shares soared after it showed off accelerating revenue growth in its recent earnings report and touted a surge in AI-related demand. Arm licenses its CPU technology to Nvidia, and Arm designs are featured in Nvidia products like the Grace Hopper H200 Superchip, which is a more advanced version of the hugely popular H100 GPU that's been at the center of the AI boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) shares have gone parabolic since the company reported preliminary results in January that were well ahead of expectations as its revenue doubled in the quarter. The company makes high-density servers and storage solutions that have been in high demand for their AI capabilities, and they run on Nvidia GPUs. Supermicro stock has surged 182% year to date and is up nearly 900% since the start of 2023.\n\nBoth of those earnings reports would bode well for Nvidia's update because Arm, Supermicro, and Nvidia are all benefiting from the same trends.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia now or wait until after earnings?\n\nIf you're buying a stock, it's best to plan to hold it for at least a year, which offers tax benefits and the advantage of smoothing out the volatility inherent in the stock market.\n\nAs Benjamin Graham said, \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it's a weighing machine.\" It's easier to be right on a stock's \"weight\" than its popularity, which helps give an advantage to long-term investors.\n\nIt's impossible to know for certain whether Nvidia will go up or down on its earnings report. But if you're buying the stock, you should be buying it because you believe it has sustainable competitive advantages that will enable it to continue to dominate the market for GPUs and AI chips, and use that as leverage to enter new markets such as PCs, which it recently announced plans to do.\n\nThere's no shortage of euphoria for Nvidia or other stocks with AI exposure, and several small-cap stocks recently skyrocketed when Nvidia revealed that it had taken small stakes in those companies.\n\nHowever, the recent surges from Arm and Supermicro indicate the market still seems to be underestimating the potential for AI hardware stocks like Nvidia. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the stock is more likely to go up than down on the earnings report, and the options market is betting on that as well.\n\nBeyond earnings, Nvidia's competitive advantages seem to be strengthening, and demand for AI applications is likely to expand for the next several years, which will drive demand for its chips.\n\nEven after its monster rally, the stock looks like a smart long-term buy heading into earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia dethrones Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock",
        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia is replacing Tesla as Wall Street's most traded stock, adding to its prominence after becoming the third-most valuable U.S. company and showing more evidence of how central AI-related bets have become to investors.\n\nNvidia's outsized representation in day-to-day stock trading could leave investors more vulnerable should the chipmaker's revenue growth fail to meet investors' high expectations and puncture a Wall Street rally that has been fueled by euphoria about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California chipmaker's quarterly report on Wednesday will be one of Wall Street's most watched events of the week. Some strategists believe anything short of a blowout report could reverse a rally that has sent Nvidia's stock soaring 47% in 2024.\n\nAbout $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands daily on average over the past 30 sessions, pulling ahead of Elon Musk's electric car maker, which averaged $22 billion per day over the same period.\n\nTesla since 2020 had dominated daily U.S. stock trading, according to LSEG data, with turnover -- a stock's share price multiplied by the number of shares exchanged -- peaking above $35 billion several times in recent years.\n\nOn Friday, combined trading in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, another company benefiting from the boom in AI, accounted for over 40% of all turnover of the 10 most traded U.S. stocks, including Tesla, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n\"There's an argument here that this is the dawn of a new era of trading, like the dawn of the internet, with Nvidia in the pole position,\" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading in Ontario, Canada.\n\nBut Dick also warned that sky-high turnover in AI-related stocks suggests retail investors and algorithmic traders are driving share prices higher based on momentum rather than fundamentals, such as expectations of future revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro, which sells AI-related server components to Nvidia, has seen its value more than triple to $45 billion so far in 2024. It tumbled 20% from record highs on Friday after Wells Fargo started covering the stock with an equal weight rating, saying its valuation already discounts \"solid upside\".\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, and last week its market capitalization eclipsed, separately, Amazon's and Alphabet's to make it Wall Street's third-most valuable company, behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia's stock market value has surged to $1.8 trillion from $540 billion a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's stock has tumbled 20% so far in 2024 as it struggles with tepid demand for its electric cars and growing competition.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",

Walmart's shares were up 1.5% before the bell.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Discover Financial Services surged 11.1% on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's plans to acquire the U.S. credit card issuer in a $35.3 billion deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are also awaiting the release of minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting as well as remarks from a slew of central bank officials later this week. The economic data calendar this week is light.\n\nAt 5:27 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 73 points, or 0.19%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 18.75 points, or 0.37%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 108.75 points, or 0.61%.\n\nShares of Intel added 4.2% following a report on Friday that the Biden administration is in talks to award more than $10 billion in subsidies to the semiconductor firm.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 20, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CleanSpark CLSK, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA and Iris Energy IREN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Crypto Stocks Riding the Hot Bitcoin Rally This Year\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has reclaimed its market cap to more than $1 trillion for the first time in two years. The crypto has surged past $52,000, gaining nearly 25% so far this year on the back of a fresh wave of investors’ interest in tokens.\n\nWith the digital asset rally, cryptocurrency stocks also surged. We have presented five top-performing stocks that have been leading the rally in the cryptocurrency space this year. These are CleanSpark, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Marathon Digital Holdings and Iris Energy.\n\nInside the Surge in Bitcoin\n\nThe launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has been acting as the major catalyst for the bitcoin surge as it has made it easier for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the asset, thereby underscoring growth of cryptocurrency in mainstream investment platforms.\n\nIn a milestone, data from CryptoQuant revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their inception on Jan 10 this year, reflecting a strong investor interest. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which previously dampened market sentiment, have significantly reduced, further fueling the upward trajectory. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs are a game changer for cryptocurrency investors.\n\nARK Invest, renowned for its optimistic outlook, envisions Bitcoin as a successor to gold as a secure asset, forecasting continued value growth, driven by its increasing integration into the financial ecosystem. It argues that Bitcoin's resilience to economic uncertainties like inflation and interest rate hikes positions it favorably in the current economic environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe anticipation of bitcoin's upcoming halving event in April is also influencing the cryptocurrency market. Halving, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically been seen as a catalyst for bitcoin's price. Moreover, the Lunar New Year holidays are contributing to a generally positive sentiment toward bitcoin, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nCleanSpark is engaged in the mining of cryptocurrencies. It owns and operates data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. The stock has gained about 56% this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 81.4% for the fiscal year ending September 2024.\n\nCLSK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped about 47% this year. It has an estimated growth of 64.4% for the fiscal year ending January 2025.\n\nNvidia has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A at present.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices offers the industry’s broadest portfolio of leadership high-performance and adaptive processor technologies.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Can Be the Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, Wall Street has had no shortage of next-big-thing trends that have captivated investors. At the moment, nothing is garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI, which involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks normally overseen by humans, has application across almost every sector and industry. This is likely why the analysts at PwC believe AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution\n\nOver the past year, megacap Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the charge among artificial intelligence stocks. It's become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains of high-compute data centers that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.\n\nSince 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have nearly quintupled in value, with the company closing in on $1.5 trillion in added market cap, all thanks to AI. With enterprise demand particularly high for the company's AI-accelerated chips and supply still short, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power, which has driven most of its sales increase.\n\nBut with Nvidia shares closing at $726 last week, the prospect of a stock split may begin to look all the more enticing.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Nvidia would be looking at its second forward split in the past three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only high-flying AI or AI-related stock that appears primed for a potential stock split. What follows are three AI companies that could beat this GPU juggernaut to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could beat Nvidia to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is none other than social media juggernaut Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta has never conducted a stock split, but its share price climbed to near $490 this past week.\n\nMeta is using AI in a variety of ways across its various products. In addition to helping with search and weeding out noncompliant posts made on its social media platforms, it's leaning heavily on generative AI to help businesses tailor their ads to users.\n\nMany of the investments Meta is making in AI and virtual/augmented reality probably won't result in a sizable increase in sales for years. In the meantime, it continues to generate almost 98% of its revenue from advertising. The company's social media real estate, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads, is tops in the world, with nearly 4 billion collective monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Meta should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nSomething else to note about Meta Platforms is that it's a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year, and it closed out 2023 with over $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This treasure chest is what allows CEO Mark Zuckerberg the luxury of taking risks, which includes the development of Meta's own AI chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nA second AI-fueled company that can become Wall Street's next stock-split stock well ahead of Nvidia is server and storage-solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Like Meta Platforms, Super Micro has never conducted a stock split. However, with its stock briefly surpassing $1,000 per share last week, a forward split is probably in consideration.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's more-than-doubling in sales this year is a function of its highly customizable and energy-efficient rack-scale servers being in high demand. It's also a reflection of the company relying on Nvidia's AI-powered GPUs in its products. Businesses wanting to harness AI to expand their long-term growth potential and reach are increasingly turning to Super Micro.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if Super Micro Computer can hold onto its nearly exponential returns over the past couple of weeks. Shares ended the previous week up 183% on a year-to-date basis, and are up 878% since the start of 2023. Historically, every next-big-thing investment over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies or innovations. AI will likely share this fate.\n\nThe other challenge for Super Micro is going to be whether or not it can maximize demand for its rack-scale solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro relies on Nvidia's GPUs, it's at the mercy of its suppliers. But if Super Micro can somehow meet or surpass Wall Street's already lofty growth expectations, a stock split could well be in the cards.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that could leapfrog Nvidia and become one of Wall Street's next stock-split stocks is semiconductor giant Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Before Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016 and kept its name, Broadcom had completed three splits. But Avago had never split its stock. As of Feb. 16, a single share of Broadcom was setting shareholders back a whopping $1,245.\n\nBroadcom is approaching AI inclusion a couple of ways. It's added AI features to its Trident networking processors, and in April 2023 introduced its Jericho3-AI chip for AI networks. Jericho3 is integral for high-performance data centers in that it's designed to connect up to 32,000 GPUs. In short, it's designed to handle increasingly faster workloads in enterprise data centers.\n\nOne factor that's definitely worked in Broadcom's favor is its juicy backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan failed to provide an update on Broadcom's backlog in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ends in late September), the company totaled a record backlog of $31 billion in mid-2022. Wall Street and investors love large backlogs, because it typically leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.\n\nBut something investors should keep in mind is that Broadcom is generating a significant percentage of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While this segment should continue to deliver modest growth and plenty of cash flow for Broadcom, it could, ultimately, hold back the company's overall growth rate given how large of a role it plays in net sales.\n\nWith one of the highest nominal-dollar share prices on Wall Street, Broadcom is a logical candidate to split its stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock Going to $1,200? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most remarkable stocks since the hype around artificial intelligence (AI) took the market by storm. Since the beginning of last year, shares of the advanced semiconductor company are up nearly 400%.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst thinks there's still plenty of upside for Nvidia, too. Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital has initiated coverage with a buy rating and $1,200 price target. That's the highest of all analysts covering the stock, and it represents a 65% gain from where shares trade as of this writing.\n\nAnd remember Nvidia was trading below $120 per share as recently as Oct. 2022.\n\nWhat makes a stock jump fivefold in just over a year?\n\nThe explosion in spending on high-end AI chips that boost computing power hasn't just been a surprise to analysts and investors but to the company itself.\n\nIn May 2023, Nvidia beat its fiscal Q1 revenue guidance by about $700 million. But that was just the beginning: Over the next two quarters, actual revenue exceeded management's guidance by at least $2 billion each time.\n\nDemand for AI chips has Nvidia's data center business growing faster than the company itself can keep up with. All eyes will be on the fiscal 2024 year-end report due Feb. 21 to see if the company once again beats what's already a record $20 billion quarterly revenue outlook.\n\nThe highest price target on Wall Street\n\nLoop Capital thinks the company will continue to surprise investors as Nvidia sells all of the advanced chips it can make for several more years. The firm's $1,200 price target implies a trailing-12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 158.\n\nBut align Loop's forward-looking price target and Nvidia's earnings estimates, and that valuation drops quickly. Analysts expect the company to report $20.41 in earnings per share in fiscal 2025, giving the company a forward P/E ratio of 59. That's still a premium to the market, but it's a much more reasonable price tag for long-term investors who want a piece of this AI leader.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot-Pole",
        "content": "It is abundantly clear that we are at the beginning of an artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. There's a very good chance that AI will have as large an impact on our future as the industrial revolution or widespread adoption of the internet did.\n\nAs machines get smarter and we are better able to automate tasks that either used to be impossible or required major human intervention, there's no telling what new capabilities will arise. Even with that reality, there's one artificial intelligence stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole right now. That stock is actually one that has been among the biggest winners of the AI revolution so far, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images\n\nHave I lost my mind?\n\nTo be clear -- it is obvious that NVIDIA has an incredible early mover advantage when it comes to AI hardware today. It's also clear that Nvidia is not resting on its laurels when it comes to designing and delivering next-generation AI-related hardware .\n\nThe challenge that's keeping me away from Nvidia's shares today has nothing to do with its business or its prospects, it's the company's valuation. Nvidia's shares are trading at a level that requires it to deliver spectacular growth for years to come, just to justify the price it already commands in the market.\n\nIn my mind, the best time to have bought Nvidia would have been that brief window between the cryptocurrency bust and the start of the AI boom. At that point, around September of 2022 , Nvidia's shares were trading based on its prospects as a key hardware designer, rather than as the core picks-and-shovels play of the AI revolution.\n\nCan Nvidia continue to thrive? Yes.\n\nWill its operations continue to grow as AI gets more embedded in our everyday lives and jobs? Probably.\n\nWill today's new investors be rewarded for the risks they're taking by putting their money in Nvidia's shares? Well, that's where I'm having trouble justifying a purchase.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia may be \"the one that got away\"\n\nFor a sense of why I'm nervous, analysts expect Nvidia to earn about $20 per share in 2025, after an estimated $11.50 per share in 2024. Overall, those same analysts are expecting the company's earnings to nearly double each year for the next five years.\n\nIf the company delivers earnings growth in line with those prospects over the next few years, then its recent market price above $725 per share may be justified. Yet to deliver that kind of consistent earnings growth over that long a period of time, Nvidia will need to continue to pump out more and more hardware, at higher and higher margins.\n\nOn top of that, the market generally tries to be forward-looking when valuing a company. So it's not enough for Nvidia to simply grow like wildfire over the next several years to justify its current market capitalization. It then needs to at least maintain those higher earnings over time to keep its stock price from falling.\n\nIf you take a step back away from the AI-related hope, Nvidia has a history of being cyclical. Even if Nvidia benefits from the build out of AI-related infrastructure, the company would face a natural slowdown when that growth turns into maintenance after that infrastructure is built.\n\nAnd of course, competition won't sit there and let Nvidia own the entire global AI computing infrastructure. Even if that competition isn't as good as Nvidia in the AI space, it just has to be good enough to provide an alternative for its customers. That would put a dent in Nvidia's margins to make it that much harder for Nvidia to see the massive, sustained profit growth that analysts are already expecting from it.\n\nPut all those factors together, and Nvidia may very well turn out to be the stock that got away from me. At this point, I'm willing to watch it from the sidelines and wish its shareholders the best.\n\nTread carefully if you choose to invest\n\nOf course, as someone who follows a value-focused investing strategy, I have a tendency to be a bit late to the investing party when it comes to brand new, world-changing trends. While it means I rarely participate in the booms from those innovative trends, it also means that I am frequently in a reasonable spot to ride out the busts that frequently follow.\n\nOn one hand, today's investors in Nvidia may be rewarded for buying its shares early enough in the growth stage of the AI revolution. On the other hand, they may find themselves bag holders owning near the peak of a cyclical high point. If the outcome were knowable for certain, there would never be massive moves in the market when companies post surprise changes in earnings or guidance.\n\nWith that uncertainty the only thing that's truly clear when it comes to Nvidia's share price, investors should tread carefully. If things do end up poorly for its shares (even if the business continues to thrive), you don't want so much at risk that you'll wind up financially devastated.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia’s earnings announcement may be the most anticipated event of the week. (Dado Ruvic / reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nAI darling Nvidia is set to report its earnings on Wednesday and investors have not held back on bullish expectations. Buy-side estimates for Nvidia stand 9% above consensus, at $21.7bn (£17.2bn) for the fourth quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker's lead in AI has propelled it to the third-highest market cap in the world, only trailing Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nConsensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of $20.36bn. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\n\nRead more: Barclays to return £10bn to shareholders despite profit drop\n\nNvidia stock price is up 46.6% so far in 2024, adding to its 238% gain in 2023.\n\nWalmart (WMT)\n\nAmerica's biggest retailer is set to report its fourth quarter results this Tuesday before the US opening bell.\n\nUS same-store sales are expected to jump 3.2%, based on Bloomberg consensus data, a sharp drop from the 8.8% growth it clocked this time last year.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAs the nation’s largest retailer and private employer, Walmart often serves as a barometer for how consumers feel about their finances and how they are managing challenges like elevated grocery prices.\n\nWall Street expects Walmart to earn $1.65 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) on a record $169.26bn in sales for the quarter ending in January. This would amount to a 4% increase in revenue but a slight dip from the year prior’s quarter of $1.71 in adjusted EPS.\n\nHome Depot (HD)\n\nThe home improvement retail company was trading near two-year highs ahead of releasing its fourth-quarter earnings this Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are bracing themselves for what would be Home Depot’s first annual sales drop since 2009.\n\nAnalysts expect Home Depot’s revenue will fall by 3% to $34.6bn in its fiscal fourth quarter. Yearly revenue is also expected to decline by the same amount. Same-store sales are seen falling 3.2%.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as China cuts key interest rate\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be interested in Home Depot's comments on consumer behaviour and how consumers are reacting to high levels of inflation.\n\nIHG (IHG.L) Carly Rae Jepsen performs at the IHG Hotels & Resorts® Official Lollapalooza Pre-Party in 2023.

        "title": "Walmart, Amazon, Microsoft, Target and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 20, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN, Target TGT, Microsoft MSFT and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nRetail Earnings Loom: What's In Store?\n\nWalmart shares were down in response to the last quarterly release on November 16th following modestly underwhelming guidance, but the analyst commentary about the report was generally favorable. The analysts’ positive take on the quarterly results can also be gauged from their earnings estimates for the following periods, which have increased slightly since then.\n\nWalmart shares remained under pressure for roughly three weeks following the mid-November 2023 quarterly report, during which the stock lost more than -10% of its value. The stock has made an impressive rebound since then and is currently trading at its 52-week high, outperforming the market since the start of January 2024 (+8.9% vs. +5.3%).\n\nIt will be interesting to see if this performance momentum can be sustained following fresh quarterly results on Tuesday, February 20th. We wouldn’t be surprised by a sell-the-news type of reaction as we saw following the November 2023 release.\n\nThe expectation is that the company will bring in $1.65 per share in earnings on $170.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -3.5% and +4%, respectively. Please note that the $1.65 per share estimate is up from $1.63 per share a few days back.\n\nTarget isn’t expected to report quarterly results till March 5th, though Home Depot is also on deck to report results Tuesday morning along with Walmart. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart, Home Depot, and Target relative to the S&P 500 index.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 17 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for these 17 retailers that have reported are up +72.4% from the same period last year on +10.7% higher revenues, with 88.2% beating EPS estimates and 58.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe online players and restaurant operators easily beat EPS estimates but have struggled to beat top-line estimates.\n\nConcerning the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 17 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q4 earnings were up +410.9% on +13.9% higher revenues, beating top and bottom-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a massive boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nWe have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution. One can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q4 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nStandout Features of the Q4 Earnings Season\n\nThe overall picture that emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration in the growth momentum.Earnings aren’t great, but no one expected corporate profitability to be strong. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.\n\nWith quarterly results from more than 79% of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 16th, here are the five key features that these quarterly results have confirmed.\n\nFirst, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have seen in recent quarters.\n\nThe absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.\n\nFor the 396 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 16th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.1% and +3.4% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 78.8% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 64.4% have beaten revenue estimates.\n\nSecond, companies are making good progress on the margins front.\n\nThe year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.\n\nAt the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance, and others.\n\nOn the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Medical, Autos, Energy, and Transportation sectors.\n\nThird, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.\n\nFor the 79.4% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +20.5% on +6.1% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 71.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nLooking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.7% from the same period last year on +8.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.\n\nPlease remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector but rather the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.6% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.8% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nThis means that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a very big impact on the aggregate picture, both negatively and positively. The sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historically positive growth role.\n\nPlease note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.1% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.\n\nFourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nEach of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.\n\nNvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.8% on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.\n\nPlease note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory if not for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.\n\nFive, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.\n\nEstimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Results Paint a Positive Earnings Picture\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "What To Expect From Nvidia’s (NVDA) Q4 Earnings\n\nLeading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow after the bell. Here's what to look for.\n\nLast quarter Nvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion, up 206% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 12.5%. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with a significant improvement in its gross margin and an impressive beat of analysts' EPS estimates.\n\nIs Nvidia buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to grow 239% year on year to $20.54 billion, improving on the 20.8% year-over-year decline in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.63 per share. Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing seven upward revisions over the last thirty days. The company has a history of exceeding Wall St's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years on average by 6.5%.\n\nLooking at Nvidia's peers in the processors and graphics chips segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. SMART's revenues decreased 30% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 0.3% and Lattice Semiconductor reported revenue decline of 3% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 3.3%. SMART traded up 8.2% on the results, and Lattice Semiconductor was down 12.3%.\n\nRead our full analysis of SMART's results here and Lattice Semiconductor's results here.\n\nInvestors in the processors and graphics chips segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks flat on average over the last month. Nvidia is up 21.9% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $741.6, compared to share price of $727.1.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "(Updates with closing prices, adds additional analyst comment in final paragraphs)\n\nBy Kevin Buckland\n\nTOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Japan's benchmark stock index struggled for traction on Tuesday, remaining stuck this week some 1% below the all-time peak set over three decades ago, with traders wary ahead of Nvidia earnings that could test the chip sector's AI euphoria.\n\nChina's unexpectedly large rate cut gave Japanese stocks a boost in the morning session, but it proved to be short-lived, and the Nikkei share average ended the day down 0.28% at 38,363.61.\n\nThe Nikkei is on the cusp of breaking its all-time high of 38,957.44, set on the final trading day of 1989 at the peak of Japan's bubble economy. On Friday, the benchmark index pushed as high as 38,865.06 before pulling back into the close.\n\nJapan's chip-sector giants have been a driving force of the Nikkei's nearly 15% surge this year, handily outperforming major peers, including the U.S. S&P 500 and tech-focused Nasdaq Composite, which have gained about 5% each.\n\nChip-testing equipment maker Advantest, for example, which counts Nvidia among its customers, has soared 40% in 2024, despite sagging 1% on Tuesday.\n\nTech was a mixed bag overall, with Advantest-peer Lasertec sliding 1.7% and chip-making equipment giant Tokyo Electron slipping 0.4%, while chip maker Renesas climbed 2.1%. AI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group lost 0.1% after earlier gaining as much as 2.5%.\n\nNvidia reports financial results on Wednesday.\n\n\"With Nvidia's earnings announcement looming, it's extremely difficult for investors to move,\" said Kazuo Kamitani, an equities strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\n\"For Nvidia of course, and for Japanese stocks as well, there's some feeling of overheating, so a dip would be natural, but with expectations so extremely high, it's not going to decline so easily.\"\n\nA measure of momentum called the relative strength index (RSI) sits at 73.9 for the Nikkei, and has been above the 70 line signalling overbought conditions for more than a week.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the Nikkei volatility index has retreated sharply from the one-month high reached on Friday.\n\n\"It's just a matter of time for the Nikkei to break the record high given the change in the trend of the Japanese economy,\" with wages rising, and companies able to pass on costs through price increases, said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management.\n\n\"I think there is a good chance that the Nikkei could break the record in coming weeks, but it depends on how U.S. equities behave.\" (Reporting by Kevin Buckland Editing By Shri Navaratnam)",

        "content": "The near- and medium-term outlooks for growth stocks have greatly improved in recent weeks. That’s because it appears that the Street has, at long last, realized that relatively small increases in interest rates don’t necessarily portend doom for all growth names. Providing evidence for this assertion, the interest on the ten-year Treasury Note had climbed to 4.28% as of Feb. 16 from 4% at the beginning of the month. Yet the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap firms advanced to 2,032 from 1,983 during the same period.\n\nEarlier in the bull market, when investors were much more wedded to the ridiculous notion that interest rates were nearly 100% determinative of the fate of almost all growth stocks, such a divergence could not have occurred. Of course, the Federal Reserve’s apparent determination to cut rates later this year is also piquing the Street’s interest in growth stocks. In any event, here are three growth names to buy to exploit the Street’s new-found rationality.\n\nSchrodinger (SDGR) Image of white paper airplanes on horizontal trajectory with one red paper airplane rising upward, symbolizing growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pasuwan\n\nSchrodinger (NASDAQ:SDGR), which uses artificial intelligence to speed up the drug-discovery process, appears to have begun to rally thanks to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) decision to increase its investment in a similar firm.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, “NVDA raised its stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) to $76 million from $50 million,” as I noted in a previous article. Like SDGR, RXRX uses AI to shorten the notoriously arduous process of developing pharmaceuticals.\n\nSince Nvidia’s new purchases of RXRX stock were disclosed on Feb. 14, SDGR stock has rallied 17%.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that the forward price-sales ratio of SDGR is 8.4, while that of RXRX is about 48 times. SDGR has collaboration deals with at least six large drug makers, while Recursion only deals with two major drug makers.\n\nGiven these points, SDGR has much more room to advance than RXRX over the longer term.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel stock should get a boost from Bloomberg’s recent report that it’s in talks to obtain over $10 billion of subsidies from the U.S. to build chip factories here.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm is slated to “provide updates” on its nascent chip-making business on Feb. 21. At the event, it will probably provide information about new customers to boost INTC stock.\n\nMeanwhile, as noted last month, the firm’s Gaudi 2 AI chips are competitive with Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) top AI chip, the H100, in multiple categories. INTC’s backlog of orders for these chips reached $2 billion as of the end of last year, while it’s planning to introduce a new product version later this year with a quadrupling of processing power and a doubling of networking bandwidth.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25 as its revenue climbed 11% versus the same period a year earlier while its bottom line soared 23% to $1.93 billion.\n\nAlso notable is that the credit card network predicts revenue will increase 9% to 11% this year, while its earnings per share will rise to $12.65 to $13.15 from $11.21 in 2023.\n\nThe firm is getting a big boost from the tremendous prosperity enjoyed by the wealthiest 10% of Americans over the last several years. AXP’s cards tend to cater to well-off consumers. As the bull market continues, upper-income Americans, who own most of the nation’s stocks, will likely increase their spending due to the well-known “wealth effect” on expenditures. That phenomenon should provide the company with another significant lift.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in SDGR and INTC, while his wife held long positions of SDGR, INTC and AXP.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market This Week",
        "content": "During the week of February 12-16, we talked about three stocks to watch, Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), to gain insights into broader market trends and potentially benefit. As the earnings season peaks, we explore three stocks to buy this week, and we explain the reasons behind it.\n\nThe relatively heavy economic data published last week, including the U.S. CPI and Retail Sales figures, has added market volatility. It also seemed that the U.S. economy would avoid a recession, a positive catalyst for those looking for stocks to buy this week. Both events bolstered investor sentiment despite rising bond yields.\r\n\r\nLast week also caught the market somewhat broadening out beyond its largest constituents. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained strong momentum, implying overall optimism. This provided another sign for those risk-on investors looking for stocks to buy in the small-cap space.\r\n\r\nThe February 19 – 23 earnings calendar may be fairly light, leaving direction in the hands of the remainder of corporate earnings reports. A primary focus for those scouting stocks to buy will be tech giant Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) widely anticipated earnings release. Investors may secure some of their profits ahead or post-announcement, inducing downward pressure on its stock price. However, a solid quarterly report would probably help lift the broader market.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Nvidia, where earnings could prompt upward or downward momentum, a few other stocks to buy could present interesting opportunities. Solid earnings may help offset potential increased volatility should the last of the Magnificent 7 fail to catalyze further upside across markets.​\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the prominent coffee company, could be one of the stocks to buy this week. The company presents an interesting investment opportunity during a week anticipated to focus substantially on tech news. Despite the company’s earnings results at the beginning of February missing analyst estimates, investors initially helped push the stock price higher. Yet, during the subsequent period following the release, its stock price declined below the level it stood at during the announcement. However, SBUX’s retracement has not coincided with any adjustment to its underlying fundamentals.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported increased profits of 20% year-on-year (YOY) and maintained a generous dividend policy. This suggests its stock price may stabilise as investors refocus beyond the immediate post-earnings reaction.\r\n\r\nStarbucks currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.9x, below the 27.2x of the S&P 500 Index. Analysts have established an average price target of $107.15, representing a 15% potential upside.​\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) stocks to buy, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) could be one of the more intriguing opportunities this week as optimism in the tech sector remains buoyant. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday. Its stock price has risen in anticipation of the earnings release, and if the optimism continues, it could still be one of the stocks to buy not just for this week but also the following.\r\n\r\nDespite the bottom line growing some 66% in the previous quarter, the market reacted negatively to disappointing forward revenue guidance. Therefore, guidance will likely be a key focus this time around. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 24% to $1.30, with revenues increasing 19% to $1.97 billion. Notably, Palo Alto has a track record of exceeding analyst estimates by an average of 20% or more.\n\nLennar (LEN) Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screen\n\nSource: madamF via Shutterstock\n\nHomebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN) could be the last of the stocks to buy this week after seeing its share price drop in the wake of the CPI data released last week. It suggested that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may maintain higher interest rates and, therefore, mortgage prices would increase. However, with easing yields, its stock price could stage a rebound.\n\nAn even bigger catalyst for the construction company may be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) upcoming earnings report at the end of the week. This is because Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, has been accumulating homebuilder stock lately, including a $21.4 million stake in Lennar. While a small portion of his overall investment portfolio, the renowned investor’s interest in the company implies it may have growth potential as the U.S. continues grappling with a sizable housing deficit of 3.1 million units.\r\n\r\nLennar currently trades at a P/E ratio of just 10.9x while holding a $6.3 billion cash reserve to invest in new opportunities. The company increased its cash holdings by $1.7 billion since last year, which makes it an even more compelling stock to buy this week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are a shining example of potential. They exist in the fast-paced world of finance. Here, data and insight are the driving forces behind the future. Today, we explore this possibility via AI stock forecasts. There is a particular emphasis on one of the most powerful AI models. This journey started with a request to ChatGPT for stock recommendations. It resulted in ChatGPT stock predictions that rethink investing methods.\n\nWhen it comes to stock market research, the incorporation of AI is revolutionary. It takes accuracy and foresight to a new level. We are investigating choices made by this digital oracle. We realize we are at the intersection of technology and finance.\n\nHere, the future of investment is being rewritten. Come along as we investigate the consequences of these forecasts. We will also explore the role of AI in the future of the financial environment. ChatGPT stock predictions play a crucial role in this exploration. As a result, join us on this journey as we dig deeper into these ChatGPT stock predictions so that you can decide whether they are a good fit for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is leading the charge in transforming AI with its latest developments. The organization is a big player in the AI field. It has been deemed so because of the company’s GPU technology, which is a requirement for AI and machine learning operations. However, Nvidia is expanding its AI solutions to the software and cloud services areas as well. Hence, AI has become more affordable for companies operating in different industries. The company is in a constant process of innovation in AI, gaming and self-driving cars, which translates into tremendous growth.\n\nThe company recently showcased AI Workbench tools and novel graphics processing units (GPUs) based on Tensor Cores. These innovations focus on simplifying the creation of generative AI models on desktops and laptops. They prioritize efficiency and tackle the typical memory and performance constraints of PCs. Additionally, the forthcoming AI Workbench aims to provide effortless access to crucial AI resources. That will encourage collaboration and enhance flexibility in project management.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has marked a significant advancement in AI infrastructure with its DGX GH200 AI supercomputer. The product integrates the Nvidia NVLink Switch System with a Grace Hopper Superchip for the first time, promising unparalleled NVLink bandwidth to meet the complex needs of AI research. Interestingly, major IT companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google Cloud are exploring their potential for generative AI activities. Nvidia is also improving the performance of data centers with Grace’s Superchip CPU and the H100 chip. These technologies will greatly reduce the time needed to train ML models, and the world of AI might totally turn upside down. That kind of strategic move places Nvidia among the top competitors in the data center and cloud computing industries.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft is deliberately establishing itself as a leader in the AI industry, indicating a substantial shift toward incorporating AI into its products and services.\n\nThe tech giant is heavy on its ecosystem through Copilot. Its important platforms, such as Windows 11, Bing and Edge, show its strong intentions to use AI to improve user experience. The latest upgrade (ver 11), integrating over 150 AI-assisted features, is another proof of Microsoft’s efforts toward novelty and user-centered design.\n\nIn terms of AI stock forecasts, Microsoft’s achievements seem optimistic. The company’s attempts to inject AI capabilities into Bing and Edge, shifting from conventional search approaches to offering rich visual material, demonstrate a forward-thinking strategy. That transition intends to provide consumers with a more engaging and customized digital experience, establishing a new benchmark for how technology interacts with everyday life.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of AI into Microsoft 365 Copilot and the release of AI-enhanced Surface devices demonstrate a comprehensive strategy for integrating AI into productivity tools and hardware. These advancements not only improve users’ creative and productive capacities but also demonstrate Microsoft’s strong position in the AI industry. As Microsoft continues to develop, it cements its place as a vital participant in the future of AI technology.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stands out among AI stocks, with a strong start in AI stock forecasts. In its most recent financial report, the company announced a significant increase with its first positive GAAP net income. That is a watershed event demonstrating Palantir’s budgetary restraint and operational excellence. Furthermore, with a sales prediction of at least $2.18 billion for the year, the company sets a positive tone for market participants.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir Technologies’ net income in the second quarter of 2023 was $28.13 million, with sales of $533.32 million. This period saw a significant improvement over the previous year’s net loss, indicating the company’s financial strength and operational effectiveness.\n\nFurthermore, Palantir’s AI capabilities are gaining traction, particularly with the introduction of “bootcamps.” These programs provide customers with hands-on experience with its AI systems, indicating a promising future in demand. During this time, Palantir’s shares increased by about 20%, indicating the company’s market confidence is expanding.\n\nIn conclusion, Palantir Technologies is establishing a distinctive place for itself in the ever-changing technology industry. By emphasizing the use of big data analytics, Palantir is actively influencing the direction of technology. The firm is a stock to watch in the always-changing tech industry as it continues to break new ground and play a bigger role in the AI space, especially in providing data-driven insights and forecasts. As a result, it is not surprising to find this name among ChatGPT stock predictions.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Feeling Shut Out? 3 Sizzling Stocks and the Pull-Back Prices to Watch For",
        "content": "While the fear of missing out (FOMO) is a powerful emotion, sometimes the patient approach to stock prices to watch presents a better situation. I learned the hard way.\n\nIn January of this year, I hastily bought call options in Biomea Fusion (NASDAQ:BMEA) based largely on short-squeeze speculation. I didn’t even bother to understand what the company does. The next day, BMEA stock tumbled badly. Fortunately, I was able to get out of the trade with a profit – but only with the skin of my teeth.\n\nI won’t repeat the experience. FOMO got the best of me. And it will get the best of you if you’re not careful.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStill, I understand the pangs of regret of not biting on a hot stock. We’ve all been there. However, there are few things worst in the market than converting FOMO into pain. Let’s try to avoid that with a little prudence. Below are key stock prices to watch.\n\nIntuitive Machines (LUNR) Intuitive Machines (LUNR) black and white logo displayed on smartphone screen with desktop screen behind it showing company website and image of moon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nOne of the high-flying speculative enterprises, Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ:LUNR) specializes in lunar program specialties. These include lunar surface access, orbit delivery, and communications at great distances. Days ago, the company was planning to launch its Nova-C commercial lunar lander with the help of launch partner SpaceX. Further, the mission had historical implications.\n\nAnother element that motivated LUNR stock to swing northward is the renewed interest in space exploration. Beyond just bragging rights, lunar missions should help accelerate scientific research. As well, the mission serves as a stepping to stone to exploring other parts of our galaxy.\n\nHowever, it’s also fair to call LUNR stock overpriced. According to StockCharts, the security’s relative strength indicator (RSI) stands at 85.75 points, indicating a wildly overbought status. Looking at LUNR’s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, the stock prints a double top breakout pattern, suggesting further bullishness.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, downside risk to $4.75 to $5 also exists based on supply demand dynamics in the charts. Also, LUNR exceeded analysts’ average price target of $5 (and the high side of $6). Therefore, it’s one of the stock prices to watch – but not to buy just yet.\n\nRalph Lauren (RL) A Ralph Lauren outlet, October 21, 2013, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nSource: Martin Good / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most popular fashion companies, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) represents a top-tier discretionary retail brand. However, is it top tier enough to warrant RL stock printing a nearly 24% return since the beginning of January? Let’s add to the question: is Ralph Lauren worth a market premium of almost 53% up over the past 52 weeks? Because that’s exactly what’s happening.\n\nPersonally, it’s difficult to see RL stock continuing to march higher given its overheated status. Looking at the charts, the equity’s RSI indicator clocks in at 83.31 points. That’s extremely overbought and when we saw a similar scenario play out in December, Ralph Lauren pulled back. Of course, it quickly shot higher but this move seems awfully incredible.\n\nLooking at RL’s P&F chart, I recognize the ascending triple top breakout pattern posted on Feb. 15. However, supply demand dynamics suggest that if RL encounters headwinds, we’re looking at a possible correction to $138 to around $146.\n\nNotably, while analysts peg shares as a moderate buy, the $190.25 average price target implies only 5% upside. I think it’s one of the stock prices to watch.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFolks are bullish on SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) and for good reason. As InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer pointed out, SOUN stock jumped higher after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) disclosed that it held about $3.7 million of SoundHound’s shares. With Nvidia benefiting handsomely from artificial intelligence, it’s not surprise that it likes SoundHound, which converts human speech directly into language that AI-powered computers can understand.\n\nQuite possibly, the innovation could represent the key to making AI far-less frustrating. Believe it or not – and I believe because I’ve seen it – AI-driven chatbots are unreliable, even in the field of math which should be their forte. It’s math, after all. Still, I’m not entirely sure that SOUN won’t incur a near-term correction.\n\nYes, the Nvidia news is awesome but we’ve already seen how other AI-related enterprises have stumbled. Plus, SOUN prints an RSI of 84.94 points, indicating an extreme magnitude of overbought pressure. If the rally doesn’t hold, it’s quite possible to see shares correct to around $2.25.\n\nAnalysts don’t agree, though, pegging SOUN a unanimous strong buy with a $4.67 target. At the very least, you’ll need to be careful.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing in AI stocks is thrilling, especially now in February 2024. Furthermore, the best AI stocks come from companies leading the way in new ideas. This is making tech that could really shake up our lives and jobs.\n\nThese industry-leading companies show they can cater to enterprises and professionals demanding AI tech. This sets them up nicely for more success in the future. They have an edge in one way or another, whether that be having thousands of AI patents or owning a technology that is needed to run AI.\n\nAs such, they offer a promising opportunity for investors looking for AI stocks to invest in now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a key player in AI thanks to its GPUs. For instance, the A100 and the ultra-modern H100 Tensor Core GPU have become foundational in training advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nThe H100 uses high-level AI innovation in the form of Hopper architecture, which has the scalability and computing efficiency needed for huge AI workloads. This functionality has come with a huge demand for this tech from government organizations, cloud services, and more. That’s good news for Nvidia stocks!\n\nThere’s competition in any industry, and Nvidia has companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) angling for a market share. However, Nvidia’s commitment to pushing out next-gen tech is keeping it in the lead.\n\nAugust 2023 saw the release of the Hopper GH200, with active deliveries set to start in Q2 2024. There’s also the Black GB200 in the works, offering faster, more accurate training of sophisticated AI models.\n\nNvidia’s position on the list of best AI stocks for February 2024 is not just because of its hardware offerings. The company also has CUDA, a computing software that’s becoming the go-to for developers working on training enterprise-level AI models.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has surged by more than 40% since the beginning of the year, it remains one of the best AI stocks. Analysts expect EPS growth of 268% in FY2024 and 68% in FY2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, NVIDIA announced it would hold a conference call on February 21 to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. In the last quarter, the semiconductor giant reported earnings of $3.92 per share, with revenue of $18.12 billion.\n\nWith exciting product cycles to come and increasing AI adoption in varied industries, NVIDIA and its stocks are well-positioned to capitalize on AI’s growth.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nThe top AI stocks in February show great promise for companies doing the futuristic work of shifting enterprise AI usage from the experimentation stage to active implementation. One company helping its clients adopt AI technology is Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). In 2023, it announced a $3 billion investment in its AI division to assist customers in leveraging AI for enhanced business productivity.\n\nThis company is witnessing a huge demand for its services and is poised to capitalize on this opportunity. Accenture is a market leader in AI, with up to 1,450 AI patents and many more pending applications. Accenture is also leveraging its market-leading expertise to help clients in varied industries use AI to scale their operations.\n\nThe biggest selling point for Accenture is its specialized services, which revolve around personalization in generative AI. Through these services, Accenture is pushing the frontier, giving enterprises in manufacturing, retail, and other fields the power to modify foundational models as needed. It also offer a proprietary switchboard technology that combines various generative AI models to fit unique enterprise operational needs.\n\nAI may be a dream for many. However, for Accenture, that dream is now. The last fiscal year saw $300 million in sales from generative AI. This year, it already managed $450 million in bookings.\n\nIf numbers are to be believed—and in the investment world, they are—Accenture stocks are set for a massive bull run.\n\nAlongside the impressive sales numbers, the company is set to double the number of AI specialists it employs to 80,000. With only 12% of global companies able to harness AI capabilities, Accenture is likely to play a major role in disrupting the global business landscape through generative AI.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM)  is one of the biggest players providing cloud and quantum computing solutions. Also, its further advances are within AI, creating some of the most powerful AI systems like Watson, which are used across different industries, functions, and practices—be it data analysis, human language understanding, or decision-making.\n\nIBM surprised experts by predicting a better-than-expected growth of around 5% in its sales for 2024, not counting changes in currency value. It also expects to have about $12 billion in free cash flow this year, which is impressive.\n\nIBM said more customers using AI systems boosted the demand for its software and services. Some top experts also pointed out that IBM’s estimate of having $12 billion in cash for 2024 stands out, especially since they had thought it would be between $11 billion and $11.5 billion.\n\nIt has a price-earnings ratio of 18.3, which analysts think investors can take advantage of now. Hence, the company’s excellent future and good value make IBM one of the best AI stocks to keep in view in February 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Could Investing $20,000 in Nvidia Make You a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has turned out to be a top investment over the past decade. A $20,000 investment made in the semiconductor giant 10 years ago would be worth more than $3.4 million today -- up by around 170 times in value.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the company has taken less than a decade to turn a $20,000 investment into precisely a $1 million. Assuming you bought $20,000 worth of Nvidia stock on Aug. 1, 2016, your investment would now be worth just into seven figures. NVDA Chart\n\nSo, if you have $20,000 in investible cash after paying your bills, retiring any high-interest debt, and building up an emergency fund large enough to cover you in rough times, should you be putting that money into Nvidia in the hopes that it can replicate its past performance and make you a millionaire?\n\nHow Nvidia grew 50-fold in less than a decade\n\nNvidia's business has grown tremendously in the past eight years. In its fiscal 2016 (which ended Jan. 31, 2016), the company reported $5 billion in revenue. When the company releases its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results later this week, its annual revenue is expected to come in at almost $60 billion.\n\nThat stunning 12-fold increase in revenue in eight years means that Nvidia's revenue increased at a compound annual rate of 36%. This impressive growth can be attributed to the company's dominant position in the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), which were originally used in gaming personal computers (PCs) to improve the graphics performance of games. Its graphics cards are now deployed in multiple areas ranging from automotive to data centers to digital twins.\n\nThe market has handsomely rewarded Nvidia for its growth, and it is now the world's fourth-largest company, boasting a market capitalization of $1.82 trillion. That's a massive step up from the company's $30 billion market cap back in August 2016. And the company still has some terrific growth drivers that could help it maintain a solid pace of growth in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the first of those catalysts. The market for AI chips could be worth $305 billion in 2030 as compared to $29 billion in 2022. With a market share of 92% in that niche, Nvidia is in a prime position to capitalize. Meanwhile, the company has been gaining ground in the multibillion-dollar market for digital twins as well.\n\nThrow in other catalysts, such as the cloud gaming market, and it is easy to see why consensus estimates are for the company's earnings to increase at a compound annual rate of just over 100% for the next five years. Even better, Nvidia management pointed out in its investor day presentation a couple of years ago that it sees revenue opportunities worth a whopping $1 trillion across its various end markets.\n\nGiven that Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue is set to come in at just under $60 billion, it can be said that it hasn't scratched even 10% of its total addressable market. So, based on Nvidia's total addressable market estimate, the possibility of the company's revenue growing 12-fold again cannot be ruled out.\n\nHowever, how long that would take or whether it's really going to happen are in question, and something similar can be said about the stock's ability to turn a $20,000 investment into a $1 million stake.\n\nCan this semiconductor giant grow 50-fold once again?\n\nFrom its current market cap of around $1.8 trillion, a 50x jump would take its market cap to an astronomical $90 trillion. That seems absurd -- the entire global economy was worth an estimated $105 trillion last year.\n\nGiven that the global gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2.2% a year through 2030, the global economy could be worth around $122 trillion by the end of the decade. Expecting Nvidia to account for almost three-fourths of the global economy is not reasonable. However, it is worth noting that global GDP has increased by just over 1,800% in the past 50 years.\n\nAssuming that the global economy clocks 1,000% growth in the next 50 years, global GDP could reach $1.155 quadrillion. In that context, a $90 trillion market cap looks less impossible for Nvidia. If continues to exist for another half-century and remains the dominant supplier in its end markets thanks to its solid product development moves, it might turn a $20,000 investment made today into $1 million, eventually.\n\nOf course, if Nvidia fails to keep up with its competitors over those decades, it may not be able to give investors the returns they may be expecting. However, Nvidia's outlook for the next few years seems bright enough to warrant an investment.\n\nNvidia is still a top stock to buy right now\n\nWe have already seen how fast Nvidia is growing. More importantly, analysts are anticipating eye-popping bottom-line growth from the company thanks to its solid position in the AI chip market and the other catalysts it is sitting on. As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's stock delivering healthy returns over the next five years.\n\nGiven that Nvidia is trading at 35 times forward earnings as compared to its five-year average earnings multiple of 42, now would be a good time to buy this top AI stock before it surges higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SoftBank mulls $100 billion AI-chip play as big cash sloshes around the semiconductor sector",
        "content": "As the share prices of Arm and Nvidia have demonstrated in the last month—they’re up 63% and 26% respectively over that period—the chip sector is arguably where the action is these days. And the excitement continues to ratchet up.\n\nThe biggest (in money terms) news came on Friday, when Bloomberg reported that Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank planned to attack Nvidia head-on with a new AI chip venture, for which Son was hoping to raise $100 billion. Of that sum, $30 billion would apparently come from SoftBank and $70 billion from Middle Eastern institutions. The venture is reportedly codenamed Izanagi, in reference to the Japanese creator deity. SoftBank used to have a $3.6 billion stake in Nvidia, but dumped it all at the start of 2019, and now wants to create a rival.\n\nThe Izanagi news sent SoftBank’s share price up by nearly 5% today. If the plan comes to fruition, it will be interesting to see any alliance between it and Arm, in which SoftBank has a 90% stake. As Arm’s chip designs have become crucial to chipmakers such as Nvidia, Arm risks raising antitrust concerns if it partners with any chipmakers. Just ask Nvidia, whose planned $40 billion takeover of Arm collapsed two years ago in the face of regulatory scrutiny. (Nvidia did however recently take a $147 million stake in Arm, which currently enjoys a market cap of $132 billion.)\n\nSoftBank’s big chip play is yet another indicator of its pivot from funding startups—which mostly turned out pretty badly—to focusing on semiconductors. The company is awash with cash, thanks to both a windfall stemming from the 2020 merger of T-Mobile US with SoftBank's Sprint, and the sudden rise in Arm’s fortunes. (It may or may not be worth noting at this point that SoftBank is among the rumored potential buyers for the U.K. AI-chip firm Graphcore, which is hemorrhaging money and desperately seeking a way out.)\n\nAs for looking to the Middle East for the rest of Izanagi’s funding…well, that sounds familiar. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is doing the same thing for his proposed, supposedly multi-trillion-dollar AI-chip venture, and Bloomberg reported Friday that he’s seeking the U.S. government’s blessing, for a couple reasons. First, there’s a likelihood of major Middle Eastern backing sparking a national-security review. Second, if this ends up being a separate venture from OpenAI but OpenAI ends up being a customer or competitor, Altman could place himself in a conflict of interest that might attract antitrust scrutiny.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking of the U.S. government, the Biden administration is starting to hand out the first really enormous piles of subsidies under the 2022 CHIPS Act, to stimulate semiconductor manufacturing on American soil. (Microchip Technology has already been awarded $162 million, and BAE Systems $35 million.) Today, the government announced it had signed preliminary terms with GlobalFoundries, in which the giant chipmaking contractor will receive $1.5 billion to build out and modernize its U.S. production capabilities. And Bloomberg reports that Intel may receive $10 billion to support the onshoring of some of its manufacturing.\n\nEven if the up-to-$7 trillion Altman is reportedly seeking for his chip venture is fantasy money, the real sums in play these days are eye-watering enough.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings highlight shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks nearly recovered after a hotter-than-expected inflation report sent the market lower on Tuesday.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed down 0.4% but cracked a fresh record-high close on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.1% for the week. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1.3%.\n\nMarkets will be closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday.\n\nWith few economic events on the calendar expected to severely sway investor sentiment, the earnings report from AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday after the market close will take center stage in the week ahead. Reports from Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Moderna (MRNA), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) will also be in focus throughout the week.\n\nA blip in the economic story\n\nThe growing economic consensus has hit a bump in the road.\n\nOver the past several months, a string of stronger-than-expected data had many investors embracing a possible soft landing, in which inflation would fall to the Federal Reserve's 2% target without a severe economic downturn.\n\nRecent data over the past week has challenged that narrative. Both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) showed prices increased more than economists projected in the last month. And the January retail sales report showed sales dropped by more than economists had expected. In other words, neither inflation nor consumer spendingimproved.\n\n\"While January data are often noisy, the inflation data do suggest that disinflation took two steps back in January,\" Bank of America US economists Stephen Juneau and Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nJuneau and Gapen wrote that the January inflation data vindicates the Fed's \"wait-and-see approach\" to cutting interest rates and that they agree with the new market consensus that the first interest rate cut will come in June rather than March or May.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nThis marks a stark shift in investor sentiment on Fed cuts. Investors are now pricing in a roughly 35% chance the first cut comes in May, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, investors had placed a 97% chance that the first cut would come by the end of the May meeting.\n\nNvidia takes center stage\n\nPerhaps the most important earnings report of the fourth quarter reporting season is slated to hit the tape on Wednesday after the closing bell. The chipmaker's lead in AI has propelled it to the third-highest market cap in the world, only trailing Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nSince a blowout earnings report last May when Nvidia topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue guidance by more than 50%, the company has consistently topped analysts' expectations. And many on Wall Street expect another blowout quarter. Consensus projects Nvidia to report earnings per share of $4.60 and revenue of $20.36 billion. That would mark year-over-year growth of 422% and 236%, respectively.\n\nFor a stock that has already rallied almost 50% this year, the risk for investors lies in if the company's string of hefty beats finally ends. And given Nvidia's outsized weighting in the major indexes and its value in the AI story, it could be a risk to the broader market too.\n\nInteractive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance's Madison Mills that the report could be \"very difficult\" for markets.\n\n\"If Nvidia misses or just fails to hit a home run ... that can have a gravitational effect on the whole market,\" Sosnick said.\n\nThe market narrative hasn't changed, yet\n\nNvidia's earnings are a reminder that while the recent string of economic data provided some challenges to the soft-landing narrative, the overall market story has changed little in recent weeks. Stocks have stomached unsatisfying news, with the S&P 500 hitting fresh highs despite a shift in investor expectations from the rate cut cycle starting in March to the cycle beginning in June.\n\nAI stocks are still shooting higher as enthusiasm remains plentiful for the new technology (see the 150% one-month gain in Super Micro Computer (SMCI) for the latest example). And a look under the surface shows that the fundamental story for stocks has held up too.\n\nThe latest data from FactSet, released on Friday, shows that with nearly 80% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the index is pacing for earnings growth of 3.2% in the fourth quarter. That number has been moving up steadily in recent weeks as more companies report.\n\nAs we've been noting, earnings beats have come across sectors too, which many believe could lead to a broadening of market returns beyond just a few top tech stocks later this year. Recent research from Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out that, sincethe market's recent bottom in late October, a broadening has been underway.\n\n\"The market rally that we have seen since October is broader than many investors give it credit for,\" Lerner wrote in a note to clients on Thursday night.\n\nThis played out in the most recent week of trading with the equal-weighted S&P 500 (RSP) and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) — two indexes commonly referenced by market strategists who think the stock market rally will extend beyond the few stocks currently leading the charge. Both rose more than 0.7%. The S&P 500 fell about 0.4%.\n\nThese signs of a market shift come as Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta pointed out several times this week that the soft-landing market narrative still remains in play. And that is largely because the macro conversation hasn't changed, Dutta added.\n\n\"We’re still talking about an economy that is growing reasonably well and a central bank that is thinking about when it will cut rates,\" Dutta wrote. \"A recalibration of policy is still likely this year.\" SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 05: A sign is posted at Nvidia headquarters on February 05, 2024 in Santa Clara, California.

        "title": "GLOBAL MARKETS-World shares flattened by stubborn inflation and slow China growth",
        "content": "*\n\nEuropean shares dip, S&P futures quiet with Wall St off\n\n*\n\nChina markets make modest gains on return from LNY holiday\n\n*\n\nGlobal bonds price for fewer, later rate cuts\n\n*\n\nNvidia results to test limits of AI euphoria\n\n(Adds quote in paragraph 10, updates prices throughout)\n\nBy Nell Mackenzie\n\nLONDON Feb 19 (Reuters) - World shares struggled to climb on Monday after the chances of early interest rate cuts globally receded and Chinese markets recorded modest gains on their return from the lunar new year break.\n\nA holiday for U.S. markets made for thin trading, and results from AI star Nvidia on Wednesday could challenge the latest surge in tech stocks.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of world shares and Europe's broader index of stocks both traded around 0.05% as of 13:53 GMT.\n\n\"The mixed economic data released lately has put us in a transition period and we are waiting for the data to tell a consistent story,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, said.\n\nA red-hot U.S. CPI print on Tuesday followed by another upside surprise in producer prices on Friday left investors anxious inflation will persist. A weaker retail sales report, suggesting slower economic momentum augmented their concerns.\n\nHowever, U.S. labour market numbers have continued to show plentiful jobs and elevated wage growth.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei ended flat on Monday, pressured by chip-related shares following a slump in their U.S. counterparts late last week.\n\nChinese blue chips finished up just over 1%, after tourism revenues during the Lunar New Year holiday surged by 47% compared with a year earlier as more than 61 million rail trips were taken.\n\nThe country's central bank skipped another chance to cut rates on Sunday, limiting downward pressure on the yuan, but as deflation looms, analysts see scope for further policy stimulus.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the United States as high readings on producer and consumer prices led markets to scale back pricing for rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The risk to the rally is a stronger pick-up in inflation leading to higher yields,\" said Alain Bokobza head of global asset allocation in a Societe Generale note.\n\nNon-recessionary rate cuts pushing up yields and a slowing of Nasdaq growth might drive volatility, which the note said was likely in the second half of this year.\n\nFutures dropped, implying a 28% chance rates will be cut in May.\n\nHANGING ON NVIDIA\n\nThe surprise on inflation means the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting out this week will look dated, but any talk about the timing of potential cuts will be noted.\n\nThere are plenty of Fed speakers out this week to comment on the outlook, with Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller of particular interest.\n\nThe market sea change on rates saw two-year Treasury yields spike to a 2024 high of 4.72% on Friday before steadying at 4.64%. Treasury futures were little changed on Monday with the cash market closed.\n\nS&P 500 futures ticked up by 0.1%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.21%, helped by hopes Nvidia could somehow beat already stratospheric expectations.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has surged 46% so far this year and accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains. There is reason for optimism given that of the 80% of S&P 500 reporting so far, 75% have beaten forecasts.\n\nHigher bond yields underpinned the dollar at 149.99 yen , though the possibility of Bank of Japan intervention to prop up the yen has so far capped the currency pair at 150.88.\n\nThe dollar index was a touch firmer, while the euro was tipped lower on the day at around $1.0770 .\n\nThe rise in yields did not prevent non-yielding gold firming 0.2% to around $2,015 an ounce.\n\nOil prices eased as doubts about demand tussled with the threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent slipped 12 cents to $83.35 a barrel, while U.S. crude for April rose 11 cents to $79.30 per barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe, Sam Holmes, Shri Navaratnam, Susan Fenton and Barbara Lewis)",

        "title": "4 Stocks to Buy on Semiconductor Industry's Growth Potential",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry didn’t have a memorable 2023, as sales declined year over year. However, the good sign is that the industry has been trying to stage a solid rebound since the second half of the year. Sales have been steadily on the rise and are poised to grow further in 2024.\n\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said earlier this month that global semiconductor sales totaled $526.8 billion in 2023, reflecting a decline of 8.2% from $574.1 billion in 2022.\n\nHowever, microchip sales totaled $146 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, jumping 11.6% year over year and 8.4% sequentially. Also, sales increased month over month in December, totaling $48.6 billion, a rise of 1.5% from November, according to the SIA.\n\nThe semiconductor industry witnessed unprecedented growth during the peak of the pandemic. However, challenges such as rising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates due to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening policy began impacting sales in 2022 as demand waned.\n\nThe initial slow sales of semiconductors in the first half of 2022 were attributed to inventory adjustments made by clients in the PC, consumer electronics and server sectors. The situation improved in the second half of 2023 as inflation showed signs of decline, alleviating price pressures.\n\nIn 2023, semiconductor products across segments recorded impressive sales. Logic products emerged as the leading category, with sales totaling $178.5 billion.\n\nFollowing closely, memory products totaled $92.3 billion in sales. Microcontroller units (MCUs) saw robust growth of 11.4%, totaling $27.9 billion in sales. Also, sales of automotive integrated circuits (ICs) witnessed impressive year-over-year growth of 23.7%, setting a new record at $42.2 billion.\n\nNow, SIA anticipates double-digit growth in semiconductor sales, driven by increasing demand. Also, the industry is going to benefit once the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, as it will further ease price pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks like Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and Lam Research Corporation LRCX, which investors can gain from in the near term.\n\nApplied Materials, Inc. is one of the world's largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays, and solar photovoltaic cells and modules. AMAT also offers deployment and support services related to the equipment supplied.\n\nApplied Materials’ expected earnings growth rate for next year is 11.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the past 60 days. AMAT presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU). Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores necessary to run deep-learning algorithms.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 64.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. Through global brands, namely Micron, Crucial and Ballistix, MU manufactures and markets high-performance memory and storage technologies, including Dynamic Random Access Memory, NAND flash memory, NOR Flash, 3D XPoint memory and other technologies. Micron Technology’s solutions are used in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking and mobile products.\n\nMicron Technology’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 1,723.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 61.3% over the past 60 days. MU currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nLam Research Corporation supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. LAM’s products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in front-end and WLP processes, creating memory, microprocessors, and other logic-integrated circuits for a broad range of electronic devices.\n\nLam Research Corporation’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 400%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 37.5% over the past 60 days. LRCX presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Photronics PLAB is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 21.\r\n\r\nFor the to-be-reported quarter, PLAB expects revenues between $217 million and $225 million. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be between 45 and 53 cents.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line is pegged at 49 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating 22.5% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missing in one and matching in the remaining quarter, the average surprise being 8.51%.\n\nPhotronics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Photronics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPhotronics, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Photronics, Inc. Quote\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nPhotronics’ first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to suffer from sluggishness in the semiconductor end market. Lower demand for IC, particularly from mainstream Asian manufacturers, is expected to have hurt top-line growth in the seasonally weaker to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing usage of AMOLED in high-end tablets, laptops and automotive applications is expected to have aided top-line growth.\r\n\r\nPhotronics benefits from long-term agreements with its customers in terms of average selling price and fab utilization rate. Gross margin is expected to have benefited from strong demand for both high-end ICD and FPD products. A favorable product mix and stringent cost control also benefit the bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.\r\n\r\nPhotronics has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

        "title": "Investors better hope the blasts from the past don't rock them today",
        "content": "Nvidia's Stock Price Hits Record High, As Analysts Increase Their Outlook On The Company\n\nWe find it fitting that the Technotronic classic Pump up the Jam perfectly characterizes the current market environment, especially since it was released in 1989, around the same time the average U.S. equity trader was born.\n\nOnly a few stocks dominate today’s global markets, with those beating the Artificial Intelligence Jam getting pumped up big time while the rest get ignored. This creates a real problem for those of us who are quite familiar with these blasts from the past, having been born a decade or two before.\n\nTake legendary investor David Einhorn, founder of Greenlight Capital Inc., who has decided to wave the white flag and change strategies altogether by focusing on those companies that will pay him back via share buybacks and dividends since investors appear to no longer want to properly reward non-AI companies for success.\n\nYou might think money would eventually start to move into other segments, but the opposite is happening. Not so long ago, it used to only be about the Magnificent Seven, but that’s since been whittled down to the Magnificent Three complemented by a few smaller AI companies.\n\nFor example, since 2022, Nvidia Corp. is up more than 150 per cent, Meta Platforms Inc. is up 40 per cent and Microsoft Corp. nearly 25 per cent, according to Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning LLC. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up only eight per cent, Apple Inc. is up five per cent, Amazon.com Inc. is up three per cent and Alphabet Inc. is up by only one per cent, while Tesla Inc. has run out of battery power and is down by over 45 per cent.\n\nIt doesn’t help that giants such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., despite already sitting on a pile of cash, have been trimming their position in Apple. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller dumped shares of Alphabet, Amazon and Broadcom Inc., but is still sitting on his largest position — Nvidia.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has now surpassed both Alphabet and Amazon in market cap and is also larger than the entire U.S. energy sector combined, which produces more than 13 million barrels per day. Then you have smaller companies such as Super Micro Computer Inc., which is up over 200 per cent this year. If you had invested $10,000 in that company about four years ago, it would be worth roughly $325,000 today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore impressive is that these few dominant companies seem completely unaffected by broader market developments while the majority of the others are not as fortunate and are selling off on negative macro developments and barely moving on positive micro ones.\n\nFor example, on Feb. 13, worries about interest rates after higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data came in had zero impact on Nvidia and Super Micro Computer and yet the iShares Select Dividend ETF, representing the largest U.S. dividend companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc., sold off nearly three per cent.\n\nYou also had West Texas Intermediate oil prices that rose one per cent and yet both Canadian and U.S. exploration and production companies were down two per cent on the day.\n\nThose few of us goals-based investment managers have the luxury of watching all this from the sidelines, given we don’t have to chase any tech-heavy benchmarks or try to get the entry and exit timing right, which we think is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do.\n\nThe longer this goes on, the greater the fall, and some fall it will be if companies such as Nvidia follow the same path that Cisco Systems Inc. did post-2000. However, this all means putting up with days like Feb. 13 in the interim.\n\nIn today’s environment, our conservative pension-like portfolio is by no means as sexy as Nvidia, but it’s doing the job for us and our clients. Our allocation remains: 45 per cent long equity with an overweight in dividend-focused companies in Canada and the U.S. paying on average five per cent in dividends; 40 per cent in structured notes as a fixed-income replication, paying six per cent to 12 per cent annual coupons with 30 per cent downside barriers; 10 per cent in short-term bonds and the money market paying five per cent to 6.5 per cent; and five per cent in private equity for longer-term, low-double-digit growth. This is enabling us to meet our clients’ financial goals and objectives.\n\nMarkets have turned into a one-trick pony Investors should stay aware of how everything is connected A new way to use the old retirement laddering strategy\n\nWhile we like the tunes from ’89, such as Poison, Paradise City, Every Rose has its Thorn, Bust a Move, Girl You Know It’s True, The Look, Like a Prayer and How Can I Fall, we just don’t want them in our portfolios.\n\nMartin Pelletier, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Counsel Inc, operating as TriVest Wealth Counsel, a private client and institutional investment firm specializing in discretionary risk-managed portfolios, investment audit/oversight and advanced tax, estate and wealth planning.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nIf you like this story, sign up for the FP Investor Newsletter.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the business news you need to know — add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.",

        "title": "Should You Be Adding NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's Improving Profits\n\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that NVIDIA's EPS went from US$2.39 to US$7.65 in just one year. Even though that growth rate may not be repeated, that looks like a breakout improvement. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 20.4 percentage points to 46%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this freeinteractive visualization of NVIDIA's forecast profits?\n\nStory continues\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$71b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nShould You Add NVIDIA To Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for NVIDIA  you should know about.\n\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Investors Are Piling Into Nvidia Stock. But Nvidia Is Investing in 5 Other AI Stocks.",
        "content": "Over any meaningful time span, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a blockbuster investment. It's up almost 1,800% over the last five years, and it has more than tripled in the past year alone, fueled by investors' excitement for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere's good reason to believe Nvidia is a top AI stock. Management attributes its surging revenue to AI-related products and services. To illustrate how strong demand is, the company expects to report revenue of $20 billion in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. That would be a 231% year-over-year increase -- simply astounding for a company of this size.\n\nAI is the top investment trend right now, and Nvidia stock is one of the most popular ways to ride the trend higher. However, for its part, the company is buying shares of five other AI companies.\n\nThis interesting development made the news on Feb. 14 with Nvidia's first 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This form is for institutional investment managers to report their stock holdings.\n\nAccording to its 13F, Nvidia has a stock portfolio worth $230 million, and these are the AI stocks it's been buying.\n\nA glimpse inside Nvidia's stock portfolio\n\nNvidia's 13F shows it owns only five stocks, but all five have a connection to AI in some capacity. Here's a quick overview of each company, from the largest investment down to the smallest.\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) licenses its AI semiconductor chip designs to other companies, and this business is in high demand right now. Nvidia tried to acquire Arm back in 2020 but finally called it off in 2022 after pushback from regulators. Now, it will look to benefit as an investor. This is Nvidia's largest stock position, valued at $147 million as of the SEC filing. Next in Nvidia's portfolio is Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX). This early-stage biotechnology company is using AI models to process genetic data and find new drugs. It's an idea that could be game-changing for the medical field, which is why the stock has also caught the attention of growth investor Cathie Wood. SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) offers an AI voice assistant that's similar to what's already offered by major tech companies. However, SoundHound AI believes its AI is more capable of understanding normal language. And based on its growing customer list, there seems to be support for management's claim. Of Nvidia's stocks, investors might want to disregard TuSimple Holdings, considering it's delisting from the Nasdaq. That said, this company has an AI angle as well -- it's working to enable autonomous driving for trucking companies. Finally, Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX) -- or just Nanox -- is Nvidia's smallest stock position. This company hopes to transition the world to a new digital X-ray technology. It intends to use AI to go through these digital images and find patterns that doctors might overlook, leading to better outcomes for patients.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, I personally believe the trend, as a whole, is overhyped. And stock market history is littered with past trends that eventually fizzled out. Therefore, investors need to be discerning.\n\nThat said, I believe AI can unlock a lot of possibilities when it comes to the medical field. This is why I'm particularly intrigued with Nvidia's investments in Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox.\n\nThese two stocks are particularly high-risk and high-reward\n\nFull disclaimer before I go any further: I am not a medical expert in the slightest. I'm just a regular investor on the outside looking in. Investing great Warren Buffett says to stay inside of your circle of competence. And fellow great Peter Lynch says to invest in what you know. Medical stocks aren't that for me.\n\nHowever, I do know enough to understand datasets are enormous in this field, and processing large amounts of data is where AI really shines.\n\nConsider one of Recursion Pharmaceutical's newest partnerships as an example. In the third quarter of 2023, it partnered with Tempus to gain access to 20 additional petabytes (over 20,000,000 gigabytes) of oncology data. It now has a staggering 50 petabytes at its disposal for cancer research. And to process this much information, the company will keep working with Nvidia to make its BioHive-1 supercomputer more powerful.\n\nNanox only has a limited number of medical devices in operation right now. But when it went public in 2020, the company hoped to eventually deploy 15,000 machines, which would make more than 150 monthly digital scans each.\n\nNanox is still a long way from that goal, and it may never get there. But hitting its goals would represent nearly 2.3 million medical images per month. This could quickly become the largest medical-imaging dataset in the world, and the company will need to use AI to make any sort of discovery.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are looking to use AI to unlock important medical breakthroughs by using enormous medical datasets. This is why I say these two stocks have enticing upside.\n\nThat said, both Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox have meager revenue streams and enormous losses, as the chart below shows. RXRX Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals and Nanox are very high-risk stocks, and investing in them should not be taken lightly. Both have an elevated chance of failing, and Nvidia's investment in them shouldn't be viewed as something that guarantees success.\n\nIt's exciting to think about what could happen if things go right, and AI leads these two companies to major breakthroughs. Investors just need to keep their emotions in check, fully recognizing the risks that come with these stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Budget Semiconductor Stocks to Own Before the 2024 Crypto Bull Run",
        "content": "Budget semiconductor stocks are set for a boost with Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) long-anticipated halving event scheduled to take place in April. The halving is a cyclical event in which the scarcity of Bitcoin is increased as the volume of cryptocurrency awarded to miners is halved. Many investors are expecting market-wide rallies that are similar in scale to the 2021 bull run.\n\n“If ETF-related inflows materialize as we expect, we think an end-2025 level closer to USD 200,000 is possible,” explained Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered.\n\nSo where does the semiconductor industry factor in a crypto bull run? The demand for semiconductors increases during crypto bull runs due to the increased need for a high computing power. The semiconductor market is already enjoying an impressive rally off the back of 2023’s generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom. By powering the cryptocurrency mining revival this year, we will see sustained growth and the emergence of fresh market players throughout the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor some budget semiconductor stocks that may have room to grow, it’s worth considering the following three options.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, is the world’s largest semiconductor operator, boasting a 56% market share.\n\nDespite its advantageous market position, TSMC was overshadowed by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023. Consequently, there’s ample opportunity for the stock to benefit from heightened investor demand during the crypto bull run.\n\nTSMC has been actively countering potential risks stemming from geopolitical tension between China and Taiwan by building new locations across the globe.\n\nThe company’s revenue forecasts for 2024 anticipated 25% growth, so there’s plenty for investors to be excited about. With more crypto miners set to seek out semiconductor solutions to support their operations, we’ll see TSMC’s status as a market leader place the firm in good stead.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputing giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has endured a volatile start to 2024. After sales and profitability forecasts fell far below Wall Street expectations, the stock tumbled 12% at the end of January — its largest decline in over three years.\n\nDespite this, the stock quickly recovered its losses. Bank of America analysts suggesting that Intel Foundry Services (IFS) could position itself as a leading alternative to TSMC drove Intel’s rebound.\n\nWhile TSMC’s position as a market leader is strong, geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan may push more customers towards IFS.\n\nThe custom chip market topped $30 billion in 2023. The generative AI boom, coupled with renewed interest in cryptocurrency mining, could form the perfect storm for Intel’s growing expansion into the 2024 world of semiconductors.\n\nAxcelis (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other semiconductor stocks we’ve looked at in this article, Axcelis (NASDAQ:ACLS) doesn’t produce chips itself. Rather, this stock manufactures ion implantation equipment that plays a major role in the creation of chips. Axcelis produces semiconductor hardware like storage (NAND) chips, memory (DRAM) chips and advanced logic (CPU) chips.\n\nIn 2023, Axcelis reportedly experienced exceptional demand in the silicon-carbide power device market. The company had a major $1.2 billion order backlog, amounting to the equivalent of a year’s worth of revenue.\n\nWith a market cap of less than $5 billion, Axcelis is a relatively small company that’s ripe for growth. As the demand for ion implantation grows amidst the crypto boom, we could see Axcelis achieve exceptional numbers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 ETF Areas to Follow This Week",
        "content": "Wall Street was downbeat last week as evident from a 0.4% fall in the S&P 500. The down Jones was off 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3% due to rising rates. The benchmark U.S. treasury yield started the week at 4.17% and closed out the week at 4.30%. The inflation prints (which means the Fed is likely to cut rates in the near term) led to rise in bond yields.\n\nMeanwhile, January retail sales data came in at soft. In January, U.S. retail sales experienced a setback, slipping more than anticipated. The Commerce Department's Census Bureau reported a 0.8% drop in retail sales for the month, down from a 0.4% gain in December and worse than the estimate for a 0.3% drop (per a CNBC article). The drop in sales was caused declines in both auto dealership and gasoline service station receipts (read: 4 ETF Areas to Play Despite Soft January Retail Sales).\n\nOn a positive note, although the S&P 500 was down for the week, the index hit an all-time high last week. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged past the $52,000 mark for the first time since December 2021. The surge primarily came on the back of the increasing movement of institutional money into the asset class (read: Bitcoin Tops 52,000: 5 ETFs Leading the Rally).\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) experienced a notable increase, climbing 4 points to reach 48 in February. This improvement marks the third successive month of positive sentiment in the housing market and represents the highest level of confidence since August 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF areas that should be under close watch to start this week.\n\nNvidia to Beat on Earnings?\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) NVIDIA NVDA is set to report its earnings on Feb 21, 2024, after the market closed. NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +3.67%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The Zacks Consensus Earnings and Sales estimates for the to-be-reported quarter for Nvidia are $4.45 and $20.21 billion, respectively.\n\nNvidia-heavy ETFs like VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI and Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ should be under watch for likely gains.\n\nRates to Rise Again?\n\nSimplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) has jumped 5.9% last week as rates rose driven by a spike in inflation. In January, U.S. inflation topped expectations as persistently high shelter prices weighed heavily on consumers. The consumer price index rose by 0.3% for the month (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks to Benefit from Hot Inflation).\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the increase stood at 3.1%, a slight decrease from December's 3.4%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had anticipated a monthly increase of 0.2% and an annual gain of 2.9%. However, the actual figures surpassed these expectations, as quoted on CNBC.\n\nHeadline month-over-month producer price index (PPI) reached +0.3%, 20 bps higher than the +0.1% expected — in fact, the highest we’ve seen since +0.4% reported in September of last year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core print comes in much hotter, i.e., +0.5% from an anticipated gain of 0.1%, which is the highest print since the early part of 2022, back when the Fed first started raising interest rates to cool inflation.\n\nThis means rates are likely to remain high in the near term and ETFs that give investors protection against high rates should continue to excel.\n\nBitcoin Miners to Fall On Profit Booking?\n\nBitcoin prices gained about a modest 4% last week but bitcoin miners skyrocketed on blockbuster Coinbase earnings. GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF CONL surged 55% last week while Global X Blockchain ETF BKCH advanced 17.6%.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) cheered investors after reporting solid fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results on Feb 15, after the closing bell. It posted its first quarterly profit in two years, beating on earnings and revenues. Trading volume also surged on a new wave of optimism about digital assets, marking a turning point for the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange (read: Coinbase Surges on Blockbuster Q4 Earnings: ETFs to Buy).\n\nInvestors may intend book profits on ETFs like Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF FDIG (up 13.8% last week, up 29.2% past month) and First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry & Digital Economy ETF CRPT (up 13.7% last week, up 39.6% past month). So, one should tread cautiously on bitcoin miners and blockchain ETFs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "\"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Shake-Up -- 3 Business Stats You Need to See Right Now",
        "content": "Some of the fastest-growing, most profitable, and most powerful businesses in history have been born the last few decades. Over the last year, this collection of companies has become known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe rise of these top investments is thanks to the relentless advance of information technology, computing power, and the internet -- collectively built atop the practical application of semiconductors. But there's been a big shake-up in the ordering of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent weeks. Here's what investors need to know.\n\n\"Tiny\" Nvidia sails past Alphabet and Amazon\n\nIn mid-February 2024, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- by far the smallest of the Magnificent Seven companies as measured by revenue and total employees -- surpassed Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon in total market capitalization value. Times are changing, and investors are loading up on what is increasingly viewed as the emergent leader in the new artificial intelligence (read: accelerated computing) economy.\n\nCompany Year Founded Market Cap Trailing-12-Month Revenue ~Total Employees Microsoft 1975 $3.02 trillion $228 billion 221,000 Apple 1976 $2.84 trillion $386 billion 161,000 Nvidia  1993 $1.80 trillion $44.9 billion 26,000 Alphabet  1998 $1.78 trillion $307 billion 183,000 Amazon 1994 $1.76 trillion $575 billion 1.5 million Meta Platforms 2004 $1.23 trillion $135 billion 67,000 Tesla  2003 $639 billion $96.8 billion 140,000\n\nData source: YCharts and company financial filings, as of Feb. 16, 2024.\n\nIf you believe in compounding growth, it makes sense Microsoft and Apple are the largest companies by market capitalization. They've been around the longest and have thus had the most time to build their empires.\n\nNvidia hitting the No. 3 spot in market cap is notable, and not just because of its comparatively diminutive size. After Microsoft and Apple, Nvidia is the oldest business of the companies on this list of magnificent long-term investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut there are some other elements to Nvidia's business worth pointing out. The other six businesses have catapulted to stardom with very consumer-oriented business models: Microsoft and Apple are pioneers of the PC era, and Apple ushered in the mobile device explosion. Google still makes most its money from internet search, while Amazon e-commerce is ubiquitous in North America (although its cloud computing infrastructure unit AWS still pays most of the bills). And Tesla has successfully gotten the ball rolling on the electric vehicle and software-defined car market.\n\nNvidia's explosion onto the scene is thanks to AI infrastructure, a decidedly far more nebulous business to the average person. Of course, Nvidia is a consumer-facing company too, and if you're into PC video games, you've probably been very aware of Nvidia's existence since at least the early 2000s.\n\nBut video games are the minority revenue generator these days. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang decided to go all in on developing semiconductors and accelerated computing infrastructure a number of years ago, propelling the data center segment to dizzying heights in the last year. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nThree stats, and what they mean for investors\n\nNo matter how you slice it, though, Nvidia's rise to the third-largest Magnificent Seven stock as measured by market cap is astonishing. Paired with the two other stats in the aforementioned chart -- revenue and total employee count -- investors are clearly betting that Nvidia's actual business is going to get a lot bigger over the next few years.\n\nLet's emphasize the word betting. Nvidia's foundational work around next-gen computing infrastructure has been going on for years, but it was only somewhat recently recognized by the investor community at large. Many are scrambling for a cut and minimizing the fact that Nvidia has highly cyclical revenue, as do most research and development-driven semiconductor businesses. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe point is, Nvidia stock's latest surge shouldn't be expected to continue going up and to the right forever. It's a safe assumption to make that at some unknown point in the future, there will be a cooldown in AI infrastructure spending. When that happens, expect Nvidia stock to notch a significant sell-off, just like it has in the past. NVDA Chart\n\nAs a longtime happy shareholder of Nvidia, it's exciting to see the company's rapid progress. But be wary of all the hype as the company's status as a leader among the Magnificent Seven heats up. In fact, as wonderful as all these businesses are as top investments, they all go through cycles of growth and periods of more lackluster performance (like Tesla, which hasn't been so \"magnificent\" lately). A healthy dose of caution will serve long-term investors well at this juncture.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is a Beat Likely for NVIDIA (NVDA) This Earnings Season?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is likely to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Feb 21.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of $20 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $20.21 billion, indicating a whopping 234% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at $4.54 per share. This suggests year-over-year growth of 415.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 88 cents per share.\n\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 19%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe continued strength of its Datacenter business on the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA’s fourth-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the Datacenter end-market business is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to have aided the segment’s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Our third-quarter revenue estimate for the Datacenter end market is pegged at $16.4 billion, indicating robust year-over-year growth of 354.2%.\n\nMoreover, NVIDIA’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s last three quarters’ results had shown signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenues from the Gaming end market increased 81% year over year while growing 15% sequentially to $2.86 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Gaming end market stands at $2.83 billion, implying a 54.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nNVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 108% year over year and 10% sequentially in the third quarter. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter for the end market. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Professional Visualization end market is pegged at $433.3 million, suggesting a 91.7% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nFurther, the company’s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in eight of the last ten quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal fourth quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and AI cockpit solutions. Our fourth-quarter revenue estimate for the Automotive end market is pegged at $294.5 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.2%.\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVIDIA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\n\nEarnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate ($4.71 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($4.54 per share), is +3.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nZacks Rank: NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, Synchronoss Technologies SNCR, AutoZone AZO and Booking Holdings BKNG also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nSynchronoss sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +157.1%. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Mar 5. Its bottom-line result surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing on two occasions, the average surprise being -16.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchronoss’ fourth-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 11 cents per share, significantly narrower than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 72 cents. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $43.8 million, calling for a year-over-year decline of 29%.\n\nAutoZone is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.83% at present. AutoZone’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.9%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $26.18 per share, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $24.64. AutoZone’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 4.4% to $3.85 billion.\n\nBooking Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.07%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 16.4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Booking Holdings’ fourth-quarter earnings stands at $26.69 per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20%. It is estimated to report revenues of $4.65 billion, which implies an increase of approximately 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If you’re going to invest, you need to buy the best stocks at the right time and know when you see a bargain price that will help you beat the market. For my money, that means looking for A-rated stocks to buy.\n\nA stock gets its well-deserved “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader when it’s at the top of the class. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on things like earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and buying momentum.\n\nIt’s not easy for a stock to get an “A” grade, but I’ve come to believe that it’s a valuable method for evaluating stocks relatively quickly and forecasting which are doing the best job of providing investors outstanding returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI recommend choosing A-rated stocks to buy in a variety of sectors. It’s a good way to diversify your portfolio rather than letting yourself get too heavily tilted to technology, automotive, or other popular sectors.\n\nThis list has a variety of sectors for A-rated stocks to buy in February. According to the Portfolio Grader, this is a solid way to stack your portfolio.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nI get it. A retail stock probably isn’t your first choice when you think about A-rated stocks to buy. But Abercrombie &Fitch (NYSE:ANF) defies expectations that have been plaguing the retail sector.\n\nThe company, which is best known for its brands Abercrombie, Hollister and Gilly Hicks, has over 750 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It has avoided the supply chain issues, inflation woes and lowered profit margins that sent other retailers into a downturn.\n\nThe company saw strong sales across the board in the third quarter, with Americas sales up 22% to $867 million; sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up 14% to $157.9 million; and sales in the Asia-Pacific region up 13% to $30.8 million.\n\nOverall, ANF saw third-quarter sales of $1.1 billion, up 20% from a year ago. Abercrombie is reporting full-year and fourth quarter numbers next month, when it’s expected to post sales growth of 12% to 14% and an operating margin of roughly 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nANF stock is up 276% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (SFM) An exterior sign on a Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) store in Granada Hills, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM) is another retail stock, but this one is in the grocery arena. Grocery stocks are usually pretty solid choices, even in inflationary times, because you know sales will continue.\n\nSprouts, however, operates in a niche by focusing on natural and organic products rather than processed and packaged foods. It has over 400 stores in 23 U.S. states, with plans to open at least 10 new stores a year.\n\nEarnings in the third quarter came to $1.7 billion in revenue, with comparable store sales up 3.9% from a year ago. Sprouts also repurchased 831,000 shares at a price of $32 million, which helped drive the stock price higher.\n\nSprouts will report full-year earnings on Feb. 22, and I’m expecting another solid quarter. SFM stock is up 59% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSkyWest (SKYW) A close-up shot of a SkyWest (SKYW) plane.\n\nSource: Heather Dunbar / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyWest (NASDAQ:SKYW) is a Utah-based regional airline that operates a fleet of almost 500 aircraft. SkyWest serves 247 locations in North America thanks to its partnerships with major air carriers.\n\nThose fee-for-service partnerships with United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), among others, are important because they help give SkyWest a consistent income stream.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $752 million, up 10% from a year ago. SkyWest posted net income of $18 million, or 42 cents per share for the quarter.\n\nAnd it repurchased 1 million shares of stock at a price of $45 million in the quarter, adding to its 10.6 million shares repurchased in 2023.\n\nSKYW stock is up 188% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNRG Energy (NRG) Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nNRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is a Houston-based energy company that provides electricity and natural gas to 7.6 million residential and commercial customers.\n\nThe company generates 13 gigawatts of electricity, with most of that happening in Texas. Its brands include Reliant, Vivint, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Discount Power and more.\n\nEarnings for the third quarter were strong – NRG reported revenue of $7.9 billion, which was down from $8.5 billion a year ago. But the company’s operating income was much improved, coming in at $561 million versus $156 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company raised its Q4 2023 guidance from a range of $3.01 billion to $3.25 billion in adjusted EBITDA to a range of $3.15 billion to $3.3 billion.\n\nFor the full year 2024, NRG is projecting adjusted EBITDA in a range of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion.\n\nNRG also gives you the benefit of a dividend, with a yield of 3.1%. The stock is up 47% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is a blue-chip computer company that makes laptops, desktop computers, mobile devices and notebooks. In a crowded field, Dell has roughly 8.5% of the market share, placing it in third place among the competition.\n\nBut this old dog is learning a new trick. The company’s stock has been higher in the last year as investors are buying into Dell’s artificial intelligence plans. It operates a generative AI platform that helps its customers generate better predictions and analyze data.\n\nThanks to consumer interest in generative AI, Dell saw 9% growth in its server and networking revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Company officials say they expect that trend to continue into the next fiscal year.\n\nOverall earnings for the quarter included revenue of $22.2 billion, down 10% from a year ago. But net income was $1 billion and $1.36 per share, much better than a year ago when the company brought in $241 million and 33 cents per share.\n\nDELL stock is up 96% in the last year and also shows a dividend yield of 1.8%. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is playing catch-up in the generative AI game. But that’s OK. Even though Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) leapt to the forefront of generative AI and holds a lion’s share of the market, AMD is in a good place right now.\n\nAMD’s MI300 AI processors, which are set to compete directly with Nvidia, look to bring in big profits for AMD this year. The company increased its full-year processor revenue projections for 2024 from $2 billion to $3.5 billion. And interestingly, analysts like CFRA Research’s Angel Zino say that AMD is still likely being conservative with that estimate.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.1 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Net income of $667 million was a vast improvement from $21 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the full year, AMD reported revenue of $22.6 billion, down 4% from 2022. But now that the MI300 processors are in play, AMD should have a solid 2024 and will turn those full-year numbers around.\n\nAMD stock is up 101% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is on a hot streak. The ridesharing company recently posted its first annual profit. It announced a $7 billion stock buyback plan. And the stock appears poised for good things in 2024.\n\nUber has been a transformative company, disrupting the taxi industry and expanding into food delivery with its Uber Eats app. It also joined the S&P 500 in December, which further added to the demand for UBER stock.\n\nBut if you are a shareholder, you’re most excited about the idea that Uber is finally poised to turn a consistent profit. Its gross bookings jumped by 22% in the fourth quarter, and revenue was up 15% to $9.9 billion.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Uber is projecting gross bookings of $37 billion to $38.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.26 billion to $1.34 billion.\n\nUBER stock is up 118% in the last year, and it gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ANF and NVDA.

        "content": "*\n\nEuropean shares dip, S&P futures quiet with Wall St off\n\n*\n\nChina markets make modest gains on return from LNY holiday\n\n*\n\nGlobal bonds price for fewer, later rate cuts\n\n*\n\nNvidia results to test limits of AI euphoria\n\n(Adds quote in paragraph 4, recasts, updates prices throughout)\n\nBy Nell Mackenzie and Wayne Cole\n\nLONDON/SYDNEY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - World shares struggled to gain ground on Monday as fading chances for early interest rate cuts globally soured the mood and Chinese markets returned from holiday with only muted gains.\n\nA holiday for U.S. markets made for thin trading, while the latest surge in tech stocks is set to be tested by results from AI star Nvidia on Wednesday.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of world shares and Europe's broader index of stocks both lay flat around 1035 GMT.\n\n\"The mixed economic data released lately has put us in a transition period and we are waiting for the data to tell a consistent story,\" said James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities.\n\nA red-hot U.S. CPI print on Tuesday followed by another upside surprise in producer prices on Friday gave investors concern on persistent inflation, augmented by a weaker retail sales report, suggesting slower economic momentum. However, U.S. labour market numbers have continued to show jobs churning out at a strong clip and elevated wage growth.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei ended flat on Monday, pressured by chip-related shares following a slump in their U.S. counterparts late last week.\n\nChinese blue chips finished up just over 1%, enjoying tourism revenues during the Lunar New Year holiday which surged by 47% on a year earlier as more than 61 million rail trips were taken.\n\nThe country's central bank skipped a chance to cut rates again on Sunday, which will likely limit downward pressure on the yuan, but with deflation looming analysts see plenty of scope for further policy stimulus.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the United States as high readings on producer and consumer prices saw markets sharply scale back pricing for rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBruce Kasman, global head of economics at JPMorgan, warned the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of core personal consumption inflation could now jump by 0.5% in January. Only a week ago, markets were hoping for a rise of just 0.2%.\n\n\"While it is premature to place significant weight on noisy January data, risks have shifted in the direction that core inflation and labour market conditions both surprise the Fed in a hawkish direction in the first half of 2024,\" Kasman wrote in a note.\n\nFutures dropped, implying a 28% chance rates will be cut in May.\n\nHANGING ON NVIDIA\n\nThe surprise on inflation means the minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting out this week will now look dated, but any talk about the timing of potential cuts will be noted.\n\nThere are plenty of Fed speakers out this week to comment on the outlook, with Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller of particular interest.\n\nThe market sea change on rates saw two-year Treasury yields spike to a new 2024 high of 4.72% on Friday before steadying at 4.65%. Treasury futures were little changed on Monday with the cash market closed.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat, while Nasdaq futures added 0.22% helped by hopes Nvidia could somehow beat already stratospheric expectations.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has surged 46% so far this year and accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains. There is reason for optimism given that of the 80% of S&P 500 reporting so far, 75% have beaten forecasts.\n\nHigher bond yields were underpinning the dollar at 149.95 yen, though the threat of Bank of Japan intervention to prop up the yen has so far capped the currency pair at 150.88.\n\nThe dollar index was a touch firmer, while the euro was steady on the day at around $1.0774 .\n\nThe rise in yields took no shine off of non-yielding gold, which rose 0.3% to around $2,018 an ounce.\n\nOil prices were softer as concerns about demand tussled with the threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent slipped 76 cents to $82.71 a barrel, while U.S. crude for April fell 51 cents to $78.91 per barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie and Wayne Cole; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe, Sam Holmes, Shri Navaratnam and Susan Fenton)",

        "title": "Insider Insights: Does Intel CEO’s Recent INTC Buy Signal Strength Ahead?",
        "content": "What will it take to bring Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) back into the market’s favor? It would certainly build confidence if the company’s chief executive is also a shareholder. Even beyond that, the INTC stock outlook indicates improvement, albeit not perfection, so a small-sized allocation isn’t a terrible idea.\n\nWe’ve caught wind of discussion about whether Intel is the “next”Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). There’s no need to obsess over comparisons like this, though. Intel can make strides in 2024 even if it’s not in the same league as a juggernaut like Nvidia. All in all, Intel stock probably shouldn’t be everyone’s first-choice chip stock, but it still earns a respectable “B” grade.\n\nHow Much INTC Stock Did the CEO Buy?\n\nSome investors were disappointed with Intel after the company released its current-quarter guidance. Wall Street called for revenue of $14.2 billion, but Intel’s guidance range of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion fell short of the consensus estimate.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet, CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident in Intel’s growth prospects. In fact, Gelsinger reportedly bought 2,800 INTC stock shares through a trust for $119,700 on Feb. 1.\n\nPerhaps, Gelsinger envisions Intel making strides in the highly competitive AI-chip market. Currently, some analysts remain unconvinced. For example, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer feels that Intel’s AI offering is still in “prove-it” mode, while Needham analyst Hans Mosesmann warned, “AI everywhere seems like everywhere except Intel.”\n\nBut at least we can say that Gelsinger is putting his money where his mouth is. There are no guarantees, but it’s at least possible that Intel will show progress against its rivals in advancing the company’s AI-enabled chips.\n\nAI-PC Resurgence Could Help Intel\n\nIn early 2024, we can already see Intel facing challenges. Frustratingly, Intel is delaying the construction of its Ohio-based chip-manufacturing facilities. Whereas Intel’s previous timetable specified late 2025, now it appears that the construction won’t be completed until late 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot all the news is negative, however. Research firm Gartner envisions a potential catalyst for Intel\\ as rapid AI personal computer industry growth.\n\nAmazingly, Gartner estimates that smartphone manufacturers will ship out 240 million generative-AI smartphonesin 2024. The research firm expects vendors to ship out 54.5 million AI-enabled PCs this year.\n\nThis phenomenon could alter the PC landscape and revitalize the industry. Gartner Senior Director Analyst Ranjit Atwal explained, “The rapid adoption of on-device GenAI capabilities and AI processors will eventually become a standard requirement for technology vendors.”\n\nThis presents Intel with an opportunity to capitalize on a burgeoning niche market. Prospective investors should keep tabs on Intel for signs of progress in advancing and commercializing AI-PC chips. The company doesn’t need to be the “next Nvidia,” but Intel can at least capture market share wherever it’s possible.\n\nINTC Stock Outlook: Look for Improvement, Not Perfection\n\nOur INTC stock outlook doesn’t call for the same magnitude of gains that you should expect from a juggernaut like Nvidia. Investors should have realistic expectations and just look for signs of improvement with Intel.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Intel’s chief executive is also a shareholder. Plus, if there’s a revival in the PC market because of the AI-PC trend, Intel may capture some market share. Therefore, while it doesn’t deserve the same confidence level as Nvidia stock, we’re willing to give Intel stock a “B” grade.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "US markets are closed today for the Presidents Day holiday. However, investors will soon be treated to the quarterly earnings reports from the likes of AI leader Nvidia and retail powerhouse Walmart, which will be the focus as the December reporting season comes to a conclusion.\n\nTuesday 20th February: How did Walmart Fair Through the Holiday Season?\n\nWalmart Inc. is anticipated to report increased sales for the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 year, but experts predict lower profits and lower earnings per share from the holiday period.\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 report, the company is anticipated by Wall Street to show revenue of around $170.2 billion, a 6% YoY increase. Operational income is expected to grow 12% YoY for a rise of $6.761 billion, and the EPS is forecast to be $1.65, an 8% YoY rise.\n\nWalmart’s stock has been trading at record highs this month, at over $170 per share. The company announced in January that it will divide its shares three to one in order to lower the price and make them more affordable for staff members.\n\nWalmart reported a number of solid quarters in 2023, helped by increased sales of basic goods like food and fuel. Although recent credit card statistics looked encouraging for the store, Walmart’s recent gains will likely be slowed by reduced food costs and a downturn in general merchandise sales. Investors will be keenly observing Walmart’s comments about the current status of consumer spending.\n\nWalmart’s shares are up more than 6.90% since the beginning of the year. Daily Walmart Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\nTuesday 20th February: Will Home Depot Confound Expectations of a Disappointing Quarter?\n\nWhen Home Depot Inc. releases its most recent earnings report before the markets open on Tuesday, it is expected to reveal a decrease in both profit and revenue, weighed down by reduced sales volumes as consumers prioritize their spending.\n\nLast quarter, the company reported profits that were higher than expected, even though the company’s sales were down for the period. The company revised its full-year sales projections down by 3% to 4% due to weaker customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research reports that the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $2.76, based on predictions from 15 analysts. The EPS for the same quarter in the previous year was $3.3.\n\nHome Depot’s shares are up more than 5% since the beginning of the year. Daily Home Depot Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\nTuesday 20th February: Palo Alto Networks Looks Set For Strong Results\n\nBased on projections from 14 analysts, Zacks Investment Research reports that the average EPS estimate for Palo Alto for the quarter will be around $0.58, up from $0.34 in the same quarter last year. The company anticipates sales for the second quarter of its fiscal year in the range of $1.955–1.985 billion, indicating an 18–20% rise in revenue from the previous year.\n\nStrong momentum from transaction wins is likely what will have helped Palo Alto’s second-quarter results and boosted its top line. The robust demand for form factor hardware products—especially models driven by machine learning that provide enterprises zero-trust network security—is anticipated to have had a role in the quarter’s success.\n\nPalo Alto Networks’ shares are up more than 26.80% since the beginning of the year. Daily Palo Alto Networks Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\nWednesday 21st February: All Eyes on Nvidia\n\nAs the leading manufacturer of chips for artificial intelligence worldwide waits to report its earnings this Wednesday, investors are watching for a huge bump in the share price if the results are as promising as expected.\n\nSince January 1, Nvidia’s stock has increased by more than 46% due to excitement about AI’s potential for business. The $570 billion gain in market capitalization more than triples Intel’s market worth. Shares of Nvidia, whose processors are regarded as the gold standard in the AI business, increased by over 240% in 2023. The company last week also surpassed Alphabet, the parent firm of Google, to take the third spot as the most valuable US company.\n\nThe consensus expectation from 33 analysts is that Nvidia will report profits of $4.56 per share and an increase in quarterly sales to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year earlier.\n\nNvidia’s shares are up more than 50.70% since the beginning of the year. Daily Nvidia Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\nThursday 22nd February: Can Intuit Corp continue its steady growth on the back of AI?\n\nThe provider of tax and accounting software is expected to report its earnings on Thursday after the market closes.\n\nLast quarter revenues were $2.98 billion, up 15% over the previous year, whereby the top line supposedly benefited from significant increase in the Small Business and Self-employed division. The CEO at the time attributed its accelerated innovation across the global platform to a strategy involving greater use of AI and data.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce profits of $2.29 per share, representing a 4.09% increase over the prior year, and sales of $3.39 billion, representing an 11.36% increase over the same period last year.\n\nIntuit Corp’s shares are up more than 8.60% since the beginning of the year. Daily Intuit Corp Chart – Source: ActivTrader\n\nThursday 22nd February: Can Nestle still compete after price hikes?\n\nThe Swiss global food and beverage manufacturing company is scheduled to disclose financial results on Thursday before the bell.\n\nLate last year, the company reported lower-than-expected nine-month sales growth as increased product costs put buyers off, causing shares to fall, but the company expects volumes to turn positive again by the end of this year. At which point, the company confirmed their full-year 2023 projection of organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 17.0% to 17.5%. They also suggested that Earnings per share in constant currency were predicted to climb by 6%-10%.\n\nEarnings per share are expected to come in at 5.76, representing growth of 11.8% year over year, and a revenue estimate of $27.90 billion, up from $25.25 billion last quarter.\n\nNestle’s shares are down more than 2.15% since the beginning of the year.

        "title": "The \"Dean of Valuation\" Is Selling Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist. Should You?",
        "content": "Aswath Damodaran deserves his nickname of the \"Dean of Valuation.\" He teaches corporate finance and valuation at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Damodaran has written multiple papers and books on valuation, including The Little Book of Valuation targeted for a general audience. He also regularly provides data on corporate valuations on his website.\n\nAny list of the world's most prominent stock valuation experts will include Damodaran. When he thinks a stock is overvalued or undervalued, it's usually a good idea to pay attention. That's why it caught my eye when the \"Dean of Valuation\" recently revealed that he's selling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock hand over fist. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nDamodaran's assessment of the \"Seven Samurai\"\n\nDamodaran likes to refer to Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla as the \"Seven Samurai.\" They're more popularly known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Damadoran, though, thinks these stocks are akin to the characters in Akira Kurosawa's classic movie The Seven Samurai who save a village from bandits. In his view, the seven stocks \"saved investors from having back-to-back disastrous years in the stock market.\"\n\nIn a blog post earlier this month, Damodaran noted that investors who haven't owned at least some of these stocks over the last decade would have had a difficult task in beating the market. In 2012, the combined market caps of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks totaled $1.1 trillion. By the end of 2023, their combined market cap had soared to $12 trillion -- greater than all of the publicly traded stocks in China.\n\nNvidia has delivered the biggest gains of the \"Magnificent Seven\" by far. Over the last 10 years, the chipmaker's shares have skyrocketed by more than 165x. The stock has more than tripled in value over the last 12 months.\n\nDamodaran wrote that all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies \"qualify as very good to awesome, as businesses.\" However, he believes that only Meta and Tesla are close to being fairly valued while the rest are overvalued.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Damodaran thinks about Nvidia\n\nWith Nvidia's sizzling-hot returns, it's not surprising that Damodaran views the stock as the most overvalued of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" He recently posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as Twitter) that Nvidia \"is a bridge too far for me.\" Damodaran stated that he planned to sell half of his position in the stock.\n\nThe NYU professor isn't pessimistic about Nvidia's growth prospects, though. His valuation model assumed that the company will be able to increase its revenue by a compound annual growth rate of more than 32% over the next five years. Damodaran also projected that Nvidia will achieve an exceptional operating margin of 40%. He noted that he \"built in substantial value\" from artificial intelligence (AI) in his valuation of Nvidia.\n\nBut even with great expectations for Nvidia, Damodaran still thinks the stock is way overvalued. His model calculated a fair value for the stock of around $436. That's 40% below Nvidia's current share price.\n\nShould you sell Nvidia stock, too?\n\nI don't think that all investors should rush to the sidelines with Nvidia just because a prominent valuation expert is aggressively selling his shares. Damodaran acknowledged that his valuation analysis of Nvidia could be off if AI provides a significantly greater tailwind than he expects. I think that's a possibility.\n\nHe performed a similar valuation analysis of Nvidia last summer. Damodaran sold half of his position in the stock then, too. He left a lot of money on the table as a result.\n\nHowever, investors should take heed that Nvidia probably is priced for perfection. Any interruption in the company's remarkable growth would likely cause a major sell-off. In my view, though, a sharp decline in Nvidia's share price could also present a great buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks With More Upside to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year. It soared 239% as investors added shares to their portfolios in anticipation of a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending. That buying spree has continued in earnest this year, with Nvidia's stock advancing another 50%.\n\nThere are still plenty of reasons to own Nvidia. The company not only dominates the market for machine learning processors, but also participates in other parts of the AI economy, including networking equipment, subscription software, and cloud services. However, Wall Street currently sees more upside in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO), as detailed by the consensus price targets below:\n\nNvidia: $709.73 per share (implied downside of 3%) Amazon: $207.92 per share (implied upside of 23%) Docebo: $59.50 per share (implied upside 30%)\n\nThe most prudent way to benefit from AI is to buy a basket of stocks. Here's why investors should consider including Amazon and Docebo in their AI baskets.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is a multifaceted business with compelling growth prospects in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. It operates the most popular online marketplace in the world as measured by monthly visitors, and it continues to gain revenue share in North America and Western Europe. Moreover, while Alibaba currently leads the market in gross sales, Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to displace the company by 2027.\n\nBuilding on that, Amazon's strength in retail has evolved into a booming advertising business. Its unparalleled ability to engage shoppers and source data helps media buyers reach consumers with relevant campaigns. As a result, Amazon has steadily gained share in digital ad spending for several years, becoming the third-largest ad tech company, even as the leaders Alphabet and Meta Platforms have lost ground. Analysts at Insider Intelligence expect similar results in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services. Its 31% market share in the fourth quarter easily topped Microsoft's 24% market share and Alphabet's 11% market share, according to Synergy Research Group. That alone positions AWS as a probable beneficiary of AI, simply because cloud infrastructure is often the easiest way to run AI applications.\n\nHowever, consultancy Gartner  has also recognized AWS as a leader in artificial intelligence developer services, and the company recently bolstered its position in that market with Bedrock, a new service that helps developers build generative AI applications.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Retail e-commerce sales are projected to increase at 8% annually through 2030, while the ad tech and cloud computing markets are forecasted to grow at 14% annually. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth through the end of the decade, but its bottom line should increase more quickly as its high-margin businesses (i.e., advertising and cloud computing) account for more of total sales.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to grow at 30% annually over the next five years. In that context, Amazon's current valuation of 59 times earnings actually looks very reasonable. Patient investors should consider buying a small position in this stock today.\n\n2. Docebo\n\nDocebo provides a multi-product learning management system (LMS) that helps businesses create, deliver, and measure outcomes from training courses across internal (employee) and external (customer) audiences. One particularly innovative application is Docebo Shape. It uses generative AI to automate content creation, turning source material like corporate documents, presentations, and case studies into training material.\n\nFosway Group, a leading analyst of human resources technologies in Europe, has recognized Docebo as a leader in the LMS market for six straight years. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley selected Docebo as a top generative AI stock in 2024. In a note to clients, analysts at the firm said Docebo is (1) taking share from legacy vendors in internal LMS use cases and (2) leading the LMS market in external use cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Docebo is still advancing its generative AI capabilities. The company has announced new features coming to Shape this year, including virtual role-play with real-time feedback and an integrated copilot that further simplifies the creation of learning content. Management says, \"Shape will fundamentally change how training material is created and consumed.\"\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, LMS spending will increase by 20% annually through 2030, but Docebo's strong market presence should translate into above-average growth. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company to grow sales at 25% annually over the next five years. That consensus forecast makes its current valuation of 9 times sales look cheap, especially when the three-year average is 13.9 times sales.\n\nDocebo may not be a familiar name for many investors, but the company has a strong presence in the LMS market, and it's using generative AI to help customers more easily create learning material. That makes Docebo a worthwhile addition to a broader basket of AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "MORNING BID EUROPE-China markets look like they need another holiday",
        "content": "By Wayne Cole\n\nFeb 19 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole.\n\nHigh hopes China's markets would return from the break with a spring in their step have yet to be met, with modest gains for stocks so far.\n\nTourism revenues during the Lunar New Year holiday did surge by 47% on a year earlier as more than 61 million rail trips were taken, though the comparison was flattered by a particularly weak season last year.\n\nThe country's central bank skipped a chance to cut rates again on Sunday, which will likely limit downward pressure on the yuan, but with deflation looming, analysts see plenty of scope for further policy stimulus.\n\nChina's blue chip index added another 0.5% on top of its 6% pre-LNY rally. Yet that is still down 1% this year and 43% from the highs hit in 2021.\n\nIn contrast, Japan's Nikkei is up almost 15% for the year so far and paused just short of the all-time peaks hit back in 1989.\n\nEven after its surge the Nikkei is still only capitalised at 683 trillion yen ($4.55 trillion), about the same as Nvidia and Apple combined, and far below the S&P 500's $42 trillion.\n\nThe Nikkei's market cap is also not much more than the total cash held by Japanese companies, many of which trade at a discount to book value.\n\nSpeaking of Nvidia, the AI diva's results this week will be a test of its sky high valuations and a price to earnings ratio of no less than 96.\n\nThe chipmaker's $570 billion increase in market cap this year accounts for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's gains, so any disappointment would be a black eye for the whole index.\n\nOptions imply a risk the shares could swing 11%, or $200 billion, in either direction on the results.\n\nThen again Nvidia does have a very fat net profit margin of 42% and, as of October, a cash pile of $18 billion, so it can easily weather the vagaries of one result.\n\nIt is also riding the most powerful force in markets - momentum. Why is it going up? Because people are buying it. Why are people buying it? Because it's going up.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Europe, there is no major data today but flash PMIs will be important later in the week, along with business and consumer sentiment surveys. Analysts are counting on the European Central Bank survey of consumer inflation expectations to resume its downtrend after a slight uptick in November.\n\nThe ECB's wage data are also of note given how much policymakers have warned about high wage growth, even though it is a well known lagging indicator.\n\nThere are plenty of ECB speakers out and about, including President Christine Lagarde at a Eurogroup press conference on Friday.\n\nFederal Reserve speakers this week include the always influential Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Christopher Waller.\n\nThe Fed also releases on Wednesday minutes of its last meeting, though they have rather been overtaken by events given the high readings for consumer and producer prices.\n\nThere are ugly forecasts around that core PCE inflation could rise 0.5% in January, when markets had looked for only 0.2%.\n\nFed futures now only imply a 36% chance of a rate cut in May, when it was more than fully priced a couple of weeks ago. The market has less than 100 basis points inked in for the year, having taken out two quarter point cuts.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Monday:\n\n- No major European data, while U.S. markets are shut\n\n(By Wayne Cole; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

There is reason for optimism given that of the 80% of S&P 500 reporting so far, 75% have beaten forecasts.\n\nGoldman Sachs cited profits in the tech sector last week when it raised its year-end S&P 500 index target to 5,200, from 5,100.\n\n\"Our upgraded 2024 EPS forecast of $241 - 8% growth - stands above the median top-down strategist forecast of $235,\" said Goldman. \"We expect P/E valuation multiples will remain close to current levels, making earnings growth the primary driver of remaining upside this year.\"\n\nHigher bond yields were underpinning the dollar at 150.07 yen, though the threat of intervention has so far capped it at 150.88. The euro has also reached its highest so far this year on the yen at 161.95.\n\nThe single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.0784 , having met resistance just above $1.0800.\n\nThe rise in yields has been a burden for non-yielding gold, which was idling at $2,014 an ounce.\n\nOil prices were softer in early trade as concerns about demand tussled with the threat of supply disruptions in the Middle East.\n\nBrent slipped 32 cents to $83.15 a barrel, while U.S. crude for April fell 33 cents to $78.13 per barrel.\n\n(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes)",

        "content": "In this piece, we will look at the 15 best stocks for long-term growth. If you want to skip our introduction to the current drivers of stock market performance, then check out 5 Best Stocks For Long Term Growth.\n\nThe stock market in 2024 is characterized by a notably optimistic and forward-looking sentiment compared to the beginning of the previous year. Not only did the U.S. economy avoid tipping into recession, but stock markets also maintained their stability, defying expectations of a significant downturn. In fact, February 2024 witnessed the flagship S&P 500 index achieve a historic milestone by crossing the 5,000-point mark for the first time. This feat underscores the resilience and buoyancy of the stock market, highlighting investor confidence in the economic outlook. Additionally, the NASDAQ Composite, which is heavily influenced by the technology sector, approached its all-time high levels during the same period, further accentuating the positive sentiment in the market, albeit experiencing a slight pullback after the breakout.\n\nThe mention of \"AI\" among S&P 500 companies increased to 36% from 31% in the third quarter, with the information technology sector retaining its position as the sector with the most companies discussing AI. However, the energy sector experienced the largest increase in companies discussing this technology, as highlighted by David Kostin and his team of strategists at Goldman Sachs. In addition, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the blockbuster chipmaker prominently associated with AI, has witnessed remarkable growth, with its shares surging nearly 50% in the year, following a more than tripling in value in 2023. This surge has propelled NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, surpassing giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nWhen it comes to stock selection, targeting growth stocks is a common strategy for long-term investors seeking substantial returns. These stocks typically command higher share prices relative to their earnings per share, as they are expected to experience significant growth in the future. One key metric used to identify growth stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares the current share price to the company's earnings per share. A high P/E ratio, especially compared to industry benchmarks, suggests that investors are optimistic about the company's growth potential and are willing to pay a premium for its stock. This optimism is based on the expectation that the company will deliver strong earnings growth in the future, thereby justifying the higher price paid today.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking a long-term perspective on investment opportunities, growth stocks, particularly within the technology sector, showcase promising prospects. Among the noteworthy companies featured in our selection of the best stocks for long-term growth are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), and industry giants like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), among others. 15 Best Stocks For Long Term Growth\n\nA large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor the following list of the best long-term growth stocks to invest in, we compiled a list of stocks that recorded a P/E ratio greater than 50.

        "content": "NVIDIA\n\nScientists to Run State-of-the-Art Quantum Computing Simulations Using NVIDIA CUDA Quantum Platform, Turbocharged by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips\n\nAustralia’s Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre Australia’s Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre will add the NVIDIA CUDA Quantum platform accelerated by NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchips to its National Supercomputing and Quantum Computing Innovation Hub, furthering its work driving breakthroughs in quantum computing.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia, Feb. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCA2024 -- NVIDIA today announced that Australia’s Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre will add the NVIDIA® CUDA Quantum platform accelerated by NVIDIA Grace Hopper™ Superchips to its National Supercomputing and Quantum Computing Innovation Hub, furthering its work driving breakthroughs in quantum computing.\n\nResearchers at the Perth-based center will leverage CUDA Quantum — an open-source hybrid quantum computing platform that features powerful simulation tools, and capabilities to program hybrid CPU, GPU and QPU systems — as well as, the NVIDIA cuQuantum software development kit of optimized libraries and tools for accelerating quantum computing workflows.\n\nThe NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip — which combines the NVIDIA Grace CPU and Hopper GPU architectures — provides extreme performance to run high-fidelity and scalable quantum simulations on accelerators and seamlessly interface with future quantum hardware infrastructure.\n\n“High-performance simulation is essential for researchers to address the biggest challenges in quantum computing — from algorithm discovery and device design to the invention of powerful methods for error correction, calibration and control,” said Tim Costa, director of HPC and quantum computing at NVIDIA. “CUDA Quantum, together with the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip, allows innovators such as Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre to achieve these essential breakthroughs and accelerate the timeline to useful quantum-integrated supercomputing.”\n\n“Pawsey Supercomputing Centre’s research and test-bed facility is helping to advance scientific exploration for all of Australia as well as the world,” said Mark Stickells, executive director at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre. “NVIDIA’s CUDA Quantum platform will allow our scientists to push the boundaries of what’s possible in quantum computing research.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s national science agency, CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), estimates the domestic market opportunity from quantum computing to be worth $2.5 billion annually in revenue, with the potential to create 10,000 new jobs by 2040. Achieving this will require quantum computing to be embedded in other scientific domains, with applications in astronomy, life sciences, medicine, finance and more.\n\nPushing the Boundaries of Quantum Computing\r\nPawsey will deploy the system to run quantum workloads directly from traditional high performance computing systems, leveraging their processing power and developing hybrid algorithms that intelligently divide calculations into classical and quantum kernels, using the quantum device to improve computing efficiency. Quantum machine learning, chemistry simulations, image processing for radio astronomy, financial analysis, bioinformatics and specialized quantum simulators will be studied, starting with various quantum variational algorithms.\n\nPawsey is deploying eight NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip nodes based on NVIDIA MGX™ modular architecture. GH200 Superchips eliminate the need for a traditional CPU-to-GPU PCIe connection by combining an Arm-based NVIDIA Grace™ CPU with an NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU in the same package, using NVIDIA NVLink™-C2C chip interconnects.\n\nThis increases the bandwidth between GPU and CPU by 7x compared with the latest PCIe technology. It delivers up to 10x higher performance for applications running terabytes of data, giving quantum-classical researchers unprecedented power to solve the world’s most complex problems.\n\nPawsey is committed to making the NVIDIA Grace Hopper platform available to the Australian quantum community, as well as its international partners.\n\nAbout NVIDIA\r\nSince its founding in 1993, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.

        "title": "Nvidia Just Bought This Under-the-Radar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Should You Buy It, Too?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest semiconductor company. It's worth a whopping $1.8 trillion, and over $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone on the back of its next-generation data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nNow, Nvidia is spreading some of its newfound wealth across other areas of the AI industry. It filed a form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week, revealing the company held a number of investments in other AI companies.\n\nSoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) is one of them, and its stock soared 67% on the day Nvidia's investment was revealed. The company is worth just shy of $1 billion as of this writing, but its voice-based AI technologies are incredibly innovative and have the potential to create substantially more value. Here's why investors might want to follow Nvidia's lead and buy SoundHound AI stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoundHound is a leader in conversational AI\n\nYou might be familiar with the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI. It can answer complex questions and turn text-based prompts into blog posts, images, videos, and even computer code. SoundHound AI, on the other hand, develops conversational AI, which is designed to recognize voice-based prompts and respond in kind.\n\nSoundHound says its technology can process speech just like the human brain. It has enormous potential in consumer-facing applications, and some of the world's largest companies have already adopted it. Restaurant chains are using SoundHound to answer phones, automate drive-thru ordering, and assist employees with their routine tasks. Jersey Mike's, White Castle, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the restaurant giants using the technology.\n\nSoundHound also partnered with restaurant technology providers like Block's Square, Toast, and Olo. They have integrated conversational AI into their point-of-sale and ordering systems so customers can seamlessly use voice to make purchases. Those integrations are helping SoundHound rapidly expand into tens of thousands of new locations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAutomotive giants are also using SoundHound to create highly sophisticated in-car voice assistants. They can do everything from helping the driver navigate their vehicle's features to answering questions about the weather, sports results, and even local restaurant availability. Hyundai, Kia, and Stellantis (Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge) are just a few of the car manufacturers using SoundHound AI right now.\n\n2023 was SoundHound's biggest year ever\n\nSoundHound will report its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 in a few weeks. Wall Street analysts are forecasting $46.5 million in total revenue for the year, which would represent 49% growth compared to 2022.\n\nWhile it appears SoundHound is pulling in relatively modest sales for a $1 billion company, the company has amassed a whopping $341.7 million order backlog as Sept. 30, which it's currently working through. Those orders are expected to convert into revenue over time.\n\nPlus, SoundHound delivered just $6.7 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2023, yet management is guiding for $16 million to $20 million of revenue in the fourth quarter. The company is rapidly scaling.\n\nSoundHound AI isn't the only bet Nvidia recently made\n\nAccording to Nvidia's 13F filing for the fourth quarter of 2023, it purchased 1,730,883 shares in SoundHound AI. It doesn't specify what price Nvidia paid, but the position is worth $6.5 million at SoundHound's current stock price of $3.76.\n\nSoundHound wasn't the only stock Nvidia bought during Q4. It accumulated 1,960,784 shares in semiconductor designer Arm Holdings, which are worth over $260 million at the current price. Nvidia also bought a stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, worth $95 million at today's price.\n\nNano-X Imaging and Tusimple Holdings are the two other stocks Nvidia purchased.\n\nEach of these companies is using AI and autonomous technologies in some capacity.\n\nShould you follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock?\n\nNvidia's $6.5 million position doesn't say much about SoundHound's future potential. However, the fact Nvidia identified SoundHound amid a growing field of AI opportunities does make you wonder what the chip giant is seeing.\n\nFinancially speaking, SoundHound was on the brink of running out of money just a year ago, before it secured a $125 million loan facility from Atlas Credit Partners. SoundHound continues to lose money, but that cash infusion should be enough to see the company through the next 12 months (at least) assuming its losses don't grow any larger.\n\nIt does make SoundHound stock a relatively risky play, and it's no surprise it's incredibly volatile. Its 52-week low is $1.49 and its 52-week high is $5.11, which is a very wide spread.\n\nGenerative AI is a significant opportunity, and SoundHound has already amassed an impressive list of customers. Plus, its order backlog should result in strong revenue growth for at least the next couple of years. It might be worth following Nvidia's lead by taking a small position in SoundHound AI stock, but investors should brace themselves for a volatile ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in February",
        "content": "The returns of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have trounced the returns of the growth-centric Nasdaq Composite index over the last year, and they continue to do so in 2024. Year to date, the group has returned 12.4%, almost doubling the Nasdaq's returns, based on the performance of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.\n\nAmong this elite group of tech stocks, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are showing solid business growth and still offer upside from their recent highs. Here's why these two Magnificent Seven stocks remain solid picks right now.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia has been one of the best stocks to ride the growth in artificial intelligence (AI), as its share price soared by 239% over the last 12 months. The good news for investors late to the party is that its skyrocketing growth may have a while to play out. The stock remains attractively valued relative to its underlying business growth, and it's still one of the best AI stocks to buy for a few reasons.\n\nOne technique for getting a read on end-market demand for a company's products is to look at what other companies with adjacent businesses are reporting. Super Micro Computer makes plug-and-play rack systems for data centers, which include Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nSupermicro reported that its revenue grew 103% year over year in the most recent quarter as demand grew for AI rack solutions based on Nvidia's H100 chip. This was a massive acceleration over Supermicro's previous quarter and suggests demand for Nvidia's chips is not slowing down.\n\nAnalysts are raising their annual revenue estimates for Nvidia for the next few years, even though growth expectations were already sky-high for the GPU leader. The stock's modest valuation still makes Nvidia an attractive stock to buy. It currently trades at 35 times next year's consensus earnings estimate, which looks reasonable given Nvidia's robust growth.\n\nThere is $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure to fuel Nvidia's growth for a long time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe emergence of AI is forcing more companies to adopt accelerated computing and invest in GPUs, which is why Nvidia is seeing such tremendous growth. It generates $32 billion in trailing revenue from its data center segment, and given its estimated 80% market share in the AI chip market, it is well positioned to deliver more growth and returns for investors.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon is an incredibly strong business that has multiple revenue streams to drive returns for shareholders, including cloud services, advertising, and online retail sales. While its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, gets most of the attention on Wall Street, it's the company's improving growth in e-commerce that is driving the stock higher.\n\nSome might argue that AI technology could make it easier for consumers to search the web and find the products they want at other retailers, which could hurt Amazon in the long run. However, this underestimates the human tendency to stick with trusted brands. It also overlooks the investments Amazon is making in AI and infrastructure to improve its retail service.\n\nAmazon is in the process of boosting its delivery speed, which will make it more difficult for competitors to catch up. It said it achieved the fastest delivery speeds in its history in 2023, with over 7 billion units arriving the same or next day.\n\nOne benefit of faster delivery is more frequent shopping behavior. Amazon's online sales growth accelerated every quarter last year, but the company's profits are also up thanks to cost cuts and improved inventory efficiency. AMZN Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAI will only make Amazon's brand stronger. Many customers visit Amazon.com almost by default instead of searching for products on Google, and Amazon is about to push its value proposition further with the launch of Rufus, a new shopping assistant powered by generative AI.\n\nAmazon's improving shipping speed and opportunities to enhance the shopping experience with new AI tools will protect its competitive moat. Meanwhile, the stock still trades at a fair valuation of about 3.1 times trailing revenue, which is within its 10-year trading range. This means that as the company's e-commerce business recovers, the stock could deliver market-beating gains over the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This approach comes amidst broader economic concerns and an internal restructuring that included a 4% reduction in headcount.\n\nHowever, PEGA reported seeing significant revenue exceeding expectations due to outperformance in its subscription license segment. Also, tor 2024, the company’s guidance on revenue, EPS, and free cash flow has surpassed analysts’ expectations.\n\nUnderlining the bull case is that eight Wall Street analysts have given Pegasystems a moderate buy rating, with a consensus price target of $56.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) specializes in drug discovery with its AI and machine learning algorithms.\n\nThis year could be huge for RXRX because there are two major data readouts expected in the second half of the year. These include results from the phase 2 SYCAMORE trial for REC-994 and the phase 2/3 POPLAR study for REC-2282. These studies target cerebral cavernous malformation and Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), respectively, in areas with no approved drugs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile RXRX stock has had a negative free cash flow of $276 million over the past twelve months, the company reported a strong cash position with cash and cash equivalents totaling $389.5 million. This financial stability is increased by strategic partnerships, notably a $50 million investment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThere are several analyst price targets for the stock averaging $16.8, which implies a potential increase of 35.16% from the current price.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) offers advanced voice recognition and natural language understanding capabilities.\n\nLast year, the company announced targeted restructuring measures aimed at accelerating its path to profitability. This included an increased focus on its SaaS product, SoundHound for Restaurants. Also, the business reported a strong Q4 revenue, up 84% year over year (YOY).\n\nFor this year, SOUN plans to capitalize on a $160 billion total addressable market across its core industries. The company’s strategic focus includes enhancing its product offerings and leveraging its extensive blue-chip client roster, particularly in the automotive industry.\n\nAnalysts rate SOUN as a strong buy, with a 17.02% predicted upside for its stock price. Furthermore, analysts like Scott Buck from HC Wainwright & Co. are even more bullish, giving it a price target of $5, which is an upside of 32.98%. Further, forecasted revenue for next year is 72.24 million, with a predicted increase for its EPS.\n\nTherefore, in light of these recent financial results and projections, SOUN is one of those AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWelcome to the first theme change in markets for 2024.\n\nLet's call it, for argument's sake, the Great Reality Check.\n\nThe Great Reality Check has two components that lead to one conclusion for investors.\n\nComponent one is that we are stuck with sticky inflation at least through the first half of the year. That was confirmed in this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), both coming in above Wall Street estimates (notably the \"core\" readings).\n\nIt has also been confirmed by Corporate America, provided you are doing your daily due diligence.\n\nSo many companies have told the investing masses this earnings cycle that margins are still being hurt by high levels of inflation, including beverage giants PepsiCo (PEP) and Coca-Cola (KO), among others.\n\nThe second component is that the US economy is slowing down. Not falling off a cliff, but looking unlikely to spring a surprise upside in the near term.\n\nWhile Wall Street played down the soft retail sales report this week, I would push back and suggest consumers and businesses are growing more cautious.\n\nDiscretionary apparel companies VF Corp (VFC) and Levi's (LEVI) have laid eggs on earnings within the past two weeks.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) CEO Peter Kern told us on Yahoo Finance Live that travel demand in the first quarter has slowed, partially leading to his company's below-expected guidance last week. We got similar language from Airbnb (ABNB) on its earnings call this week and with its first quarter guidance.\n\nCisco (CSCO) said Thursday it would slash 5% of its workforce as it's seeing clients — such as telecom firms — delay new orders.\n\nElevator and escalator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS) told investors at a gathering at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that it projects new equipment sales to be flat to up low single digits in the \"medium term.\" (I will note Otis had a good investor day, outlining a new $8 billion capital return plan — more on that in my interview above with Otis chair and CEO Judy Marks.)\n\nStory continues In terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty... It's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations.\n\nOverall conclusion: Inflation is still on an upswing while economic growth is on a downswing, and Fed policy is caught in a vortex of being unable to cut rates to support growth acceleration.\n\nRemember it was just Jan. 1, 2024, when many on the Street thought March would bring the first of potentially six rate cuts this year.\n\nAnd there is your theme change, and why investors have reacted harshly to the inflation numbers. The mix of sticky inflation, slowing economic growth, and uncertain Fed policy will add volatility to both equities and fixed income markets.\n\n\"A solid economy should continue to support earnings growth, but higher rates will likely also serve to cap valuation expansion,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said in a client note.\n\nSome basics questions to be asking right now:\n\nIs this the start of a market correction? If so, how should I be preparing my portfolio of investments? Is this all overblown and I should not make any drastic changes to my portfolio? How can I develop a diversified portfolio that withstands the inevitable market volatility in 2024? Are we getting a sampling of how the market will be reacting as Election Day gets closer?\n\nOf course, Nvidia (NVDA) could come out next week with earnings and blow everyone away, sending broader markets higher. In the meantime, the data is telling us things have changed — and it should be respected.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter/X @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Stock Split",
        "content": "The stock market is red-hot. The S&P 500 crossed 5,000 for the first time ever; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is making new all-time highs regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite, the most tech-heavy of the major indexes, is riding a wave of artificial intelligence (AI) optimism right into the stratosphere. Over the last 12 months, that index is up 33%.\n\nWith so many new highs being made, some stock prices have reached towering heights. So let's talk stock splits and cover three stocks -- SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) -- that are ready. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe hottest AI stock around looks primed for a first-ever split\n\nJake Lerch (Super Micro Computer): If I had to pick one stock as the mascot for the current bull market, it just might be Super Micro Computer. Its shares generated a mind-blowing total return of 774% in the last 12 months.\n\nTo put that in context, it's taken Microsoft (which is no slouch regarding stock performance) the last eight years to generate a similar total return.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's rapid rise has seen its stock price shoot up from around $86 a share to over $880. That, my friends, is a recipe for a stock split. The company has never conducted a stock split in its 17 years as a public company. However, with its stock price closing in on $900 a share and investor interest surging, it might be time. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company's near-term prospects look spectacular as the AI revolution drives up demand for its off-the-shelf server racks -- one of the primary building blocks for AI data centers. The company reported exceptional earnings results a few weeks ago, lifted its full-year guidance, and provided highly upbeat commentary in a post-earnings conference call.\n\nIn short, given the stock's amazing run, now could be the right time for Super Micro Computer to perform its first stock split -- a development many investors would cheer.\n\nAI chip dominance has taken this stock's share price into the clouds\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): Amid the generative AI boom, Nvidia has been on a tear. Over the last year, the stock has risen almost 240% as demand for chips designed for AI workloads has boomed. That took the share price to around $740 per share as of the time of this writing.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoincidentally, that places its price near where Nvidia last executed a 4-for-1 stock split, in July 2021, with the stock up nearly 300% since then.\n\nAlong with the company's current stock price, Nvidia's market positioning and growth appear to make a case for another split. It has an estimated 85% market share in the high-end AI chip market, according to an analyst at RaymondJames. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a compound annual growth rate of 38% for the AI chip market through 2032.\n\nGiven such numbers, it should come as little surprise that its revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29) rose 206% yearly to more than $18 billion. With that, the gross margin surged to 74% versus 54% in the year-ago quarter, when operating expenses rose by 16%.\n\nConsequently, Nvidia's net income of over $9.2 billion rose by nearly 14 times! Amid such increases, its P/E ratio of 97 has not deterred investors from bidding the stock higher.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia may have another less discussed reason for wanting a split. At a market cap of $1.8 trillion, it has arguably become the market's most essential semiconductor stock. A lower nominal share price would make it a leading candidate for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, and Nvidia's addition would add to its prestige and investor interest, serving as yet another positive catalyst.\n\nIndeed, when it comes to semiconductor stocks, none appears better positioned than Nvidia. And with its continuing growth prospects and history, a stock split could make it more appealing to prospective buyers and indexes alike.\n\nA stock split could potentially keep Meta's red-hot momentum going\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): In late 2022, when shares were just $89, most investors probably didn't have a possible stock split for MetaPlatforms on their bingo cards. But Wall Street will soon wrap up Q1 of 2024, and the stock is quickly running toward $500. This epic comeback is no fluke. The stock on fire since overcoming adversity in its advertising business and cutting expenses to get its profits back on track.\n\nLost in the stock's ups and downs were two consistent truths. First, Meta's three-headed monster of social media apps, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, never stopped growing. Monthly active users rose from 3.71 billion in Q3 of 2022, when the stock bottomed, to 3.98 billion today. That doesn't seem like much, but half the world's population is on these apps, and Meta's audience is still rising at a meaningful pace.\n\nSecond, Meta has continually invested in building computing systems for the company's long-term AI ambitions. Meta is already using AI to grow its advertising business, and the consumer-facing nature of Meta's apps gives the company tons of room for innovation over time.\n\nStock splits don't change a company's fundamental valuation. Fortunately, Meta's forward P/E of 23 is attractive if the business delivers the 20% annualized earnings growth analysts expect. If Meta does split its stock, the numbers make it a stock split you can confidently buy and hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Chase Coleman Has 46% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Chase Coleman is one of Wall Street's original whiz kids. When he was just 24 years old, he founded Tiger Global Management with starting capital from his former boss and mentor, the iconic hedge fund manager Julian Robertson, Jr.\n\nColeman parlayed this seed money of $25 million into one of the world's most successful hedge fund empires, with roughly $58 billion in assets under management. He's currently ranked as the world's 500th richest person by Forbes with a net worth estimated at $5.7 billion.\n\nColeman is best known for spotting big winners early on, making notable investments in (among others) Spotify; Facebook, now Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META); and LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nHe's no stranger to bold bets, so it isn't surprising that to close out 2023, Coleman had a whopping 45.8% of Tiger Global Management's equity portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms: 18.8% Microsoft: 14.3% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 5.3% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 3.4%\n\nLet's look at Coleman's top holdings to see why he's so heavily weighted in these AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is Coleman's largest holding by far, which isn't surprising since he discovered the company when it was still Facebook.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Meta has a long track record of using sophisticated algorithms to its advantage. The lion's share of its revenue is generated by digital advertising, and using AI helps surface more relevant ads and appropriate content for its social media users.\n\nWith the ongoing recovery in ad spending, 2023 was a banner year for the world's second-largest digital advertiser. Meta helped fuel its growth by providing advertisers with a suite of AI-powered tools to help improve their results.\n\nThe company also jumped feet first into generative AI by developing a top-shelf AI model -- the LLaMA (large language model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud platforms, giving Meta an entirely new revenue stream. The social media company also announced its first-ever dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta stock sells for about 23 times forward earnings, a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Coleman's investing decision.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft stunned tech aficionados last year when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, focusing the limelight on the potential applications for generative AI. Many big tech companies followed suit, and the AI arms race was on.\n\nMicrosoft made the most of its investment, quickly integrating AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its most popular productivity tools. It further bolstered demand by offering the most sought-after AI models on its Azure Cloud.\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities, however, rests in its suite of AI-fueled assistants: Microsoft Copilot. The ability of these tools to increase users' productivity has resulted in strong demand, which could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027, according to the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the fourth quarter, and Microsoft noted that 6 percentage points of that growth came from increased demand for AI services.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades for 35 times forward earnings. That's a slight premium to the overall market, but the company's strong history of growth and the additional potential resulting from AI make it a must-own AI stock, which likely provided extra incentive for Coleman to buy.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon also has a long history of deploying AI algorithms to manage its e-commerce business, using AI to make product recommendations, manage inventory levels, schedule delivery routes, and more.\n\nThe company has also jumped on the generative AI bandwagon, using the technology to improve product descriptions, summarize reviews, and polish merchant advertising. Amazon also plans to offer a customer-focused tool to answer specific product questions.\n\nFurthermore, as the leading cloud infrastructure provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a laundry list of popular generative AI models via its Bedrock AI. The company is also several generations along in the development of its AI processors -- namely Inferentia and Trainium -- to provide improved and lower-cost AI processing for its cloud customers.\n\nDespite its run-up over the past year, Amazon stock sells for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an undervalued stock, which likely didn't escape Coleman's notice.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nLike its rival Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the vast majority of its revenue from its ad tech business, driven by Google search. Alphabet has a long and distinguished history of using AI to improve its search and targeted advertising results, and the rebound in the digital advertising market will no doubt boost its fortunes.\n\nAlphabet has been hard at work developing generative AI solutions, incorporating this next-generation functionality into a broad cross-section of its namesake Google and Android products and services.\n\nIts position as a leading cloud infrastructure provider puts the company in the perfect position to market AI solutions to its cloud clients. The recent debut of Gemini AI was hailed by Google as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\"\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI platform offers a growing suite of more than 130 foundational AI models for customers to choose from.\n\nOne of the most intriguing things about Alphabet's stock is the price: just 25 times earnings, a discount to the broader market -- and a valuation that Coleman likely couldn't pass up.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the poster child for the accelerating adoption of AI. Its processors revolutionized the gaming industry and were adapted to handle the rigors of AI and have since become the gold standard.\n\nIts graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market in machine learning and data centers, with an estimated 95% share in each market. This made Nvidia the no-brainer choice when demand for generative AI ramped up.\n\nWhile rivals are working furiously to develop competing chips, Nvidia's pace of innovation makes it difficult to gain ground. Further frustrating those efforts is the company's heavy spending on research and development, which amounted to $6.2 billion -- or 16% of total revenue -- for the nine months ended Oct. 29.\n\nDespite the stock's triple-digit gains, Nvidia is still incredibly cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock -- and Coleman was no doubt keenly aware of that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why I Might Change My Mind and Buy Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Over the past year, there have been few better stocks to own than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), as it's up 400% since the start of 2023. And year to date, it's already up nearly 50%.\n\nUnfortunately, I missed those gains after selling my shares last July. However, it's never too late to admit you're wrong and consider buying back in. But at its current stock price, many people might question this decision. So, why am I considering buying now? Read on to find out.\n\nNvidia's growth has been unparalleled\n\nNvidia's primary products are GPUs (graphics processing units). This piece of computing hardware is tailor-made to handle complex computing tasks. Originally designed to process gaming graphics, its uses have been expanded to tasks like drug discovery, engineering simulations, mining cryptocurrency, and training AI models.\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the latest demand driver for Nvidia, and its results are spectacular. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 30), revenue rose an incredible 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. But the company isn't done as management expects fourth-quarter revenue to more than triple year over year to about $20 billion. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nGrowth of this magnitude at a company as large as Nvidia is almost unparalleled, making the stock such an incredible story. Recently, Nvidia surpassed Amazon and Alphabet as the third-largest U.S. company by market cap.\n\nAfter missing out on much of the stock's meteoric rise, I believe now is the time to correct that mistake.\n\nThe stock is expensive, but it will look cheaper soon\n\nLooking back on last year, I realize I misjudged the market opportunity for Nvidia's products. I figured that once the initial onslaught of AI-driven GPU demand was over, revenue would fall off a cliff. This is exactly what happened in 2019 and 2022 when the cryptocurrency market crashed and demand for GPUs dropped.\n\nI still believe this drop will happen, but it won't occur nearly as quickly as I expected. The demand for Nvidia's GPUs is unbelievable. Take Tesla, for example. After they spent $300 million on its Dojo computer filled with 10,000 H100 GPUs, I figured that would be the only one they'd build.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Tesla announced it would spend another $500 million on a second Dojo computer powered by Nvidia GPUs at its Buffalo, NY, plant. CEO Elon Musk also mentioned on the company's Q4 conference call that they have plans for additional Dojo computers beyond that.\n\nClearly, the demand is greater than I anticipated, and I want to get back in on that, especially since it will be a multiyear trend. Precedence Research estimates the global GPU market will reach about $773 billion in 2032, up from $42 billion in 2022. With Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue total of $45 billion, it has a significant foothold in this growing market.\n\nBut is now really the best time? It isn't as I should've done this months ago, but it's never too late to flip your stance on a generational company. Many investors overlooked Amazon or Netflix in the early years but still made a lot of money off those stocks despite being late to the party.\n\nNvidia is likely to offer a similar opportunity today, assuming you can stomach the stock's price tag, which trades for nearly 100 times earnings. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nBut when looking forward with analysts' earnings projections over the next 12 months, the valuation is much more palatable. Microsoft trades at a comparable 35 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nWhile my position in Nvidia will likely be fairly small to start, it will be enough skin in the game to monitor the company and ensure I'm capturing the gains of what's looking to be one of the most important companies this decade. While I've missed the first big move, there's room for much more upside if the AI market is as massive as some predict.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Arm Holdings the Next Nvidia After Smashing Earnings Estimates?",
        "content": "There is only one Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the world's unequivocal leader in high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs) and data center hardware and software powering large swaths of the economy and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). But several companies are also doing incredible things, like Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM).\n\nArm's stock is up over 100% in February (as of Feb. 12), as shown below, but many investors aren't familiar with the company. I'll discuss what Arm does, its financials, and its stock below.\n\nWhat does Arm Holdings do?\n\nFirst, here is what Arm does not do. Arm does not actually make any semiconductors (or \"chips\"). Arm sells the \"architecture\" for companies like Nvidia, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM), and Samsung(OTC: SSNL.F). The list goes on, but you get the idea. I can almost guarantee that you used an Arm-based product today because 99% of all smartphones have CPUs built with Arm technology. Here's how it works.\n\nArm designs the specifications for chips that are energy-efficient, high-powered, and meet its customers' specifications for the end market. The company buys the design from Arm (saving millions or billions on research and development) and pays Arm a license fee. Then, it pays Arm a royalty fee for each unit sold. As of Arm's most recent quarter, 280 billion units have shipped since its inception, including 7.7 billion in the quarter.\n\nBecause of the low-power, high-performance nature of Arm chips, Apple replaced Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) chips in its Macs with Arm-based chips, and Arm is used by Amazon Web Services (AWS)(NASDAQ: AMZN) server chips. Arm's superior technology is exciting investors as it increases its adoption, including in growing markets like Automotive.\n\nIs Arm Holdings stock a buy?\n\nArm stock is not without risks. The company receives 20% of its revenue from China. This creates geopolitical headaches. The industry is highly competitive, and Arm is exposed to economic slowdowns because it generates more than half of its sales from mobile phones and consumer electronics. But results are encouraging.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal revenue was $824 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 14% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Operating income was $338 million on an impressive 41% margin. Arm also has an enviable business model. Since it doesn't make the chips, its capital expenditures (equipment purchases) are very low, creating more free cash flow (FCF). Thirty cents of every revenue dollar went into the company's pocket last quarter.\n\nWhat really excited investors last quarter probably wasn't the 14% increase in sales, though. It was the $2.4 billion remaining performance obligation, as shown below. Source: Arm.\n\nRPO is similar to a backlog. It represents contracts signed that will produce revenue in future quarters. RPO was up 38% YOY last quarter, building on the significant jump in the fiscal second quarter. This is clear evidence of increased adoption of Arm technology.\n\nArm stock experienced a meteoric rise after third-quarter earnings, pushing the valuation metrics off the charts. Its price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios stand at 124 and 52, respectively. Compare this to high-flying Nvidia's 40 and 35, and you can see that Arm stock will probably return to Earth soon. Investors should be cautious about buying at this level while looking for a better entry point. Arm has a tremendous future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will be looking at the 25 most valuable semiconductor companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global semiconductor industry, you can go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Semiconductor Companies in the World.\n\nSemiconductor Industry: Key Insights\n\nAccording to a report by Deloitte, 2023 was a tumultuous year for the semiconductor industry as it experienced sales declining by 9.4% to $520 billion. This was the seventh downturn the industry went through since 1990. The situation was expected to be much worse, however, many semiconductor companies had stronger second and third quarters. 2024 is anticipated to be a better year with global sales predicted to reach $588 billion and surpass the record revenues of 2022, $574 billion.\n\nThe memory chip market had the worst drop in sales in 2023, 31%. It was the most significantly impacted segment of the semiconductor industry. The rest of the industry only went through a steady 3% decline in sales in 2023. In end markets, PC and smartphone sales are expected to grow by 4% in 2024 after going through a downward slump in 2023. Communication and computer chip sales, including data center chips, remain crucial, constituting 56% of overall semiconductor sales in 2022. High inventory levels and declining fab utilization pose challenges for the industry. Inventory levels remained high at over $60 billion in fall 2023. Fab utilization also remained high during the recent shortage.\n\nMajor Players In The Semiconductor Industry\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSMC), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are some of the most prominent names in the semiconductor industry.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an American semiconductor company. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is based in Santa Clara, California. It is a leading provider of graphics processing units and application programming interfaces. On February 6, the company announced a partnership with Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO). The partnership aims to provide AI infrastructure solutions for data centers by equipping enterprises with the computing power necessary for success in the AI era. Cisco's networking expertise and NVIDIA's GPU technology combined would enable them to deliver secure and scalable Ethernet-based infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSMC) is a Taiwan-based semiconductor company founded in 1987. The company is also a notable supplier of artificial intelligence hardware and software. On February 6, the company announced further investment in Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc. (JASM). Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation (SSS), DENSO Corporation, and Toyota Motor Corporation are also investing in JASM. JASM is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited's (NYSE:TSMC) majority-owned manufacturing subsidiary in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, which aims to build a second fab, scheduled to start operations by the end of 2027. The investment is expected to create over 3,400 high-tech professional jobs.\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a notable semiconductor company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. On December 7, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $11.06, beating estimates by $0.1. The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 4.09% and amounted to $9.3 billion, ahead of market consensus by $18.97 million. As of February 15, the company has surged nearly 50.56% over the past six months. Here are some comments from the company's earnings call:\n\n\"In our fiscal Q4 2023, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while infrastructure software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue, driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators, represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion.\"\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a booming industry with prominent companies competing to meet to growing demand. We have made a list of the most valuable semiconductor companies in the world. 25 Most Valuable Semiconductor Companies In The World\n\n25 Most Valuable Semiconductor Companies In The World\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most valuable semiconductor companies in the world, we went over several sources including industry reports, our own rankings, and multiple similar rankings. We also scanned the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. For public companies, we checked each company's market capitalization, as of February 15, 2024, on Yahoo Finance. The market caps for foreign companies were converted to US dollars based on the exchange rates of the respective country. To quantify the \"value\" or \"size\" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, or the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. Since no private company made it to our list, we have ranked the most valuable semiconductor companies in the world in ascending order of their market capitalization, as of February 15.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest technology trends right now, and investors broadly are looking to invest in companies that could win big from this tech. That's natural, as AI has the ability to transform multiple industries and contribute significantly to the global economy over the next decade and beyond.\n\nAccording to a forecast from Bloomberg Intelligence, the generative AI market could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in revenue in 2032, accounting for 12% of all tech spending in that year. That would be a massive jump over this year's estimate of $137 billion in generative AI spending. With that outlook in mind, now would be a good time for investors to buy and hold shares of solid companies that are positioned to capitalize on the looming growth of this lucrative market.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) are already taking advantage of this huge opportunity. While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical hardware for training and powering large language models (LLMs), Palantir is helping customers integrate AI into their operations and use it to improve productivity with its software platform.\n\nHere's why investors should consider buying these two AI stocks and holding them for the next decade.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe demand for chips capable of powering AI applications is set to soar big time in the coming decade. According to Allied Market Research, the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of roughly $384 billion in 2032 as compared to just $15 billion in 2022. Nvidia currently has about a 90% share of the AI chip market, which puts it in a solid position to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nThe good part is that Nvidia is already witnessing eye-popping growth. The company will release its fiscal 2024 results next week, and analysts are expecting it to report that its revenue increased 119% to $59 billion. What's more, Nvidia's earnings are expected to jump from $3.34 per share in fiscal 2023 to $12.33 in fiscal 2024 thanks to the tremendous pricing power it enjoys in AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia's business is expected to grow at a healthy rate. That's evident from the chart below, which also shows that analysts have been raising their growth expectations. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAgain, Nvidia's earnings are forecast to increase at an astounding compound annual rate of 102% over the next five years. All this explains why Nvidia is one of the top AI stocks you could buy right now, especially considering that the company is moving quickly to ensure that it remains the top player in this market.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia updated its product roadmap last year to stay ahead of its competitors. It will be releasing updated AI chips every year instead of following a two-year cycle. That schedule could help Nvidia maintain its impressive share of the AI chip market. And now, reports suggest that Nvidia is looking to make custom AI chips as well.\n\nReuters reports that Nvidia is bringing up a new business unit to make bespoke AI chips for cloud infrastructure service providers and others. Though the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been so strong that would-be customers may have to wait for as long as a year to get their hands on them, some companies have also been developing custom chips internally to tackle specific AI-related workloads. Moving into this market is going to open another lucrative revenue opportunity for Nvidia; the custom chip market was worth an estimated $30 billion last year.\n\nIn all, it can be said that Nvidia could remain the top AI semiconductor pick over the next decade considering the potential growth on offer and the company's current market share. Also, Nvidia trades at 35 times forward earnings, which is a discount to its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 42. As such, investors would do well to buy it right now -- its sunny AI prospects could lead to healthy gains over the next decade.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nWhile Nvidia is one of the best ways to tap the AI hardware market, Palantir Technologies gives investors an opportunity to benefit from the software side of things. Market research provider Precedence Research predicts that the AI software market could generate a whopping $1 trillion in revenue in 2032. To hit that would require it to clock a compound annual growth rate of almost 23% over the next decade.\n\nMarket research firm IDC ranked Palantir No. 1 in the global AI software platform market in 2021 in terms of both market share and revenue. The company's latest results indicate that the AI software opportunity will soon start driving meaningful growth.\n\nWhile Palantir's revenue in Q4 2023 was up 20% year over year to $608 million, its commercial business grew by 32% to $284 million. The faster growth of the commercial business was a result of the growing adoption of Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) by customers.\n\nPalantir witnessed a 44% year-over-year increase in the number of commercial customers last quarter. What's more, the adoption of AIP helped Palantir close 103 deals worth over $1 million last quarter -- twice as many as in the prior-year period. \"The demand is off the charts for AIP, with bootcamps as the delivery mechanism for AIP, and we're seeing AIP drive the expanding addressable market, that we're seeing,\" said Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer Ryan Taylor on the latest earnings conference call.\n\nSo Palantir could be at the beginning of a huge growth curve. Certain analysts assert that the company may be sitting on a potential revenue opportunity of $1 trillion in the AI software space. Analysts' consensus forecast is that Palantir's earnings will increase at a compound annual rate of 85% for the next five years.\n\nConsidering the huge end-market opportunity the company is sitting on, it could sustain impressive levels of growth for a longer period and deliver healthy gains over the next decade, which is why investors should consider buying this tech stock before it flies higher following its terrific gains in the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "12 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best breakout stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe stock market in 2024 is more optimistic and forward looking than it was at the start of last year. Back then, investors were fretting about the state of the U.S. economy and the impact that high interest rates from the Federal Reserve would have on it. Yet, as 2023 demonstrated, and much to everyone's surprise, neither did the U.S. economy tip into recession and nor did the stock markets fall and wipe out wealth.\n\nInstead, AI prevailed everywhere as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other big ticket technology names soared after OpenAI's ChatGPT convinced the world that A.I. now roams among us.\n\nIn fact, February 2024 is the first time in its history that the flagship S&P 500 index has crossed 5,000 points. As if this weren't enough, the month has also seen the NASDAQ Composite, dominated by the technology industry, near its all time high levels before paring back the breakout. At the heart of this stunning performance is, you guessed it, A.I. The start of the year has seen industry bigwigs the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) chief Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, NVIDIA boss Jensen Huang, and of course, OpenAI's eccentric Sam Altman all take the stage and reaffirm their optimism for the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nIt was Zuckerberg who got the ball rolling, as he shared his firm's plans for buying hundreds of thousands of GPUs from NVIDIA this year in order to beef up Meta's computational capacity. Since we'll be talking about breakout stocks in this piece, Meta is particularly important as far as 2024 is concerned. This is because its shares have shown the classic trait of a sudden breakout in the wake of a catalyst. While the Meta chief's GPU comments were nevertheless welcome, the true surge in the firm's shares came after its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023. This report saw the firm report a surprise dividend of 50 cents. Since the earnings report, Meta's shares are up by 18%, making it a classical example of a breakout stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, when we talk about breakout stocks in the A.I. era, the crown is still firmly placed on NVIDIA and Mr. Huang's head. NVIDIA's shares are already up by 49.9% year to date in a blistering set of results that saw NVIDIA briefly become more valuable than big ticket technology stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nSimilarly, another breakout stock that has soared recently is also related to artificial intelligence and also has a close relationship with NVIDIA. This stock is none other than the British semiconductor design house Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM). Arm is one of the youngest entrants on the stock market, and before its shares were publicly listed, NVIDIA was on its way to buy the firm before regulators marred the plans. Well, the decision to go public seems to have served Arm well, since it's a breakout stock that is now up by 145% since its IPO.\n\nSo why is Arm soaring? Well, all the company had to do was to convince investors that there were A.I. related orders down in the pipeline, and off the shares went. Arm's latest earnings call saw plenty of AI mentions, with the management commenting:\n\nFrom the most complex devices on the planet for training and inference, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 to edge devices such as the Gemini Nano Pixel 6 from Google or the Samsung Galaxy S24, more and more AI is running on more end devices, and that's all running on Arm. And what that has done is driven a very strong set of tailwinds for our licensing growth. When we look at demand for new products from a licensing standpoint, what we are finding from the end market is that we've reached nowhere near good enough relative to the capability of the technology, and end customers for new designs are needing more and more Arm technology to keep up, particularly with the AI demands.\n\nLooking at these trends, it appears that the gods of the stock market are plenty favorable when it comes to breakout stocks. Therefore, we made a list of some such stocks today and the top picks are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). 12 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best breakout stocks, we ranked the holdings of the IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

        "title": "Nvidia Could Be About to Counter a Big Artificial Intelligence (AI) Threat With This Move",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the dominant force in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) graphics cards, with an estimated 92% market share. This is the reason the company has been growing at a terrific pace, up 230% over the past year.\n\nHowever, the company faces a potential threat from some tech giants. Let's examine that threat before checking how Nvidia is reportedly going to take care of it.\n\nCustom AI chips pose a threat to Nvidia\n\nWhile companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet are Nvidia's customers and have spent billions of dollars on its graphics processing units (GPUs), it's no secret they have been developing custom AI chips to reduce their reliance on the graphics-card specialist.\n\nAlphabet, for instance, has deployed custom AI accelerators known as tensor processing units (TPUs) in Google Cloud to \"scale cost-efficiently for a wide range of AI workloads, spanning training, fine-tuning, and inference.\" Similarly, Meta Platforms is expected to deploy a new custom AI chip this year in a bid to reduce its dependence on Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft has built custom AI chips for deployment in its Azure data centers, and they're expected to hit the market this year. Meanwhile, Amazon revealed its own chips for training AI models in November, making them available for use by Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud customers.\n\nThere are two reasons these tech giants have been developing chips in-house. First, Nvidia has been unable to keep up with the massive demand for its AI GPUs. The waiting period for the company's flagship H100 AI graphics card can reportedly stretch up to a year.\n\nNvidia is trying its best to increase the supply of its graphics cards with the help of its foundry partners, but customers may not be comfortable waiting for so long to get their hands on these chips.\n\nSecond, Nvidia's AI GPUs are very expensive. The H100 processor reportedly carries a price tag between $30,000 and $40,000. However, investment banking firm Raymond James estimates that it costs Nvidia just over $3,300 to manufacture one H100 GPU, pointing toward the immense pricing power the company enjoys in this market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo it's not surprising to see tech giants looking to cut down on such massive spending by developing custom chips internally to tackle specific AI workloads for which an H100 may not be required.\n\nFormally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), these custom chips are dedicated entirely to performing specific operations rapidly while being energy efficient. Semiconductor research group SemiAnalysis reportedly estimates that a successfully developed custom AI chip could help Nvidia's customers save hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAll this tells us why Nvidia may be looking to enter the custom AI chip market.\n\nNvidia wouldn't want to let go of this potentially $55 billion revenue opportunity\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Marvell Technology(NASDAQ: MRVL) are two leading manufacturers of ASICs, and both companies have witnessed a sharp jump in AI-related orders. Marvell, for instance, could generate $1 billion in revenue from selling custom AI chips this fiscal year. Broadcom, on the other hand, is expected to sell custom AI chips worth $8 billion to $9 billion in 2024, according to one estimate. These two companies together control a 47% share of the ASIC market.\n\nInvestment banking firm Needham estimates that the overall custom chip market was worth an estimated $30 billion last year. AI is already commanding a significant chunk of this space as sales of high-end custom ASICs reportedly stood between $13 billion and $18 billion last year. Morgan Stanley predicts that ASICs could account for 30% of the $182 billion AI chip market by 2027, pointing to a potential revenue opportunity of $55 billion in this space.\n\nA Feb. 9 Reuters exclusive says that a former Marvell executive is heading Nvidia's custom chip division, and the GPU specialist has already held discussions with Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Google to make custom chips for them.\n\nIf the Reuters report about Nvidia entering the custom AI chip space turns out to be true, investors will have another solid reason to buy this fast-growing AI stock. It's currently trading at an attractive 35 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 42.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Worried About an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Bubble? Consider This Billionaire Investor's Advice.",
        "content": "If you think artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are starting to look frothy, you're not the only one.\n\nThere's plenty of commentary online about a bubble forming in AI stocks, and it's not surprising investors would think that. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), a maker of CPU chips prized for their efficiency in AI applications, jumped as much as 42% on Monday following a 48% gain last Thursday on a strong earnings report.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers and storage equipment that work well for running AI models, is up 169% year to date, and shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the flagship for the generative AI revolution, are up 46% this year after more than tripling last year.\n\nThere's certainly some evidence that a bubble -- an irrational surge in the price of an asset that eventually leads to a crash -- is forming in AI stocks, as some of the gains in some of these stocks have been divorced from any meaningful change in fundamentals.\n\nIn other words, there's a lot of hype, but that also means opportunity for investors, as volatility represents an opportunity to make money. If you think the rapid surge in AI stock prices is a warning sign for investors, you might want to consider the advice of George Soros, the billionaire investor and chairman of Soros Fund Management who is one of the most successful investors ever. By some accounts, his Quantum fund, with $39.6 billion, was the most successful hedge fund in history. Among other things, Soros is known for making $1 billion in a single day by shorting the British pound in 1992. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGeorge Soros' approach to stock market bubbles\n\nBack in 2009, Soros famously said, \"When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire. That is not irrational.\"\n\nSoros has also said that there's a \"two-way reflexive connection between perception and reality which can give rise to initially self-reinforcing but eventually self-defeating boom-bust processes, or bubbles.\" That explains much of the psychology that is driving AI stocks higher. These companies are delivering strong results and benefiting from the AI boom, but investors are also attracted to a momentum rally, believing that these stocks will continue to go up.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoros' approach has made him aggressive when he believes he's right. As fellow billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said, \"As far as Soros is concerned, when you're right on something, you can't own enough.\"\n\nBut if there is an AI bubble, Soros doesn't seem to be following his own advice, at least as of Sept. 30 when his fund's holdings were last reported. The Soros Fund bought 17.4 million shares of Arm in the third quarter but sold all of its Nvidia and Microsoft shares, dumping 10,000 shares of each, a sign that it may believe that gains in those stocks were exhausted. The fund also bought puts on the Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the Nasdaq-100, implying a bet on the top tech stocks falling, though that may have just been for hedging reasons.\n\nIs there an AI stock bubble?\n\nIt's easy to spot the sudden gains in stocks like Nvidia and Supermicro and conclude that an asset bubble is forming, but the results from these stocks indicate that these gains aren't undeserved. Nvidia, for example, reported that revenue more than tripled in its third-quarter earnings report, and profits jumped by 12 times. It's clear from those numbers that Nvidia's business is surging along with the stock. In fact, the stock's price-to-earnings valuation has come down over the last year as earnings growth has outpaced the stock price's growth.\n\nIt's also clear that Wall Street analysts have underestimated demand for essential AI infrastructure like Nvidia's chips as Nvidia has regularly soared past Wall Street estimates. Similarly, Supermicro stock has soared since its preliminary earnings report in January was well ahead of the analyst consensus as well. The recent surge in Arm shares has also come as emerging AI demand makes it likely that analysts are significantly underestimating future earnings.\n\nAI stock investors should be wary of a bubble forming and should keep an eye on these stocks and others, making sure that the results from the businesses justify the gains, but it also seems that at this stage, momentum in the AI hardware sector is still building.

        "title": "Could Broadcom Become the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) became the world's first trillion-dollar chipmaker in 2023, and it's now worth $1.8 trillion. That marks a whopping gain of 1,810% in just five years. Nvidia's historic run was fueled by the rapid growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which sparked brisk sales of its high-end data center GPUs for processing AI tasks.\n\nNvidia's multibagger gains are impressive, but could Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) -- which rallied nearly 350% over the past five years and is worth about $590 billion -- follow its lead and become the next hot chipmaker by the end of the decade? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe differences between Broadcom and Nvidia\n\nBroadcom is a more diversified company than Nvidia. Its chipmaking business produces a wide range of wireless, networking, optical, data storage, and industrial chips. Its software segment provides infrastructure, cloud, and cybersecurity services.\n\nIn fiscal 2023 (which ended last November), Broadcom generated 79% of its revenue from its chipmaking business and 21% from its software division. It also generated a fifth of its total revenue from Apple, which holds a multiyear agreement to purchase its wireless, radio frequency, and mobile chips.\n\nBroadcom might seem too dependent on the cyclical chipmaking market and Apple's orders, but it expects its recent acquisition of cloud giant VMware to expand its software segment to account for about half of its top line. Like Nvidia, Broadcom also expects the secular expansion of the generative AI market -- which was responsible for 20% of its semiconductor revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 -- to fuel its long-term growth.\n\nNvidia's business model is simpler than Broadcom's. In its latest quarter, it generated 80% of its revenue from its high-growth data center division. Its gaming GPU business accounted for 16% of its revenue, while 4% came from professional visualization, automotive, and OEM chips. Nvidia develops higher-end chips than Broadcom, but they're both \"fabless\" chipmakers that outsource their production to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom isn't growing as fast as Nvidia\n\nToday's Broadcom was actually called Avago Technologies until 2016. That's the year Avago acquired the original Broadcom and inherited its more well-established brand.\n\nBefore buying Broadcom, Avago repeatedly grew through big acquisitions. As the \"new\" Broadcom, it continued to expand inorganically by buying CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security unit, and VMware to construct its software business.\n\nBroadcom's organic growth and ongoing acquisitions enabled it to increase its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2023. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 21%. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to climb at CAGRs of 19% and 18%, respectively, as it integrates VMware and continues to expand its chipmaking and software divisions.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia grew its revenue and adjusted EPS at a faster CAGR of 21% and 23%, respectively, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last January). From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to increase at a CAGR of 61% and 133%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand.\n\nBut Broadcom is still a great growth stock\n\nWe should take all of those estimates with a grain of salt, but Nvidia should grow much faster than Broadcom for the foreseeable future. Broadcom also seems more dedicated to generating stable double-digit revenue and earnings growth from its diversified portfolio instead of chasing breakneck expansion from a smaller selection of chips like Nvidia.\n\nThat said, Broadcom could still become a trillion-dollar chipmaker by the end of the decade if it simply maintains its current valuation and growth rates. Its stock looks reasonably valued today at just 27 times forward earnings -- and if it maintains that multiple, matches analysts' estimates, and increases its earnings at a stable CAGR of 15% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, its market cap could easily exceed $1.2 trillion by the final year.\n\nTherefore, Broadcom might not ever attract as much attention as Nvidia, but it's still one of the few promising chipmakers that has a shot at following Nvidia's lead into the four-comma club.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) investing world is quite large. There are multiple ways to invest in the trend, from hardware to software to application plays. Each of these segments has advantages and drawbacks. Still, two of the most popular ways to invest in AI from the hardware and software perspective are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), respectively.\n\nBut of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out.\n\nThe companies are different types of AI investments\n\nNvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units) are the building blocks of AI computing. GPUs are great at processing complex computing loads like training an AI model. With Nvidia's GPUs often perceived as best-in-class, it has become the go-to company for GPUs slated for AI use.\n\nPalantir's software was originally designed for the government to take in loads of data and deliver actionable insights. Its software has since expanded to commercial use, although government revenue still makes up most of its business. Palantir's software is highly adaptable and can be tailored to meet a variety of needs, whether it's a hospital, insurance, or manufacturing company.\n\nThe two markets these two serve are completely different, as are the rest of their attributes.\n\nTheir revenue types are different\n\nBecause Nvidia is a hardware company, its revenue stream isn't recurring. It needs to sell additional GPUs to grow its business, and if the demand isn't there, then Nvidia's revenue could suffer.\n\nPalantir's software model requires its customers to renew within a predetermined time frame (often annual or monthly), and clients must pay a fee to continue using Palantir's product.\n\nSo, if a recession strikes, Nvidia's revenue streams will likely come under pressure as customers may choose to delay some of its projects. Conversely, if Palantir's software is highly integrated into a client's systems, they likely have no choice but to continue paying Palantir.\n\nStory continues\n\nWinner: Palantir\n\nNvidia is growing at a faster pace\n\nWhen considering outright growth, Nvidia is far superior to Palantir. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 (ended Oct. 30), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year compared to Palantir's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 (ended Dec. 31) growth of 20%.\n\nWhile Nvidia's growth far outpaces Palalntir's, Palantir is still growing at a respectable rate for a software company.\n\nWinner: Nvidia\n\nBoth companies are profitable\n\nUnlike many growth companies, Palantir knows how to turn a profit. In Q4, it posted a 15% profit margin. PLTR Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nPalantir's profit margins have steadily risen over the past few years, and it isn't done yet. However, Nvidia's profit margins are far superior to Palantir's since it is a mature business. NVDA Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIf Nvidia goes through another downturn due to demand depletion, don't be surprised if Nvidia's margins drop below Palantir's. But for right now, Nvidia is far ahead of Palantir in this measure.\n\nWinner: Nvidia\n\nNvidia and Palantir are difficult to compare from a valuation basis\n\nBecause Palantir hasn't reached maximum profitability, using a valuation measure like a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is problematic, so a revenue-based measure like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is often used. Likewise, a mature company like Nvidia shouldn't be using the P/S ratio; instead, it should use the P/E ratio.\n\nAs a result, comparing these two head-to-head is difficult. So, we'll have to compare them to their peers.\n\nAt 25 times sales, Palantir is a very expensive stock. But it's not in unprecedented territory. Peers like CrowdStrike, Snowflake, and Cloudflare all trade in this range, but their revenue growth rates are in the 30% year-over-year range instead of 20% for Palantir. As a result, Palantir can be considered as an incredibly expensive stock.\n\nNvidia's price-to-earnings ratio hasn't improved, as it trades for nearly 100 times earnings. But when forward earnings are utilized (which factor in the next 12 months of growth), Nvidia's stock doesn't look as expensive, as it trades for 35 times forward earnings. With peers like Microsoft and Apple trading at 35 and 28 times forward earnings, Nvidia's price tag doesn't look as bad, especially when its warp-speed growth rate is considered.\n\nWith Nvidia being more closely valued by its peers than Palantir, it wins this round.\n\nWinner: Nvidia\n\nThe verdict\n\nAt a final score of three to one, Nvidia beats out Palantir. But, the one category Palantir did win (revenue type) could cause it to become a better stock in all four areas if Nvidia hits a demand slump.\n\nBut as of right now, Nvidia looks like the better buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now and Hold for a Decade or Longer",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been on fire ever since ChatGPT was launched in late 2022. Since then, a slew of new generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications have made cutting-edge graphics processing units that can handle accelerated applications a hot commodity. As Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leader in that subset of the chip market, its sales and stock price have been rocketing higher.\n\nAfter watching Nvidia's share price rise by 222% during the 12-month period that ended Wednesday, some investors are justifiably nervous that the stock has gotten too far ahead of itself.\n\nNvidia will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb 21. During its fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 29, total revenue surged 206% year over year.\n\nIts valuation of about 97 times trailing earnings isn't unreasonable if you assume continued growth at its present rate. However, the semiconductor industry is famously cyclical. Demand for chips that can power generative AI applications will eventually crash. We just don't know when that crash will come. If you buy Nvidia at this inflated valuation and the bottom falls out next year, you could suffer heavy losses.\n\nFor most folks who missed the boat on Nvidia, climbing aboard now entails more risk than they can tolerate. If you want to hitch your portfolio to a major player in the AI revolution with significantly less risk, consider buying shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) now to hold for the long run.\n\nAlphabet's AI prowess is better than you think\n\nThe AI gold rush started when OpenAI launched ChatGPT about a year and a half ago. By that time, though, Alphabet had already been an AI-first company for several years. In a 2016 blog post, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told everyone that \"in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available.\"\n\nIf it didn't have an army of engineers skilled in the arts of machine learning, Google wouldn't be able to recognize poor spelling in search queries or rank search results properly. With AI working behind the scenes to provide better results, Google has captured a 91.5% share of the global search market, according to Statcounter. Microsoft, a tech giant currently worth over $3 trillion, launched Bing nearly 15 years ago, but it still has just 3.4% of the global market for search.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Maps has over a billion monthly users, and millions of businesses eagerly use the platform to attract new customers. Maps is another AI-heavy application -- it wouldn't be able to forecast traffic or recommend improved routes without the contributions of some of the AI industry's most valuable talent.\n\nWhy Alphabet is well positioned for AI's next chapter\n\nIn addition to a search business that dominates its competitors, Alphabet is a leading provider of cloud computing services. Late last year, its cloud offering became a lot more valuable with the addition of Gemini.\n\nOpenAI caught Alphabet flatfooted when it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. In a nutshell, Gemini offers a similar generative AI experience for consumers with the chatbot formerly known as Bard. Gemini also gives enterprise-sized Google Cloud customers a chance to build AI applications of their own.\n\nWith several applications that boast over a billion active users per month, Google can offer enterprise-level cloud customers access to reams of real-world data they won't find anywhere else. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA fair price\n\nGoogle Cloud sales rose 26% year over year in the third quarter. With a large addressable market and an advantage over competitors who don't dominate the markets for search and location data, investors can reasonably expect strong growth from its cloud business for another decade.\n\nThe vast majority of Alphabet's revenues and profits still come from Google Services. This segment is growing more slowly than its cloud business, but it's still a long way from stagnation. Google Services revenue rose 12.5% year over year in the fourth quarter. Over the same time frame, operating income from the services segment jumped 32%.\n\nWith advantages over the competition, and its two main operating segments growing by double-digit percentages, Alphabet should be valued at a high earnings multiple -- but it isn't. You can buy the stock for around 21 times forward earnings expectations.\n\nThere's no such thing as a risk-free growth stock. With reliable earnings from advertising and cloud services, though, buying Alphabet at a reasonable valuation gives you an excellent chance to come out ahead over the long run. With its firm toehold in the rapidly evolving AI space, it also has a chance to become a top performer. Buying some shares now to hold for the long run looks like a smart move.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How OpenAI's Sam Altman And Nvidia's Jensen Huang Think A.I. Should Be Regulated",
        "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Getty Images\n\nAt the center of today’s buzzing scene of artificial intelligence are two companies, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Nvidia (NVDA), which supplies the vast majority of computing chips to application developers like OpenAI. While both companies benefit hugely from the A.I. hype, their CEOs are advocates of global governance and setting guardrails in the rapidly advancing technology.\n\nAt the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman proposed a regulatory sandbox approach, which encourages experimentation with A.I. and then “see what makes sense and what doesn’t and then write the regulation around that,” Altman said in an onstage interview with H.E. Omar Al Olama, the UAE Minister for A.I., on Feb. 13.\n\nIn the past year, OpenAI has become synonymous with the A.I. industry as a whole, as its flagship products ChatGPT, Dall-E and Sora, a text-to-video generator launched yesterday (Feb. 15), have exposed the world to A.I.’s advanced capabilities.\n\nAltman said every country is looking to create its own regulatory environment and, at some point, a single global framework would be required to ensure countries are on the same page about the deployment and uses of A.I. An example already in practice is the International Atomic Energy Agency, an organization formed “to decide what will happen with the most powerful of these systems,” Altman said.\n\nAltman hinted at the possibility of open-sourcing previous iterations of OpenAI’s models, such as GPT-3, as OpenAI has already done with GPT-2, to foster collaborative innovation.\n\nCountries need to establish “sovereign A.I.”\n\nAlso speaking at the event was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company’s market cap exceeded $1 trillion last year. He called on countries to develop what he described as “sovereign A.I.”\n\n“This is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,” Huang said in an onstage fireside chat with Minister Al Olama on Feb. 12. “Every country needs to own the production of their intelligence.” Emphasizing the importance of each country owning its data, Huang described, “[your data] codifies your culture, your society’s intelligence, your history. Therefore, you must take your data, refine it, and create your own national intelligence.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nvidia CEO emphasized the diverse applications of A.I. across multiple domains, from biology and physics to robotics, highlighting the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and ethical standards in A.I.-driven industries. “We have to develop the technology safely, we have to apply the technology safely, and we have to help people use the technology safely,” he said. “Whether it’s the plane that I came in, cars or medicine, all of these industries are heavily regulated today.”\n\nAs countries around the world navigate using A.I. to empower their growth, Altman and Huang emphasized the role of regulation in shaping the industry’s future.\n\nAlready, China and Brazil have proposed drafts to regulate A.I. in specific use cases, while Israel and Japan have instituted clarifications to protect consumer data based on existing laws. Italy, which instituted a temporary ChatGPT ban over data concerns last March, is also further exploring regulations to protect consumer privacy.In the U.S., 52 percent of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about A.I. Much discussion has taken place about protecting artists and writers whose work is used to train A.I. models, allowing consumers to unknowingly use copyrighted work without giving credits to their original creators. Additionally, much scrutiny has come on tech companies for the emergence of deepfakes and the potential misinformation A.I. could fuel in the coming election season.\n\nWhile regulation is important, Huang and Altman both believe democratizing A.I. will unleash a new chapter in human creativity. For example, every person can interact with A.I. today without the barrier of learning how to code, as the language of computers has “become human,” Huang said.\n\nAltman echoed, “If you think of everybody on Earth getting the resources of a company hundreds of thousands of really competent people—an A.I. programmer, an A.I. lawyer, an A.I. marketer, A.I. strategist, and not just one of those but many of each, and you get to decide how you want to use that to create whatever you want to create, the creative power of humanity with tools like that should be remarkable.”\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\n'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning What to Watch on Streaming This Week: February 16-22 Who Is Astrid Buffett, Warren Buffett's Wife Who Balks at $4 Sun Valley Coffee? 13 Hilariously Savage Donald Trump Valentine's Day Memes Elon Musk Launched His Red Tesla Roadster Into Space 6 Years Ago—Where Is It Now?\n\nRead the original story How OpenAI's Sam Altman And Nvidia's Jensen Huang Think A.I.

One, Nano-X Imaging Ltd., saw its shares double over two days, adding some $400 million in market value to the medical-devices maker.\n\nHow Nvidia came to hold about $380,000 worth of its shares, though, is not likely what investors expect.\n\nBack in 2017, Nvidia reported a stake in Zebra Medical, an Israeli-based startup focused on using artificial intelligence to read medical images. Four years later, Nano-X acquired Zebra in an all-stock deal. That resulted in Nvidia’s receiving shares in Nano-X in return for its Zebra stake.\n\n“The market is presuming that Nvidia consciously purchased” the stake in Nano-X, John Hempton, chief investment officer at Bronte Capital Management, wrote in a post on Substack Thursday. “Nvidia did not consciously choose to buy Nano-X stock.”\n\nNano-X shares fell as much as 5.2% in postmarket trading after closing with a gain of 36% on Friday.\n\nThe chipmaker made the disclosures in a 13-F regulatory filing, required for institutional investors whose portfolios exceed $100 million.

        "title": "High-flying Nvidia’s earnings could test US stock market’s AI dreams",
        "content": "By David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Next week’s earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia could prove a gut check for one of the market’s hottest names, and for the artificial intelligence fever that has helped power gains for U.S. stocks in recent months.\n\nExcitement over the business potential of AI has boosted Nvidia’s shares by more than 46% since Jan. 1. Its $570 billion increase in market capitalization is more than triple the market value of Intel. Shares of Nvidia, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, surged nearly 240% in 2023.\n\nThe chipmaker's gains have accounted for more than a quarter of the S&P 500's increase this year. The benchmark index is up nearly 5% year-to-date, after optimism about AI helped drive the index up 24% in 2023.\n\nNow the third most valuable company on Wall Street after Apple and Microsoft, Nvidia has also become a bellwether for the artificial intelligence industry. Other AI-focused stocks have surged this year, including Super Micro Computer Inc, which is up 182% year-to-date, and Arm Holdings, up nearly 71%.\n\n\"When people say that the market is doing well this year, they really mean that tech is doing well, and Nvidia is at the core of that,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. \"There is excitement within AI and if that optimism is not fulfilled by earnings then you could see that reverberate quickly and weigh on sentiment.\"\n\nNvidia will release quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Wall Street expects earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.\n\nGiven the company's size and its importance to the AI story, Nvidia’s results could be pivotal for market sentiment, said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Capital.\n\n\"Every time you get a big stock market rally there’s a favorite stock that leads it,\" said Landis, who regrets selling his shares in Nvidia last year. \"It's hard not to look at Nvidia and see … that's driving the psychology of the overall market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly, traders are bracing for big moves in the company’s shares. Nvidia options are pricing a swing of about 11% in either direction following its results, according to data from options analytics service ORATS.\n\nThat's the largest expected move options traders have priced ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS data showed.\n\nTom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said positive updates to Nvidia's corporate outlook could fuel more AI optimism and extend a market rally that has been concentrated in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is a member.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms, another member of the group, have surged 34% this year while Apple’s have fallen by 5%. Shares of Tesla have tumbled nearly 20% after the electric car maker warned of \"notably lower\" sales growth this year and shrinking margins.\n\n\"Right now investors are rewarding visibility into earnings growth and that keys up well for more gains for Nvidia,\" Hainlin said.\n\nOn the other hand, investors may use a less-than-stellar report as an opportunity to take profits.\n\nRyuta Makino, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, believes investor enthusiasm for Nvidia is so high that its shares could fall by at least 10% if the company simply meets expectations, without exceeding them.\n\nHe remains bullish on Nvidia due to rising capital expenditures from customers such as Amazon.com and Microsoft into their cloud businesses, which rely on the company’s chips.\n\nA disappointing report from Nvidia could also exacerbate concerns over crowding in the market’s largest stocks, said Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.\n\nOverall, investors have their highest allocation to the tech sector since August 2020, according to fund managers in the latest survey conducted by BofA Global Research.\n\n\"This is the pillar of the growth for the index today, but at some point the gas tank will go empty,\" Purves said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)",

It is a holiday shortened week with markets closed for the President's Day holiday. Another huge week though on the earnings front. NVIDIA, Walmart, Home Depot, Berkshire Hathaway, and Warner Brothers Discovery, they are all reporting earnings next week.\n\nAll eyes, of course, will be on NVIDIA, Wednesday after the close, the last of the Magnificent Seven to report this earnings season. Stock is on a tear up almost 50% to start the year. And ahead of that, Dow component Walmart is reporting Tuesday before the open, the stock hitting an all time high on Friday ahead of that announcement.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Turning to the economy, a somewhat quiet week on the economic calendar. On Thursday, we will get the weekly reading on jobless claims, and a January reading on existing home sales. On top of that, we'll get the monthly PMI report. Economists forecasting both services and manufacturing PMIs will decline.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And lastly, we'll have more commentary from Fed officials, as well as minutes from the January FOMC meeting. This coming after comments Friday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, saying that three rate cuts in 2024, is a quote, \"Reasonable baseline.\"",

        "title": "U.S. Cellular (USM) Q4 Earnings Beat Despite Lower Revenues",
        "content": "United States Cellular Corporation USM reported strong fourth-quarter 2023 results, with both the bottom line and top line surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. A reduction in prepaid and postpaid retail connections led to a revenue decline year over year. However solid momentum in fixed wireless portfolio, growth in tower rental revenues partially supported the top line. Cost optimization strategy improved profitability. Growth in postpaid average revenues per user (ARPU) and steady progress in 5G network deployment are tailwinds.\n\nNet Income\n\nNet income in the quarter was $15 million or 16 cents per share against a loss of $28 million or a loss of 33 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents. Lower operating expenses led to a higher net income during the quarter.\r\n\r\nNet income in 2023 was $54 million or 63 cents, up from $30 million or 35 cents reported in 2022.\n\nUnited States Cellular Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUnited States Cellular Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | United States Cellular Corporation Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nThe company generated $1 billion in operating revenues compared with $1.04 billion in the prior-year quarter. Net sales were negatively affected by a decline in postpaid and prepaid retail connections. However, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $30 million.\r\n\r\nService revenues decreased to $755 million from $774 million in the prior-year quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753.57 million. Equipment sales registered $245 million in revenues compared with $274 million in the prior-year quarter. Net sales beat the Zack Consensus Estimate of $216.64 million.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the company reported total operating revenues of $3.9 billion down from $4.16 billion in 2022.\r\n\r\nFixed wireless customers grew by 46% year over year to 114,000. Tower business witnessed healthy momentum during the quarter and registered revenues of $25.1 million. Management’s effort to diversify its third-party customer base is a positive factor.\r\n\r\nHandset connections were 80,000 compared to 105,000 in the year-ago quarter. Handset churn rate was 1.22%, compared to 1.12% a year ago. Connected devices remained stagnant year over year at 49,000 and the churn rate increased to 3.03% from 2.99% a year ago. Total prepaid connections stood at 451,000, down from 493,000 in the year-earlier quarter.\r\n\r\nPostpaid average revenues per account improved to $131.63 from $130.97 in the year-ago quarter, with postpaid churn rate of 1.44% and 1.35%, respectively. Postpaid ARPU rose to $51.61 from $50.60 a year ago. Prepaid ARPU was $32.32, down from $33.34 in the prior-year quarter. The prepaid churn rate decreased to 3.87% from 4.11% recorded in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuarterly Details\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter stood at $233 million, up from $202 million in the prior-year quarter. The 16% year over year growth was induced by various cost optimization initiatives. Adjusted OIBDA rose 19% year over year to $194 million.\r\n\r\nTotal operating expenses declined to $979 million, down 9% year over year. Consequently, operating income rose to $21 million against an operating loss of $27 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the December quarter, U.S. Cellular generated $148 million of cash from operating activities compared with $180 million cash generated in the year-ago quarter. In 2023, the company generated $866 million cash from operations compared to $832 million cash generated in 2022.\r\n\r\nAs of Dec 31, 2023, the company had $150 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.04 billion in long-term debt compared to respective figures of $273 million and $3.18 billion in 2022.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor 2024, U.S. Cellular anticipated service revenues in the range of $2,950-$3,050 million. Adjusted OIBDA is estimated within the range of $750-$850 million. The company expects adjusted EBITDA guidance at about $920-$1,020 million and capital expenditure is projected in the band of $550-$650 million.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nUnited Cellular currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%.

        "title": "3 Top Tech Stocks Poised for Continued Success in 2024",
        "content": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index was one of the best-performing exchanges in 2023. Just six weeks into 2024, it may be headed for a repeat performance. The index is up approximately 7% and the story is the same for the top tech stocks. That means a focus on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nIn 2023, companies made a point of telling investors about their AI capabilities. In 2024, investors are being more discerning about AI. Specifically, they want to know how companies are going to use AI to increase profits.\n\nThat narrows the list a little bit. But as the early returns show, there are still several companies to choose from. Here are three of the top tech stocks that have posted strong returns in the last 12 months. However, each has a believable AI story that is likely to propel their stocks higher in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) posted solid earnings in early February. The results included a 20% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase and the fourth consecutive profitable quarter. And that growth isn’t expected to slow down anytime soon.\n\nPLTR stock is up 40% in 2024 and 160% in the last 12 months. So, it’s not like it needed much help from bullish earnings. And there are many analysts saying the time may come for a pullback.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I agree. I tend to take a long-term outlook based on fundamentals. However, after each of its last two earnings reports, PLTR stock has had a pullback of around 15-20%. Will lightning strike a third time? Possibly, but it shouldn’t be something that concerns long-term investors.\n\nThat’s because Palantir continues to silence its critics. First, it didn’t have any commercial clients. Now it has over 20 major partners including companies AWS and Google Cloud. Palantir increased its commercial revenue by 70% year-over-year and is guiding for 40% growth in its commercial sector this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the reason for that is what the company calls unprecedented demand for its artificial intelligence platform. Maintaining that demand will be the key to justifying the company’s eye-popping valuation which appears to be the next objection for the company to overcome.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou could easily put Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on a list of top tech stocks, but Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) may be a (slightly) better option for 2024. The reason comes down to supply and demand. Nvidia simply can’t meet the insatiable demand for its AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD recently released its own MI100 AI chips. At launch, the company projected $2 billion in sales for the year. However, on the earnings call, CEO Lisa Siu increased the forecast to $3.5 billion, and analysts believe that may be too conservative.\n\nAlthough AMD stock is nearing the top of its current consensus price target. But the key word there is current. Analysts have been increasing their price targets since the earnings report and if the company keeps capturing market share fueled by increasing demand, it’s not hard to see the stock flirting with a $200 price target by the end of the year. As it is, AMD stock is finding solid support around $168 since the earnings report.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity makes this list of top tech stocks for the way it showcases both sides of the AI coin. On the one hand, artificial intelligence will create more ways for bad actors to try to breach protected information. On the other hand, companies like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) are using AI as part of its cybersecurity platform as an extra layer of protection.\n\nThe question investors have to ask is how much is that worth? Revenue and earnings are growing strongly YOY. And about $3 billion of that revenue was of the recurring variety that shareholders love. But with a stock price that’s up 180% in the last 12 months and 30% so far in 2024, it’s fair to ask if all that growth is priced in.\n\nHowever, the company is getting ready to report earnings on March 5, 2024. And ahead of that report, analysts are starting to raise their price targets for CRWD strike.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe AI play began last year with the tech titans Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and the rest of the “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nThe promises of a transformative new technology quickly shifted markets. You know the story by now.\n\nBut outside of the big winners like Nvidia, which has seen shares rise about 400% in the last year, new companies with even gaudier gains have started to emerge.\n\nLike Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nThe company’s stock chart, as you can see, looks like a perfect hockey stick in the context of its 2023-24 rally, even with Friday's 12% sell-off. It’s Mav and Goose in an unrestricted climb. It’s flat, flat, flat, and then it goes big. It’s the story of AI.\n\nAccording to Bank of America’s newly launched coverage (Buy, with a $1,040 price objective), Super Micro’s strength is building servers from scratch, enabling customization others may not be able to, which is perfect for AI applications. An AI moonshot winner 30 years in the making.\n\nIt’s literal black box hardware technology, and investors are comfortable trusting the contents inside — the stock is up 176% in the past month and 841% in the past year. Its minor scandals of the past few years involving cozy relationships with Iran, Russia, and China do not seem to concern the market.\n\nRight now, credible and mostly credible corporate mentions of AI are producing patterns like these as investor excitement and FOMO continue rushing to bankroll today’s forty-niners.\n\nWe’ve seen it thus far in chips (Nvidia), chip production and architecture (ARM, Super Micro), consumer-facing software (Microsoft), B2B software (Palantir), and devices (all the new phones and computers with AI chips).\n\nIn year two of the AI era, the focus is now shifting at least partly away from these titans to smaller companies that still offer exposure to the sector. Sometimes the spotlight comes from corporate guidance, an analyst note, or even when Uncle Nvidia takes a big stake, as it did this week. And when investors figure out the next potential undervalued AI play, the stock booms.\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Think You Missed Out on Nvidia? 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Jumps.",
        "content": "There is no doubt that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a top artificial intelligence (AI) stock you can buy right now, considering its stranglehold over the market for AI semiconductors.Nvidia commands a whopping 92% share of the AI graphics processing unit (GPU) market thanks to the early move it made in this space by supplying chips to OpenAI for training the hugely popular chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the apex player in the AI chip market with smart moves such as doubling down on its pace of innovation and there are reports that it could be entering the lucrative market for custom AI chips. These are some of the reasons analysts are predicting Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of a whopping 102% over the next five years.\n\nGiven that the AI chip market is expected to clock a CAGR of 37.5% through 2029 and generate $147 billion in annual revenue, it is not surprising to see that analysts expect Nvidia to grow at a breathtaking pace. This tremendous growth could help Nvidia justify its expensive sales multiple of 40.\n\nHowever, there is another chipmaker -- Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) -- that's trading at a relatively cheaper 12.3 times sales right now that you might want to take a closer look at, as it could soar big time in the coming year by giving competition to Nvidia.\n\nAMD's aggressively priced AI chips could help it clock stronger growth\n\nAMD launched its MI300 Instinct family of data center AI accelerators in December to take on Nvidia, and the good news is that these chips have been gaining solid traction among customers. AMD expects to generate at least $3.5 billion in revenue from sales of its AI chips in 2024, up from its original forecast of $2 billion.\n\nHowever, Citi analyst Christopher Danely (as reported by Tom's Hardware) believes that AMD is underestimating its AI revenue potential. Danely predicts that AMD could sell $5 billion worth of AI chips in 2024, a number that's expected to jump to $8 billion next year. There are a couple of reasons for this optimism.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, CEO Lisa Su remarked on the company's January earnings conference call with analysts that AMD has \"additional capacity to support upside demand.\" For comparison, customers reportedly need to wait for as long as 52 weeks to get their hands on Nvidia's AI GPUs, so it wouldn't be surprising to see them turn to AMD to fill the supply gap.\n\nSecond, AMD's AI accelerators are reportedly priced very competitively despite offering solid specs when compared to Nvidia's offerings. Though AMD hasn't revealed the official prices of its MI300 processors, Citi estimates that it is selling one unit of its flagship MI300X processor to Microsoft for $10,000. Other customers are reportedly paying $15,000 for this particular chip, which packs 192 gigabytes (GB) of high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nFor comparison, Nvidia's H100 AI GPU, which is equipped with 80 GB of HBM, is reportedly sold for between $30,000 and $40,000. Also, Nvidia's upcoming H200 AI GPU will be equipped with 141 GB of the latest generation of HBM. So, by offering customers a much larger memory size -- which comes in handy while training large language models -- at a price that's reportedly much lower than that of Nvidia's offerings, AMD is looking to make its presence felt in the AI chip space.\n\nA bigger-then-expected boost in revenue could push AMD's stock higher.\n\nHow much upside can investors expect?\n\nThe consensus analyst estimate is that AMD's revenue will increase 14% in 2024 to $25.8 billion. Assuming that forecast is based on AMD's guidance of $3.5 billion in AI chip revenue, the additional $1.5 billion in sales that Citi expects the chipmaker to generate this year from AI could take its top line to $27.3 billion. That would accelerate AMD's 2024 top-line growth to 20%.\n\nWe saw earlier that AMD is trading at 12.3 times sales right now. That multiple coupled with $27.3 billion in revenue, would send its market cap to $336 billion, a jump of 20% from current levels.\n\nThe most optimistic analyst gives AMD a 12-month price target of $270, pointing toward 56% gains from current levels. If the chipmaker manages to generate more AI revenue than what Wall Street is forecasting, which it could do by capturing a good chunk of its foundry partner's production capacity, then don't be surprised to see shares of AMD approach this Street-high price target in the coming year.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "5 Crypto Stocks Riding on the Hot Bitcoin Rally This Year",
        "content": "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has reclaimed its market cap to more than $1 trillion for the first time in two years. The crypto has surged past $52,000, gaining nearly 25% so far this year on the back of a fresh wave of investors’ interest in tokens.\r\n\r\nWith the digital asset rally, cryptocurrency stocks also surged. We have presented five top-performing stocks that have been leading the rally in the cryptocurrency space this year. These are CleanSpark CLSK, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Marathon Digital Holdings MARA and Iris Energy IREN.\n\nInside the Surge in Bitcoin\n\nThe launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January has been acting as the major catalyst for the bitcoin surge as it has made it easier for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning the asset, thereby underscoring growth of cryptocurrency in mainstream investment platforms.\r\n\r\nIn a milestone, data from CryptoQuant revealed that spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) since their inception on Jan 10 this year, reflecting a strong investor interest. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which previously dampened market sentiment, have significantly reduced, further fueling the upward trajectory. Notably, spot Bitcoin ETFs are a game changer for cryptocurrency investors.\r\n\r\nARK Invest, renowned for its optimistic outlook, envisions Bitcoin as a successor to gold as a secure asset, forecasting continued value growth, driven by its increasing integration into the financial ecosystem. It argues that Bitcoin's resilience to economic uncertainties like inflation and interest rate hikes positions it favorably in the current economic environment.\r\n\r\nThe anticipation of bitcoin's upcoming halving event in April is also influencing the cryptocurrency market. Halving, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks, has historically been seen as a catalyst for bitcoin's price. Moreover, the Lunar New Year holidays are contributing to a generally positive sentiment toward bitcoin, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nCleanSpark is engaged in the mining of cryptocurrencies. It owns and operates data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. The stock has gained about 56% this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 81.4% for the fiscal year ending September 2024.\r\n\r\nCLSK currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNvidia is the world leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped about 47% this year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 16, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Is Now 3rd Largest in Market Cap: More Upside Left?\n\nNvidia Corporation outshined Google parent Alphabet Inc. in terms of market capitalization on Feb 14, to become the third-largest company in the United States.\n\nThe boom in artificial intelligence (AI) helped the chipmaker's shares scale northward and close at $739 a share in the last trading session, giving the company a market value of $1.825 trillion, more than Alphabet's $1.822 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia already surpassed Jeff Bezos' Amazon.com, Inc. a day before, in terms of market value.\n\nNvidia has now become a beloved stock among market pundits on the back of elevated demand for AI chips, thereby making the company more valuable than several software companies that develop and apply AI-related technology in their products. Alphabet and Amazon require AI server chips for their cloud-related services.\n\nNonetheless, before the current AI boom, Nvidia was known for providing consumer graphic processors to PC makers, a less money-spinning market. Nvidia was the seventh-largest company two years ago in respect of market value, while it was the twelfth-largest three years back.\n\nNotably, the chip-making behemoth was outside the list of the top 20 largest market capitalization companies four years ago. But at the moment, Nvidia is lagging only behind Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise, particularly in the past year, is due to its dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Interest in AI was propelled by the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which compelled tech bigwigs to restructure their business models. GPU sales skyrocketed on increased demand for AI services and helped Nvidia's business grow by leaps and bounds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, the AI market is projected to witness a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 to 2030 and reach a market volume of $738.8 billion by 2030, per Statista. Thus, Nvidia is further poised to do well in the near term, and its supremacy in the chip market will be challenging for its adversaries.\n\nWhile improvement in GPU sales is primarily responsible for Nvidia's stellar performance, recovery in the PC market is also expected to benefit the chipmaker. PC sales took a beating due to a rise in price pressures. However, the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening measures curbed inflationary pressure in recent times and helped Nvidia's PC shipments improve in its latest reported quarter.\n\nThanks to such an encouraging scenario, investors should place their bets on Nvidia despite the stock being pricey. Nvidia has more upside, with its expected earnings growth rate for the current year coming in at a whopping 268.9%. Its shares have already outperformed the broader S&P 500 in the past year (+235.1% vs +22.0%).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nvidia's current-year earnings has moved up 0.2% over the past 60 days. Additionally, Nvidia's net profit margin is a solid 42.1%, way more than the 20% mark, which indicates a high margin. This means the chipmaker can control its operational expenses and generate enough profit from sales, a tell-tale sign that its shares should further scale upward.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia is a cash-rich company, thereby remaining immune to market vagaries. As of October 2023, Nvidia has an enormous $18.28 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNvidia rightfully carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "5 Crypto-Centric Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Reaches Key Milestone",
        "content": "On Feb 14, the largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) reached a milestone to close the day with more than $1 trillion in market capital, for the first time since December 2021. In intraday trading, the digital currency rose to $52,079, marking its highest level since December 2021.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market started 2024 on a positive note after an impressive rally last year. The much-hyped reformation in the cryptocurrency space took place on Jan 10. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved rule changes to allow the creation of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As many as 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched last month.\n\nAfter soaring 157% in 2023, Bitcoin has railed more than 20% year to date. Bitcoin continues to hold a lot of potential. The SEC’s latest decision is likely to turn out to be a landmark, positioning the entire crypto space as an integral component of mainstream finance. The game-changing decision of the SEC will allow individuals, money managers and other financial institutions to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it.\n\nMoreover, the next Bitcoin halving will occur in the first half of 2024. When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 63.1% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 1.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 60 days.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR’s commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 60 days.\n\nCleanSpark Inc. CLSK operates as a bitcoin miner in the Americas. CLSK owns and operates data centers that primarily run on low-carbon power. CLSK’s infrastructure supports Bitcoin, a digital commodity and a tool for financial independence and inclusion.\n\nCleanSpark has an expected earnings growth rate of 81.4% for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last seven days.\n\nIris Energy Ltd. IREN is a Bitcoin mining company. IREN builds, owns and operates data center infrastructure with a focus on entry into regions where it can access abundant and/or under-utilized renewable energy to power its operations.\n\nIREN has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) came of age last year, and the latest advancements caught the tech world off guard. Earlier forms of the technology have been around for decades, but these next-generation algorithms can do so much more. This includes creating a variety of original content, including images, text, and audio.\n\nBeyond creating new content, generative AI can summarize emails and draft potential responses, create presentations from existing data, search the internet and company databases using specific criteria, and even draft and debug computer code.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates has said, \"The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone.\" That's a bold proclamation, but the chorus of tech aficionados that concur is growing louder.\n\nWhile there are plenty of AI stocks poised to reap the benefits of this transition, the one with arguably the most potential upside is Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNo longer just fun and games\n\nNvidia pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that rendered the lifelike images that revolutionized the video game industry. However, it was the decision to adapt that technology to other applications that was instrumental in the company's success in AI. Parallel processing, the underlying technology that made GPUs so effective, takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them into smaller bits, making them more manageable.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings, Nvidia has adapted its technology to a long and growing list of applications, including high-performance computing, cloud computing, data centers, and AI. Each new use case expanded the company's total addressable market, which management estimated at $1 trillion early last year -- and that was before the rapid adoption of generative AI began in earnest.\n\nThe company's recent results help illustrate the large and growing opportunity. In Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), it delivered record revenue of $18.1 billion, which surged 206%, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.71 soared 1,274%. While easy comps from the prior year skewed the overall results, the implications are clear. Lest there be any doubt, it was the company's data center segment, which includes chips used for AI processing, that did the heavy lifting -- generating record revenue of $14.5 billion, jumping 279% -- and accounting for 80% of the company's revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal fourth quarter next week, and its forecast was eye-opening. The company guided for record revenue of $20 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up 230% year over year. Management's commentary left no doubt that it was AI driving this train.\n\nAs the potential use cases for AI grow, so too do the estimates of the opportunity. Conservative estimates suggest generative AI could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is much more bullish, estimating the total addressable market for AI could be as high as $37 trillion by 2030. While it's difficult to pin down the exact size of the opportunity, it's sure to be substantial -- and Nvidia's processors provide the technology that makes it all possible.\n\nThe undisputed leader in the field\n\nThere are other reasons to believe Nvidia stock will only go higher from here. The company controls an estimated 95% of the data center market, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino. The data center market is expected to rise from $263 billion in 2022 to $603 billion by 2030, according to Prescient and Strategic Intelligence Market Research. As the leader in the space, Nvidia will ride that tailwind higher.\n\nThe company also dominates the field of machine learning -- an established branch of AI. Nvidia has a market share estimated at 95%, according to data compiled by New Street Research.\n\nThis helps illustrate the inexorable ties between data centers and AI -- and Nvidia is the clear choice in both. As companies continue to adopt generative AI, there's every indication that Nvidia processors will continue to be the industry standard.\n\nPrice is what you pay; value is what you get\n\nThere's the hotly contested subject of valuation to be considered. Using the most commonly employed metrics, Nvidia is selling for 96 times earnings and 40 times sales (as of this writing), which is enough to make value investors run for cover -- but other metrics tell a different story.\n\nNvidia has been generating triple-digit growth, which is expected to continue -- at least over the short term. As such, that growth must, of necessity, be factored into its valuation. Enter Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the benchmark for an undervalued stock.\n\nThe digital transformation and adoption of AI show no signs of slowing and will likely accelerate from here. Given its market-leading position and surprisingly modest valuation, Nvidia offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks PANW is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 2.\n\nPalo Alto projects its fiscal second-quarter revenues in the range of $1.955-$1.985 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 18-20%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97 billion, implying growth of 19.1% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.29-$1.31 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW’s non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $1.30 per share, indicating an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.05.\n\nPalo Alto’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 22.2%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nPalo Alto’s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is expected to have boosted its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.\n\nThe growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 15% and 18% ($2.335-$2.385 billion) in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMoreover, the increased use of the cloud and remote networks in a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks. This is leading to a rise in the demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW’s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.\n\nPalo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which encompasses the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal second quarter as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto’s products by government organizations. The company’s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.\n\nThis FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector’s trust in PANW’s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.\n\nHigher software mix, normalization in the supply-chain environment and efficiencies in customer support are anticipated to have aided the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, better cost management is expected to have driven the second-quarter bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palo Alto this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough PANW currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, AutoZone AZO and Booking Holdings BKNG have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.26%.

        "title": "MORNING BID AMERICAS-Global stocks at two-year highs, Nikkei skirts record",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan A confusing mix of red hot stock markets, chilly U.S. economic updates and hawkish Federal Reserve noises make for a foggy end to the week as U.S. producer inflation numbers hove into view.\n\nMajor stock indexes at least seem in little doubt about the direction of travel.\n\nGlobal stocks hit 2-year highs as the Nikkei soared again to within a hair's breadth of the record set at the height of Japan's property bubble in 1990 and Hong Kong's beaten down Hang Seng rallied more than 2% ahead of China's post-New Year reopening next week.\n\nAnd despite the economy's stumble into recession late last year, the Bank of Japan is on track to end negative interest rates in coming months, according to Reuters sources, and only wages growth needs assessing before it acts.\n\nThe yen slipped back lower regardless, while the latest weekly data showed foreign investors can't get enough of Japan - increasing purchases of Japanese stocks by a net 817.43 billion yen ($5.44 billion) in the biggest inflow since Jan. 12.\n\nBack on Wall St, the hot/cold debate on the U.S. economic performance in 2024 on Thursday leaned heavily to the cooler side of things - not least as frigid weather during January depressed retail sales and industrial production.\n\nWhether the cold snap masks the true strength of the U.S. economy is now an open question as jobless claims fell again and regional Fed surveys showed buoyant business sentiment nonetheless.\n\nWith Friday's producer price report now top of the radar, bond markets are wary of a sticky surprise akin to the consumer price report earlier this week.\n\nA combination of surging stocks, which saw the S&P500 climb back within 0.5% of record peaks again, and inflation worries has Treasury yields nudging higher again into today's open.\n\nAnd Fed officials are sounding wary despite the seemingly soft January economic readouts.\n\nAtlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic, who is pencilling in only two rate cuts this year, said the central bank was not ready yet to start easing.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Right now, a strong labor market and macroeconomy offer the chance to execute these policy decisions without oppressive urgency,\" he said, adding the economy may even have \"pent-up exuberance\" that could drive up demand again.\n\nAnd there was no shortage of pent-up exuberance in some of the high octane parts of the tech sector that are increasingly enmeshed.\n\nShares of smaller AI firms rallied again on Thursday after the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia disclosed stakes in them, offering clues on its growth strategy.\n\nThe rally showed Nvidia's growing influence in the AI world as its market value grows at a scorching pace, making it the third most-valuable U.S. company. Its largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm Holdings, the chip designer that Nvidia failed to buy after an $80 billion deal hit the antitrust hurdle two years ago.\n\nElsewhere, the interest rate picture was equally hard to read.\n\nEuropean Central Bank officials sounded more dovish.\n\nECB member and Bank of France head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Friday there are several compelling reasons why the ECB should not hold off for too long on rate cuts.\n\n\"Acting gradually and pragmatically may be preferable to deciding too late and then having to over-adjust,\" he said.\n\nAnd in what's been a slightly dizzying week for British rates markets - moving between news of a UK recession and soothing inflation updates to hawkish Bank of England soundings and Friday's blowout retail sales report - the looming election also came on to the radar.\n\nBritain's Labour Party dealt a crushing blow to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives on Friday, winning contests for two new lawmakers in votes that indicated the opposition party was on track to win a national election later this year.\n\nSterling was steady, while UK stocks and gilt yields were higher.\n\nInto Friday's open then, U.S. stock futures continue to push higher and see the market eyeing new historic peaks at the open. The Vix volatility gauge was subdued below 14.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Friday: * US Jan producer price inflation, housing starts/permits, University of Michigan Feb household sentiment survey. * Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin, San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly and Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all speak. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks * Munich Security Conference including NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky * U.S. corp earnings: Coinbase, Liberty Broadband, PPL, Vulcan Materials, Balchem, Trade Desk\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Hugh Lawson; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is at the center of a new meme stock rally.\n\nIts earnings report next Wednesday will put that theme to the test. Again.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, the most creative voice on Wall Street today, marrying a dramatic flair with a prescient, unabashed bullishness on AI's investment case, called Nvidia's quarterly results from last May a \"jaw dropping\" event.\n\n\"The Street was all awaiting last night's Nvidia quarter and guidance to gauge the magnitude of this AI demand story with many skeptics saying an AI bubble was forming and instead Jensen & Co. delivered guidance for the ages,\" Ives wrote at the time.\n\nAnd Ives was only just getting started.\n\nIn August, Nvidia's increased revenue forecast was a \"drop the mic\" moment for the company, in Ives' view.\n\nBy November, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had been crowned by Ives as the \"Godfather of AI\" after the company once again raised its sales forecast. Ives added the company's November outlook was \"guidance heard around the world as the AI Revolution is accelerating into 2024 for the broader tech sector.\"\n\nThree months later, and what do we have in the market? Anything and everything with an AI play catching a bid while Nvidia has become the third-largest company in the market.\n\nLate Wednesday, for instance, the chip giant disclosed modest stock investments in Arm Holdings (ARM), SoundHound AI (SOUN), and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX).\n\nShares of all three rallied on Thursday following the news, most notably SoundHound, which gained 60% on news Nvidia owned about 1.5% of the company's outstanding shares as of Dec. 31.\n\nAdd to this the action seen in Arm stock last week and the now weekslong rally in cloud storage play Super Micro Computer (SMCI) — which has seen its stock gain ~200% in a month and nearly 1000% over the last 12 months — and we can see that a bona fide AI craze has broken out in the stock market. One in which the mere suggestion that a company could be set to benefit from accelerating AI-related spending is enough to bid shares higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, as Ives noted in his May 2023 report, the notion that an AI-fueled market rally is hanging by a thread only Nvidia can sew on tightly is far from a novel idea. And so perhaps it is our error to see next week's results from Nvidia as holding much significance beyond the fortunes of Nvidia itself.\n\nMoreover, the corporate earnings outlook that can backstop a rally growing beyond AI continues to improve. Meanwhile, the number of times corporate executives have brought up AI on earnings calls of late has actually been on the decline.\n\nAnd unlike the meme stock rally of 2021 in which fundamental stories were haphazardly retrofitted to explain why a stock might double or triple in a few trading days, the enthusiasm for AI plays is based on a firmer foundation of actual corporate spending.\n\nBut with the locus of that investment found on Nvidia's income statement, it's hard to shake the feeling that these results will mean something bigger for the stock market rally. Even if we've seen this film before.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "TSLA Stock Warning: Why Tesla Is at the Start of a Long-Term Decline",
        "content": "Down 25% so far this year, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock outlook isn’t fantastic. The company looks to be at the beginning of a long-term decline as the company loses market share amidst growing competition in the electric vehicle space.\n\nTesla was the sole mass producer of fully electric vehicles for over a decade. Tesla sold poorly designed EVs at premium prices due to this advantage. If consumers wanted an EV, they had to buy a Tesla; not anymore. As companies ranging from General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) scale their own EVs at more affordable prices, Tesla is getting left in the dust.\n\nNo Longer ‘Magnificent’\n\nDespite problems at the company, Tesla’s stock and CEO Elon Musk remained unaffected. Despite poor quality ratings, deadly crashes, vehicle recalls, regulatory scrutiny, and social media controversies, TSLA stock continued to rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBetween 2011 and 2021, TSLA stock increased an astounding 20,250%, rising from just $2 a share on a split adjusted basis to more than $400. Tesla became a leading growth stock that was cheered on by retail investors.\n\nTesla’s stock performance was so strong that analysts lumped the company in with a group of other mega-cap technology stocks that came to be known as the “Magnificent 7.”\n\nYet in reality, TSLA stock has trailed the performance of the other Mag 7 that includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since hitting an all-time high in November 2021, Tesla’s share price has fallen 54%. In a sign of shifting sentiment. Practically nobody is calling Tesla a top growth stock today.\n\nTSLA Stock Outlook: Losing Ground\n\nToyota best illustrates the competitive threat that Tesla is facing. The best-selling Japanese automaker plans to be selling 3.5 million fully electric vehicles annually by 2030. Eventually, Toyota plans to convert all of its vehicles to fully electric versions.\n\nStory continues\n\nToyota currently sells about 10 million cars, trucks and SUVs a year. Tesla sold 1.85 million vehicles in 2023. In a nice bit of irony, Toyota’s stock is up 25% year-to-date, while Tesla’s share price is down 25% since the start of the year.\n\nWhile Toyota provides an instructive example, it is one of more than a dozen automakers who are shifting to fully electric vehicles, most of which offer superior quality and lower prices than Tesla.\n\nTesla’s share of its home market in America fell from 62% to 50% in 2023, a record low. That’s a big loss of market share in a short amount of time, which bodes poorly for the TSLA stock outlook. It looks unlikely to reverse itself as competition intensifies in the coming months and years.\n\nCompounding Problems\n\nOther problems that are pulling TSLA stock lower include an economic slump in China that has hurt sales. There also have been aggressive price cuts and discounts around the world that have hurt Tesla’s margins. Plus, Tesla has failed to introduce any new electric vehicles that are better made and more affordable to buy.\n\nThe Cybertruck that went on sale late last year looks interesting, but also seems impractical and has a starting price of more than $60,000. There are rumors that Tesla is developing a new mass market electric vehicle codenamed “Redwood.”\n\nBut that new EV is unlikely to be available before mid-2025, at the earliest. Meanwhile, Tesla delivered a dreadful earnings print for the fourth-quarter of last year, and offered grim guidance, with management saying electric vehicle volume growth in 2024 is likely to be “notably lower.”\n\nSell TSLA Stock\n\nIt all seems to have caught up to Tesla and the once seemingly invincible automaker now appears to be vulnerable. The company is no longer able to get by on a lack of competition. Demand has weakened, market share is in freefall, and margins are being eroded.\n\nThe company’s management team seems to lack creativity and new products have failed to inspire. With the share price sinking, investors would be smart to take any profits they have and get out now. TSLA stock is out of juice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "title": "5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "While the hype hit new heights over the past year, artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a while and the enthusiasm is here to stay. Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) estimates that the generative AI market could grow 40%-plus annually and reach $1.2 trillion by 2032. That level of growth will also create an estimated $280 billion in new revenue opportunities from software alone.\n\nEmerging new industries are exciting, but picking the long-term winners can be challenging. For all investors know, the most prolific company of the next 20 years might not even exist yet. That suggests casting a wide net could be the best investment strategy. In this case, the best approach might be to find the early winners, own their stocks, and follow how AI progresses over time.\n\nAfter pouring through dozens of companies, these five stood out for their strong positions to lead the industry's growth. Consider buying and holding these AI stocks. They enjoy pole positions in the AI industry and could generate life-changing investment returns over the next decade and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia: This company owns an estimated 90% of the AI chip market\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) might seem like it became Wall Street's hottest trend overnight. Seemingly just as quickly, graphics chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has taken a stranglehold on the market for chips used to power AI models (it controls as much as 90% of the market). One of its competitors, Advanced Micro Devices, estimates the AI chip market will grow to $400 billion over the next several years. Do the math, and Nvidia's companywide revenue of $45 billion over the past year looks poised to skyrocket.\n\nThe competition will chase Nvidia, but the company's high-performance chips, combined with its popular CUDA computing software optimized to get the most out of them, create a turnkey package the industry keeps opting for. Perhaps Nvidia's competitors weren't ready for the AI surge. Shares have gained over 230% this past year alone, but the long-term demand for AI chips seems poised to drive the stock even higher as Nvidia grows.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. ASML: Manufacturing cutting-edge chips relies on this one manufacturer\n\nIronically, most chip companies, including Nvidia, don't build their chips. They only design them. Chip factories, called fabs, do the building and require cutting-edge machines to make intricate patterns on silicon wafers. ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) designs and builds extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are used to create the most advanced chips hitting the market today.\n\nRemarkably, ASML is the only company that makes this type of machine. This machine is so complex that it takes 13 shipping containers and 250 crates to ship and costs up to $400 million each. Naturally, AI and general technology will continue progressing. Breakthroughs will require increasingly better machines to make better chips. ASML should be a long-term beneficiary of the AI boom.\n\n3. Palantir: Enterprises are flocking to use this company's custom software applications\n\nBig technology companies are spending to build advanced computer systems, but smaller enterprises want to use AI technology to help run their businesses. Because of this, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) is seeing growth take off. The company sells custom software applications built on three proprietary platforms: Gotham, Foundry, and AIP. Specifically, AIP was designed for building and deploying AI in commercial applications.\n\nPalantir gets over half its revenue from government customers, the U.S. government being its largest and oldest customer. However, the commercial segment is thriving. Palantir's enterprise customer base grew 55% year over year in the fourth quarter and 22% over the previous three months to 221. That's just a couple of hundred companies in a broader corporate landscape of millions. If companies worldwide need AI to compete, Palantir could grow for years.\n\n4. Supermicro: Turnkey server systems are in high demand, and this company is heating up\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), better known as Supermicro, has evolved from selling components to complete IT solutions over the decades. However, the explosion of data center demand for AI is beginning to reach Supermicro, and the business is taking off. The company's revenue growth has accelerated, and management believes its total revenue will double this fiscal year (ending over the summer).\n\nAgain, its success makes sense. Companies need AI capabilities, but non-technical businesses are far better off hiring a third party like Supermicro to come in and build a system for them. The modular design makes it easier to expand the system if their computing needs grow over time. Management estimates they're growing five times faster than the broader industry, meaning customers choose them over others. It's promising for Supermicro's long-term trajectory and shareholders alike.\n\n5. Microsoft: Its partnership with ChatGPT's creator is a potential goldmine\n\nThe AI hype may have begun with ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot built by OpenAI. Tech giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) jumped on the opportunity and furthered its partnership with OpenAI, tying OpenAI's growth to its cloud platform, Azure. That has already bore fruit. Microsoft reported an uptick in Azure's growth in its latest quarter, noting that over half the Fortune 500 already uses Azure and OpenAI in their businesses. Azure is the world's second-leading cloud platform, only trailing Amazon's AWS.\n\nBut with Microsoft, you get a diversified business with revenue streams from cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and more. Its massive size and deep pockets also give it a higher floor than most stocks you'll come across. Of course, a $3.1 trillion market cap means it's probably too large to make you a millionaire alone. Instead, expect a steady portfolio performer that generally grinds higher over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Ultra-Popular Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Billionaires Are Selling and the 1 AI Stock They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "For investors, the quarterly release of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is like Christmas all over again.\n\nA 13F provides investors with a detailed snapshot of what stocks Wall Street's top money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the fourth quarter). In other words, it offers an inside look at what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of the brightest asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere's perhaps no bigger intrigue at the moment than knowing what Wall Street's top money managers are doing with artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. AI, which involves using software and systems to handle tasks that would typically be overseen by humans, could add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030, according to a report released last year by PwC.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13F filings, billionaire investors were eager to pare down their stakes in two ultra-popular AI stocks and simply couldn't stop buying shares of another brand-name AI-inspired company.\n\nWidely owned AI stock No. 1 that billionaires are decisively selling: Nvidia\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that prominent billionaire investors have been kicking to the curb is none other than the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). During the December-ended quarter, eight billionaires reduced their fund's respective stakes in this semiconductor giant, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares). Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares). Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares). David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares). Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares). Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares). John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares).\n\nIf you're wondering why these top investors would lighten their load on Wall Street's hottest megacap stock, increasing competition and margin cannibalization may be the answer.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the moment, Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup have estimated that Nvidia's chips could account for a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. But competition is picking up. Advanced Micro Devices will be increasing the rollout of its MI300X GPU this year, while Intel is debuting its Gaudi3 generative AI software chip as a direct competitor to the H100 later this year.\n\nInternal competition is a potential problem, too. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms are Nvidia's respective No. 1 and No. 2 in total spending. But even though these companies are spending big bucks with Nvidia, they're hard at work developing their own AI chips. Sooner than later, Microsoft and Meta's reliance on Nvidia should lessen.\n\nNvidia's expansion could also, ironically, be its undoing -- at least when it comes to the company's gross margin. The bulk of Nvidia's data-center growth in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January) was the result of A100 and H100 GPU scarcity. When a product is scarce and in high demand, the seller typically commands exceptional pricing power. As Nvidia ramps up production of its high-powered GPUs, it could cannibalize its own stellar pricing power.\n\nWidely owned AI stock No. 2 that billionaires are decisively selling: Microsoft\n\nThe other AI stock that billionaires have thrown out with the bath water is the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap, Microsoft. Despite investing aggressively in OpenAI (the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT) and developing its own AI chips, seven genius billionaire investors were sellers during Q4, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares). Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,569,462 shares). Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares). Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (796,892 shares). Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (787,113 shares). Terry Smith of Fundsmith (705,498 shares). Dan Loeb of Third Point (210,000 shares)\n\nViking Global and Renaissance Technologies completely exited their fund's stakes in the world's largest public company. The reasoning behind these sales may boil down to a combination of history and valuation.\n\nOver the past 30 years, there has been no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends. While some of these trends have made long-term investors notably richer (e.g., the advent of the internet and cloud computing), every next-big-thing investment has navigated its way through an initial bubble. This is to say that investors regularly overestimate the early uptake of new innovations or technologies, and AI is unlikely to be an exception.\n\nMicrosoft's valuation is another potential sticking point. Investors right now would be paying a multiple of 31 times forward-year earnings, which is a far cry from the year-end multiple of 16 to 25 times forward-year earnings investors were paying between 2014 and 2018.\n\nThe one thing that could ultimately make these billionaires regret their decision to sell is Microsoft's incredible cash flow. The perfect blend of high-margin cash flow from its legacy segments (e.g., Windows and Office), coupled with high-growth initiatives like cloud service infrastructure-platform Azure, afford Microsoft the luxury to take chances on the acquisition and innovation front. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe artificial intelligence stock billionaires can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nHowever, not all artificial intelligence stocks were off-limits by billionaire money managers during the December-ended quarter. E-commerce company Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which is utilizing generative AI in a variety of ways to enhance voice interactions with Alexa, as well as help merchants create more compelling and tailored advertisements, was a popular buy for eight billionaires, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares). Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares). Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares). Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares). John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares). Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares). Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares).\n\nAlthough AI contributes to the lure of Amazon's various products and services, billionaires are most likely piling in because of the company's three rapidly growing ancillary segments.\n\nMost consumers are probably familiar with Amazon because it has the most-dominant online marketplace in the United States. While this segment is responsible for a lot of revenue, online retail sales produce low margins. The lion's share of Amazon's cash flow can be traced back to its cloud-infrastructure service segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), as well as subscription services and advertising services.\n\nAWS is Amazon's superstar. It's the leading provider of cloud-infrastructure services globally and is approaching $97 billion in annual run rate sales. Not only is enterprise spending on cloud-infrastructure services still in its early innings, but the margins associated with cloud services put e-commerce margins to shame. It's not uncommon for AWS to account for more than half of Amazon's operating income.\n\nThe other catalyst that encouraged billionaires to mash the buy button for Amazon stock during Q4 might be its valuation. While the traditional price-to-earnings ratio is liable to have value investors running in the opposite direction, Amazon is historically cheap relative to its cash flow.\n\nCash flow tends to be a smarter way of valuing Amazon given its penchant for reinvesting most of its operating cash flow back into its logistics operations and various high-growth initiatives. After spending the entirety of the 2010s valued between 23- and 37-times year-end cash flow, investors can buy shares today for about 12 times consensus cash-flow estimates in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 most valuable blockchain companies in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the global blockchain industry, its current status, and the latest news, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024.\n\nWith the first quarter of the 21st century about to be over, the Internet of today is vastly different from the one that had taken shape at the tail end of the dotcom era of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Now, the Internet proliferates every aspect of life, whether it's transportation, work, entertainment, leisure, or even buying groceries. Additionally, two and a half decades after the start of the new century, a handful of players since the dotcom era have survived and now reign supreme in the stock market.\n\nThese bigwigs include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, 2024 is turning out to be a year that appears to be challenging the dominance of big technology as the market value of the semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has started to rival that of the world's biggest electronic commerce company Amazon and Alphabet, whose search engine reigns supreme in nearly every country in the world.\n\nThe significant transformation that the Internet has undergone over the course of the past decades also means that now, there are new technologies and industries that were un-thought of when Jeff Bezos first started delivering books. One such technology is blockchain, a secure ledger that gained popularity along with Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics.\n\nA blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.\n\nStory continues\n\nNaturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit. For instance, as part of our coverage of 11 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts, we discovered several blockchain stocks that had impressive share price upside. The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.\n\nDelving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.\n\nThe next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThis is unsurprising since all these companies are leaders in the cloud computing space, and each of them offers blockchain based services as well. So while Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of Web3, a 'new' internet that seeks to run on the blockchain, Alphabet's Google Cloud has been storing Bitcoin mining data for years and the firm itself has invested billions of dollars in the blockchain industry. Similarly, IBM is one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry since it offers companies the ability to build blockchain systems across a myriad of industries such as supply chain management and food product sourcing.\n\nAs a whole, now that Bitcoin has touched the coveted $1 trillion mark, the next Bitcoin halving is due soon to allow even more miners to profit in the industry, retail players are able to access Bitcoin through exchange traded funds, new areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) capture the public attention, and GPU supply chain stabilizes in the wake of increased A.I. demand, the blockchain industry might be in for some favorable tailwinds in the coming months.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest blockchain companies in the world. Some notable names are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet on a modern touchscreen device displaying a graph of the company's assets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest blockchain companies in the world, we first made a list of the firms that either mine Bitcoin, offer data center space to Bitcoin or associated companies, or offer blockchain related services. Then, the firms were analyzed to see whether blockchain or blockchain related products and services represent their key business operations or if the industry would find it difficult to function if their products went off the market. This meant that while Microsoft and Amazon do offer these products, they were excluded since their core business operations focus on other industries; but, it also meant that a GPU firm made the cut. Finally, the remaining companies were ranked by their market capitalization and the biggest blockchain companies were as follows.\n\nTop 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\n2o.

        "title": "Top AI Memory Maker SK Hynix May Add to 95% Rally",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors are bullish on the chance for more gains in shares of Nvidia Corp.’s top memory supplier SK Hynix Inc., which remain cheap even after a huge runup.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJapan Loses Its Spot as World's Third-Largest Economy as It Slips Into Recession Putin Steps Into US Race to Back ‘Old-Style’ Biden Over Trump Hawaii Rightly Rejects Supreme Court’s Gun Nonsense Dozens of Banks Rapidly Piled Up Commercial Property Loans Wall Street Looks Past Inflation Angst Before PPI: Markets Wrap\n\nThe South Korean company’s stock has surged 95% since the start of last year, far outpacing memory rivals Samsung Electronics Co. and Micron Technology Inc. Yet it’s still trading at just 11 times forward earnings estimates, compared with 15 for Samsung, 30 for Micron and 27 times for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\nThe key is that SK Hynix was able to get a jump on the competition in the market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which can supply the large volumes of data at the high speed required by AI. That’s helped it garner greater investor attention after years of playing No. 2 to Samsung.\n\n“It’s too risky not to own SK Hynix in the portfolio,” said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. “As global big tech firms are seeing further gains, investors are expecting more upside in SK Hynix too.”\n\nHBM features a stack of DRAM optimized to work alongside accelerators, processors used extensively in the training of AI. Not subject to the cyclical demand and pricing of commoditized traditional memory, HBM chips are much more lucrative.\n\nHigh-priced AI products helped SK Hynix report an operating profit for the three months ended December, after four-straight quarterly losses.\n\nHBM Leader\n\nThe company is looking to maintain its lead over Samsung and Micron in AI. To that end, SK Hynix has reportedly tied up with top foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to develop its next generation HBM chip. SK Hynix declined to comment on the report, while TSMC didn’t respond to requests from Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat news is “triggering market speculation about SK Hynix being a clear winner in the HBM space,” and reflects strong demand for its products, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Jay Kwon wrote in a research note this week. “We expect strong share momentum to continue near term.”\n\nKwon is one of 40 analysts that have a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, with just three hold recommendations and no sells. The average sell-side price target indicates an expected return of 20% over the next 12 months.\n\nOptions traders are bullish too, with this year’s average daily call volume up more than 57% from last year, according to Bloomberg calculations. The most popular contract traded on Thursday was a bet that the stock will rise another 4% by mid-March.\n\nUpcoming catalysts include Nvidia’s earnings report on Feb. 21, which should provide more details on the outlook for AI. Investors will also keep an eye out for news of further partnerships or progress by rivals for any early signs of leadership change in this burgeoning field.\n\n“Wielding a big competitive advantage in HBM, SK Hynix could capture a large market share in the DRAM industry,” Masahiro Wakasugi, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note. “Its HBM DRAM dominance is poised to persist in the near term, given its deep-rooted relationships with AI processor designers.”\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc., racing to add more artificial intelligence capabilities, is nearing the completion of a critical new software tool for app developers that would step up competition with Microsoft Corp. Microsoft Corp. will make four exclusive Xbox games available for Nintendo Co.’s Switch and Sony Group Corp.’s PlayStation, sharing homegrown titles with rivals in the first significant way as the company looks to boost revenue in a stagnant gaming market. Applied Materials Inc., the largest US maker of chipmaking machinery, jumped in late trading after giving a bullish revenue forecast for the current period, signaling that some of the largest semiconductor companies are increasing their investments in new production.\n\n--With assistance from Jane Lanhee Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

        "content": "Technology companies are one of the stock market segments with the most significant growth and investor attention. The benchmark ETF for the tech sector is the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK). It has $62 billion in assets under management, and the top three companies within the ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Over the past year, it has seen more than a 40% return increase. These tech stocks have spelled big gains for the ETF.\n\nThe tech industry is filled with stocks that offer investors the possibility of an unforgettable February and beyond. Below are a few growing technology companies with a bright future ahead. You should heavily consider these for inclusion in an investment portfolio with the goal of unforgettable returns.\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides an automation platform that uses generative (AI) analytics and forecasting for businesses and government organizations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOver this past year, its stock price has grown by 62%. This is due to improved financial results reported from its recent earnings report for the third quarter of 2024. The report stated that total revenue increased by 24%. Its net loss was nearly cut in half to $32 million compared to the previous year. The financial outlook for the fourth quarter predicts that total revenue will be around $381 million to $386 million. This is much better when compared to Q3 2023, which was $326 million.\n\nUiPath provides robotic automation services heavily reliant on generative (AI) technology. The continued optimization and advancement of the company offer a great chance for investors. Investors can take advantage of this cutting-edge company that is projected to keep experiencing growth and investor excitement.\n\nCelestica (CLS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelestica (NYSE:CLS) is a supply chain optimization company that provides mechanical assembly and cloud connectivity products.\n\nStory continues\n\nCLS is a company that has seen tremendous growth over this past year. This is due primarily to several events, including the rollout of its new generation 800G switch. This switch improves data center and artifact intelligence connectivity capabilities and its recently improved financial position.\n\nOn Jan. 29, CLS reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The report stated that total revenue grew slightly by 5%. It also stated that its net income and free cash flow doubled when compared to Q4 of 2022. Celestica announced its Q1 2024 outlook. The company predicted total revenue will not drastically change from Q3.\n\nCelestica beat analyst expectations for its recent earnings report. With continued improvement in products used within the data center and generative (AI) space, investors should continue to be excited about this company. Even with its share price surging by more than 37% within the last month, it still shows no sign of stopping, which may provide investors with an unforgettable February.\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a manufacturer and seller of photomask products. Photomask products are a semiconductor manufacturing component. These components allow circuit patterns to transfer to wafers. It also produces various electrical components.\n\nPhotronics has seen its share price increase by 80% over this past year, primarily from a positive earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023, which was released on Dec. 13 and stated that its total revenue rose by 8% and earnings per share increased by 20% compared to the years prior. Following this most recent earnings release, its stock price surged 34%.\n\nIn late January, there was a leadership transition in which the chief financial officer, John Jordan, will retire in February and be replaced by Eric Rivera as interim CFO. The stock price hasn’t seen much movement since this was announced, which may signal that this news is unimportant to investors at this time.\n\nPhotronics is a company that is developing more sophisticated integrated circuit products. Investors are excited about the direction the company is going in at this time, and in the future, it is set for significant upside potential.

        "title": "The Next Nvidia? 3 Semiconductor Stocks That Investors Shouldn’t Ignore",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) surprised many investors in 2023 with exceptional gains and financial reports to back them up. The company became a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry and still has plenty of runway left.\n\nNVDA’s success brought more attention to other semiconductor stocks and firms that specialize in AI. Any hint of a tailwind in this industry can send a stock soaring.\n\nSo, many corporations are getting into AI, but some are clearly better than others. These three semiconductor stocks look like promising long-term buying opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a top dividend growth stock that is on its way to a $1 trillion market cap. The firm regularly grows its dividend by 10% or higher each year and offers a 1.65% dividend yield. Shares trade at a 39 P/E ratio after a significant 116% run-up over the past year. The stock has rallied by 355% over the past five years.\n\nHealthy profit margins are a staple for this equity and the firm delivered a 37.2% net profit margin in its most recent quarter. Revenue increased by 5% year over year (YOY) while net income jumped by 7.4% YOY.\n\nAVGO initiated many share buybacks to help elevate the stock price. The firm purchased 2.9 million shares during the third quarter for a grand total of $2.17 billion.\n\nAlso, Broadcom is one of the top dividend growth stocks due to its appreciation, high dividend growth rate, and respectable yield even after all of the gains. Recently, the equity surpassed a $600 billion market cap and is moving fast toward the $1 trillion milestone.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another semiconductor stock that has received plenty of attention. Shares are up by 107% over the past year and have soared by 628% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the semiconductor giant dominated on multiple fronts as it expanded its market share in server, desktop, and mobile. Also, the firm’s line-up of AI products is appealing. The company’s AI chips can lead to meaningful long-term gains.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is coming out of a bearish cycle and reported 10% YOY revenue growth in Q4 2023. That’s a big improvement from the 4% YOY revenue decline from all of 2023 compared to all of 2022.\n\nAlso, it wasn’t too long ago when the company was regularly reporting YOY revenue growth above 20%. The corporation seems to be heading back in that direction which can reward long-term investors. The stock trades at an enticing 0.70 PEG ratio. Therefore, demand for the company’s AI chips can strengthen the valuation.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike many of its peers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) largely missed out on the AI rally. Shares are only up by 39% over the past year due to a strong surge that started in November.\n\nSince the firm’s equity missed out on the rally, it trades at only a 26 P/E ratio while offering a 1.50% dividend yield. Also, TSM has endured economic headwinds similar to AMD and reported flat revenue growth in Q4 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the corporation’s guidance indicates a return to growth. Revenue is expected to range from $18.0 billion to $18.8 billion in the first quarter. And, the midpoint represents a 10% YOY growth rate from the $16.72 billion in Q1 2023 revenue. Leadership anticipates gross margins will be between 52% and 54%.\n\nAlthough Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing hasn’t been a top performer over the past year, a wider lens demonstrates the firm’s full potential. During the past five years, TSM has logged a 250% gain for investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AVGO.

        "title": "13F Season: 3 Whales to Follow",
        "content": "What is a 13F Filing?\n\nA 13F is a quarterly filing required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which mandates institutional investment managers with assets exceeding $100 million to disclose their equity holdings. The filing provides a detailed snapshot of a fund’s portfolio, including the stocks it owns and their respective quantities.\n\n13F filings are due 45 days after the end of the quarter. Investors and analysts use 13F Filings to gain insights into the investment strategies of large institutional investors, such as hedge funds and mutual funds. Tracking 13F filings Is crucial for market participants seeking to understand trends, identify potential investment opportunities, and monitor the transactions of Wall Street’s most influential investors.\n\nTop 3 13Fs to Watch\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia (NVDA) filed its first 13F this week.The leading chipmaker, which became the third largest U.S. company, is worth monitoring because it has a ton of cash (which will likely allow it to increase its stake in investments) and has its finger on the pulse of all things AI. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Nvidia\n\nUnsurprisingly, hot IPO ARM Holdings (ARM) is Nvidia’s top holding. Nvidia, previously tried to purchase ARM in the past, owns nearly $150 million worth. Though the stock is flying high, it’s worth watching its IPO lockup date, which expires on March 12th. After the lockup period expires, insiders who hold massive profits in the stock can sell.\n\nNVDA is looking to diversify beyond “selling the picks to the AI gold rush” and profit from AI-centric investments. Though the public is infatuated with Chatbots, NVDA sees an opportunity in Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX). RXRX, which is NVDA’s second-largest investment, leverages AI to make new drug discoveries.\n\nFinally, SoundHound AI (SOUN), a voice assistant AI platform, and Nano-X Imaging (NNOX), an Israeli-based X-ray company, each jumped more than 50% on NVDA’s 13F disclosure. Though each investment is small relative to NVDA’s cash hoard, investors are encouraged by the leading chipmaker’s blessing.\n\nStory continues\n\nWarren Buffett\n\nWarren Buffett is arguably the best 13F to track. Because the “The Oracle of Omaha” has high conviction investments, a long holding period, and a dependable history, Buffett’s 13F provides value unlike any other filing. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: HedgeVision\n\nThis report, Buffett’s 10 million share trim of Apple (AAPL) will likely get all the headlines. However, the trade only resulted in a 1% decrease in Buffett’s AAPL holdings, and Berkshire Hathaway still holds a gargantuan 50% position in the stock.\n\nThe most notable additions to the portfolio were in energy plays like Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Though energy stocks have been out of favor, Buffett has maintained his unrivaled conviction and has continued to accumulate shares. The buys make sense, considering names like OXY are dirt cheap and have Price-to-Book Values at multi-year lows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDavid Tepper\n\nWhen deciding on who to follow, a foolproof method is to follow those investors who have been correct. Over the past several quarters, Appaloosa’s David Tepper correctly loaded up on tech stocks. Based on the recent 13F filing, Tepper remains bullish. He started a fresh position in Amazon (AMZN) while more than doubling his position in high-growth database software firm Elastic (ESTC).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The stock market rally that began in earnest last spring is starting to get frothy. Some stocks are now making parabolic moves and rising at what appear to be unsustainable rates. Speculation in the market appears to have returned, with cryptocurrencies also rising sharply in recent weeks and now at their highest levels in two years. Stansberry Researchcommented that “animal spirits” appear to have gripped the stock market, noting that many securities are now rising or falling by 5% or more in a single trading session. Is this the start of an overheated market and bubble or the result of random speculation among investors? Time will tell. In the meantime, investors would be rid themselves of these three over-hyped stocks to sell before it’s too late.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of British microchip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is bouncing around like a yo-yo. Yes, ARM stock doubled in four trading sessions after it reported blowout financial results on February 7. But the company’s share price fell 20% on February 13 after the January inflation reading came in hotter than expected, sending the broader market down nearly 2%. The big swings in Arm Holdings’ share price are reminiscent of meme stocks and are being driven entirely by the hype surrounding AI.\n\nARM stock has nearly tripled since the company’s initial public offering (IPO) last September and now has a market capitalization of $153 billion. The company’s share price went into overdrive after management highlighted soaring AI demand for the microchips it designs during their Q4 earnings call. While the furious rally of the past week is no doubt thrilling current shareholders, there are red lights flashing with this stock. Arm’s daily trading volume now exceeds 100 million shares, more than 10 times the average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, the 180-day post-IPO lockup period for ARM stock expires in March, allowing insiders to sell their shares and take profits. This could result in a big downturn in the share price, making Arm an over-hyped stock to sell before it’s too late.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) An image of an animated hand holding a chip\n\nSource: InvestorPlace Media\n\nEven more over-hyped than Arm Holdings is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). Six weeks into 2024, and SMCI stock is now up 200% on the year. In the last 12 months, the company’s share price has increased 825%. Like Arm, the meteoric rise in Super Micro Computer’s stock is being driven entirely by the hype that’s enveloping AI. If investors need a sign that investor excitement over AI has reached a fevered pitch, they need only look at the movement in SMCI stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s stock has also gotten supercharged due to its relationship with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and the fact that Nvidia is using Super Micro’s high-efficiency servers. Demand for the servers is so great, that Super Micro Computer pre-announced its earnings in January. The company’s actual print for the final quarter of last year came in much better-than-expected, sending the stock soaring. But at this point, SMCI stock looks in serious danger of a correction.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the day of this writing, the share price of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 12%. The business intelligence company led by Michael Saylor is seeing its stock rise in tandem with another overhyped asset, Bitcoin (BTC-USD). While Arm and Super Micro are riding the AI hype train, MicroStrategy has hitched its wagon to cryptocurrencies, BTC in particular. MicroStrategy recently bought $37 million more of Bitcoin, bringing the company’s holdings to 190,000 BTC worth $9.69 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy is now one of the world’s largest holders of Bitcoin, and the company has become as well known for its crypto holdings as its software and cloud-computing technologies. With Bitcoin’s price at $51,500, its highest level in two years, MSTR stock is going along for the ride. As Bitcoin’s market capitalization regains $1 trillion, MSTR stock has risen 185% over the last 12 months. The company’s share price is up 445% over the last five years. The question is: what happens when Bitcoin’s price falls?\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is certainly one of the most highly-valued stocks on the market. Recently taking over the fourth position in terms of market capitalization of all stocks globally, NVDA stock has been a big winner for long-term investors, particularly in recent years.\n\nSome price targets for NVDA stock now peg the chip maker surging as high as $1,100 per share. I’m not so sure Nvidia can hit these heights. However, analysts have underestimated its prowess, despite consistent earnings beats in 2023. So, who knows.\n\nWith the largest AI supply chain, Nvidia faces high demand, leading to a soaring stock price. Plus, with the launch of its H200 chips in 2024, its growth trajectory seems promising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere’s why investors may not want to discount this company often viewed as a pure-play on AI just yet.\n\nHigher Expectations\n\nIn November, Nvidia’s stock surged after unveiling new AI and data center chip tech. Sales spiked up to $18.2 billion and profits were reported at $4.02 each. However, despite strong earnings, shares slumped post-report.\n\nIndeed, 2023 was a memorable year for Nvidia as its revenue more than tripled, and data center demand fueled record-high sales of $14.51 billion.\n\nNvidia’s stock surged from $200 to more than $700 over the past year. Speculation continues to mount on whether this stock has what it takes to reach $1,000 per share before the end of the year. Some analysts certainly seem to think this could be the case.\n\nHans Mosesmann, from Rosenblatt Securities, reaffirmed a bullish target of $1,100 for Nvidia within a year. His colleagues predict an average of $687.09. Notably, Goldman Sachs raised its target to $800, citing Nvidia’s AI business strength, and analysts unanimously rate Nvidia as a ‘strong buy.’\n\nLeader in the AI Space\n\nNvidia’s triumph in the world of artificial intelligence stems from its GPU architecture’s remarkable support for parallel processing. With numerous cores adept at handling parallel tasks simultaneously, Nvidia’s GPUs excel in AI’s demanding computational needs. This capability accelerates deep learning model training, data processing, and neural network computations, enhancing AI performance and cementing NVIDIA’s leadership.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s stock displays exceptional strength, boasting high scores in various metrics. It’s a key player in the group called the “Magnificent Seven,” a group of seven high-growth tech stocks that drive the 2023 and 2024 rallies. Ranking first in the fabless semiconductor group, it frequently appears on prestigious lists.\n\nThe company’s dominance in AI stems from prioritizing deep learning and neural network acceleration. Specialized hardware features like Tensor Cores turbocharge crucial operations, such as matrix multiplication, are essential for AI. This optimization has solidified NVIDIA’s leadership in AI solutions.\n\nPartnerships with Strong Companies\n\nCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Nvidia recently announced a collaboration on Feb. 6 to offer streamlined AI infrastructure solutions for data centers, facilitating easy deployment and management. Cisco Chair and CEO Chuck Robbins also emphasized the need for businesses to learn and adapt AI infrastructures, while Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, discussed the significance of AI in business innovation.\n\nBoth companies, leveraging their networking and GPU technology strengths, collaboratively aim to assist customers in AI transitions with secure Ethernet-based infrastructure. Their partnership extends to various product solutions, enabling hybrid work environments and enhancing data center capabilities for AI cluster management and troubleshooting.\n\nVladimir Ester, ClusterPower’s CTO, emphasized the importance of streamlined data center infrastructure for AI environments. Cisco and Nvidia’s collaboration addresses this need, offering secure and adaptable solutions for enterprises, as noted by Neil Anderson of World Wide Technology (WWT). Vijay Bhagavath, IDC Research’s VP of Cloud & Data Center Networks, highlighted the partnership’s ability to meet the unique demands of AI workloads.\n\nBuy NVDA in a Heartbeat\n\nNvidia’s pivotal role in the AI realm is attributed to its hefty investment in research and development. Their relentless pursuit of innovation led to groundbreaking GPU architectures tailored for AI, ensuring a competitive edge and adaptability in a dynamic landscape.\n\nAdditionally, NVDA stock has shown remarkable performance, surpassing 98% of assets and all semiconductor stocks in the past year. Predictions vary regarding the company’s valuation potential, highlighting the importance of thorough research and risk assessment before investing. That said, this is a company with mostly bullish catalysts, analysts and investors supporting its rise. Momentum is its friend, and it’s hard to see the bear case for this stock, at least right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has disclosed investments made in several emerging AI companies, sparking rallies across these stocks. Among the names benefiting include Soundhound (SOUN), Arm (ARM), and Nanox (NNOX).\n\nYahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nJOSH LIPTON: All right. Let's get some tickers now. NVIDIA disclosing investments in smaller AI firms, SoundHound AI, Arm Holdings, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals to name just a few. Shares of these firms getting a boost in today's trade. So this was interesting, Julie.\n\nSo NVIDIA, obviously, which is kind of the face of this boom of interest in AI we're talking about. We know it has stakes now in a few companies. We know, by the way, because NVIDIA included this info in its 13F. So Arm, it looks like that stake was the biggest, about 147 million.\n\nRecall NVIDIA actually tried to acquire Arm but of course, that didn't happen due to regulatory challenges then Recursion was next at 76 million. The smallest was about 4 million it looks like in this SoundHound AI.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, so it's not like they're huge investments necessarily in these companies, but in this current market environment where there's so much enthusiasm around basically anything NVIDIA touches, all of these stocks had big gains today.\n\nThat includes, by the way very, small companies like micro, micro, micro caps like Nano X Imaging, which is a medical imaging development company and TuSimple, which is a self-driving company. I mean, both of those are like micro caps and so it's interesting here.\n\nAnd, you know, both of them seeing gains. Some of these stocks also have high short interest, so you have to take that into account when you look at the reaction here. But it's interesting, this revelation-- I mean, from Arm, which to your point is a huge company that NVIDIA tried to acquire to these very tiny companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: By the way, Dan Ives of Wedbush who we both know has an outperform on SoundHound, and he liked this news. He said this could be, in his opinion, he told his clients this morning, maybe the start of what he thinks could be a broader investment into that company.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Just one quick point of perspective here on SoundHound, by the way, as we have seen this what Peter Boockvar had called a parabola in the stock, right? Right? $13.3 million. Do you know what that number is?\n\nJOSH LIPTON: No, give it to me.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: It's revenue last quarter. Teensy, tinsey company. And maybe there's a lot of room for growth, which obviously is what people are betting on, but it is very, very small right now.",

        "content": "From creating chips for gaming to becoming one of the world's leading AI chip companies, it's safe to say Nvidia (NVDA) is officially one of the tech giants. In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion.\n\nLet's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments.\n\n1993\n\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry.\n\n1997\n\nNvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability.\n\n1999\n\nOn January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share.\n\n2000\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console.\n\n2005\n\nMicrosoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3.\n\n2010\n\nNvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi.\n\n2015\n\nThe company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems.\n\n2016\n\nNvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications.\n\n2018\n\nThe company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing.\n\nThat same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform.\n\n2022\n\nNvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps.\n\n2023\n\nIn May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft.\n\nThe stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share.\n\nFrom a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.\n\nCheck out more of our Beyond the Ticker series, and be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance.\n\nEditor's note: This video was produced byZach Faulds.",

        "content": "The hype around artificial intelligence may be normalizing, according to company earnings calls over the past two quarters.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg and Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk, the number of times that the words \"AI,\" \"machine learning,\" or \"generative AI\" were mentioned on earnings calls decreased from 517 instances in Q4 2023 to just 198 in Q1 2024. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\n\n“The positive effects of technology continue to support firms, consumers and economic growth,” Sløk told Yahoo Finance over email. “The question is if AI is anything special. So far it looks like AI is not a revolution but just a continuation of the tech trend that started in the 1990s.”\n\nMentions of AI spiked at the end of 2022 after ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, launched on Nov. 30. By the first quarter of 2023, tech titan Microsoft (MSFT) announced it had reached a deal between Bing and ChatGPT. AI-related terms were mentioned 268 times on earnings calls that quarter.\n\nBy the second quarter of 2023, Microsoft continued profiting from AI investments while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) unveiled new generative AI products at its I/O conference in May. The number of AI mentions shot up to 532.\n\nThe peak was the third quarter of 2023 — by then, all the Big Tech companies had jumped into the AI fray, and the number of mentions hit 691.\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) particularly benefited from investing in AI during this time, as the company reported a 206% year-over-year increase in revenue. In its earnings release, the company noted that its data center revenue drove the majority of the company’s growth that quarter as it continued unveiling new AI products. A man tests cameras combined with AI at the Quai des Savoirs, where Inria and others are opening a new exhibition in Toulouse on AI titled \"AI double I\". Alain Pitton/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe company has been on an upward trajectory since then. Earlier this week, Nvidia’s market cap surpassed that of both Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) amid news that the semiconductor giant is constructing a new business unit to design chips for cloud computing firms and AI processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith analysts now seeing that all the major tech companies are testing out AI, the concept has become a reality. And to Sløk's point, the question now becomes whether AI is a game changer or simply the natural progression of the internet age.\n\nDaniel Howley contributed to this post.\n\n—\n\nAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and healthcare policy for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. equity options market are betting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report could spur a massive move in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nNvidia, up about 50% this year, could see its shares swing by about 11% in either direction following its quarterly results on Feb. 21, according to data from options analytics service ORATS. That's the largest expected move options traders have priced in ahead of Nvidia's earnings over the last three years and well above the stock's actual average earnings move of 6.7% over that period, ORATS founder Matt Amberson said.\n\nWith Nvidia's market capitalization at $1.8 trillion, a move of that size would make for a potential swing in market value of about $200 billion. That would be greater than the market capitalization of chipmaker Intel Corp and larger than the respective market values of about 90% of S&P 500 constituents.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 750,000 Nvidia options had changed hands by 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), making it the second most actively traded single stock name in the options market.\n\nDespite the sizeable run-up in the stock, demand for upside options bets on Nvidia remained intact, with one measure of sentiment - the stock's 90-day 25 delta call skew - near a five- year high, according to a Susquehanna analysis.\n\n\"The elevated call skew tells us that investors still see the potential for significant upside despite the move already made and that there is significant demand for upside exposure as some who may be fearful of the high volatility turn to upside calls for lower-risk exposure,\" Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia overtook Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.56 a share, and a rise in quarterly revenue to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year ago, according to the mean estimate from 33 analysts, based on LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Leslie Adler)",

        "content": "Investors should keep their ears to the ground for alluring chip stocks.\n\nPositive indicators point to growth in the semiconductor industry in 2024. Initial CHIPS Act funding released in late 2023 stands ready to stimulate the industry, and there’s always the growth potential AI brings to the table that’s worth considering. In particular, investors continue to hone in on the ability for companies to monetize their generative AI capabilities, something that could lead to surging chip demand for some time to come.\n\nOf course, not all chip stocks are created equal. And there are plenty of seasonal hurdles and inventory issues for companies to work through.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, these semiconductor stocks are among the best picks in this sector right now. Let’s delve into the three companies that top the list of highest-potential chip stocks to buy right now.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the leading chip company globally in terms of market capitalization. Recently, it surpassed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) to become the world’s fourth-most valuable company. That’s no small feat.\n\nIn fact, a number of key catalysts drove Nvidia’s rise. Obviously, AI-related chip demand is top of mind for most investors. And, the company is planning a new business segment focusing on customized AI chips for cloud computing and AI to remain unbeatable. With an 80% market share in high-end AI chips, NVDA continues to rocket higher. Further, it appears to have plenty of rocket fuel remaining.\n\nThe company’s H100 and A100 chips provide versatile and high-performance AI processing power for clients. Notably, Nvidia has provided custom chip development for companies seeking tailored solutions. If the company’s clientele continues to demand more personalization, it could drive greater growth than expected.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another key winner in the AI-related surge in the chip sector. The company’s 2024 revenue estimate has already improved, surging to around $3.5 billion from only $2 billion previously.\n\nWhile this is a small piece of the pie relative to Nvidia and other high-performance chip makers, it signals accelerated growth potential. Additionally, it exhibits strong early-stage market share in the AI realm.\n\nAlso, the company cited its enhanced AI positioning and anticipated share gains in the AI GPU market. Analyst Gus Richard predicts accelerated share gains in the AI GPU market, based on the company’s pricing and growth strategy long-term. This may be central to AMD’s recent rise.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s numbers have impressed, with AMD reporting an 11% increase in sales, surpassing estimates by $60 million. It set an ambitious target of $3.5 billion in data center revenue, a 75% jump from its initial $2 billion forecast. Data center revenue towered by 37% year over year (YOY) in the latest quarter, a quarterly increase of 43%.\n\nStrong CPU and data center GPU revenues contributed to this development. Also, AMD’s AI-focused MI300X GPU was introduced, which offers better speed, efficiency, and affordability.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading semiconductor maker Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) has a market cap of $472 billion and an average stock price of $120, as stated by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company serves as the primary supplier of microchips to giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And, the $570 billion semiconductor market is expected to grow 12.2% CAGR through 2029. All indications point to Taiwan Semiconductor playing a major role in this space.\n\nTSM is a leading tech investment due to its steady annual earnings growth of more than 20%, which could go even higher given AI-driven demand. Despite a relatively low price-earnings ratio of around 23x, the company continued yo grow due to AI expansion.\n\nAs the world’s largest foundry, TSM serves major players like Nvidia and AMD, and its strategic location in a geopolitically significant country further bolsters its investment appeal.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Small AI Companies Soar After Chip Giant Reveals Stake",
        "content": "Several firms saw their shares soar on Thursday morning after chip leader Nvidia disclosed investments yesterday evening. In its first-ever 13F filing with the SEC, Nvidia – a leader in the AI space – provided investors with more evidence of its long-term growth plan.\n\nNvidia NVDA has witnessed its own stock soar to new heights, rewarding investors with a 550% return since the depths of the 2022 bear market. With this latest rally, Nvidia has surpassed both Alphabet and Amazon in market capitalization, becoming the 3rd most valuable company in the United States.\n\nSemiconductor stocks have led the way over the past year. Robust demand for products that run cutting-edge artificial intelligence have boosted investor appetite for companies that produce the chips. Several of Nvidia’s customers include fellow members of the Magnificent 7, including Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, as they require thousands of AI chips to run their own advanced offerings.\n\nNvidia’s Mounting Influence\n\nPerhaps the most notable investment that Nvidia disclosed was a nearly $150 million stake in Arm Holdings ARM, the British chip designer that made headlines recently after the stock soared on an EPS beat and strong sales outlook. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nNvidia previously attempted to purchase Arm Holdings two years ago in a blockbuster $80 billion deal, but the agreement turned sour after it hit antitrust issues. The firm was taken private by Japan’s SoftBank in 2016 before returning to the public stage last September. ARM shares had nearly tripled in value from the original IPO price, but a decline over the past few sessions pared some of the gains.\n\nAnother disclosure made was a $3.67 million stake in SoundHound AI SOUN. The company develops AI software that is tailored to vocal recognition, enabling businesses to deliver high-quality conversations to their customers. Their platform offers tools to help brands build voice assistants and automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, and embedded voice solutions.\n\nStory continues StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nSOUN stock surged more than 80% intraday before erasing much of the gains. SOUN was one of the most actively-traded stocks across all U.S. exchanges on Thursday.\n\nNvidia also announced a minor stake in autonomous driving company TuSimple Holdings, a Chinese firm that recently delisted from the Nasdaq. In December of last year, the company announced that it would be closing its part of the business that conducted operations in the U.S. The stock, which is traded over-the-counter, jumped more than 50% early Thursday morning.\n\nA previously disclosed stake in biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) was also reaffirmed in the SEC filing, in which Nvidia invested more than $75 million. In addition, Nvidia divulged shares in Israel-based medical device company Nano-X imaging NNOX, which provides teleradiology services and develops artificial intelligence applications used in medical imaging. NNOX stock nearly doubled in value this morning before shedding much of the gains. StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe AI craze is clearly still underway. But related stocks are getting extended here, so it’s a good time to take partial profits while holding on to the rest to take advantage of any further upside.\n\nNvidia continues to be at the forefront of the AI movement. The chip giant is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is set to report Q4 results next week.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "InterDigital, Inc. IDCC reported relatively modest fourth-quarter 2023 results, with both the bottom line and top line surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company generated lower revenues year over year, owing to declining catch-up revenues. However, healthy improvement in profit margins and record return of capital to shareholders were positive factors.\n\nNet Income\n\nQuarterly net income improved to $39.1 million or $1.41 per share, up from $32.4 million or $1.08 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Despite top-line decline, income tax benefits led to higher net income.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP net income was $37.5 million or $1.41 per share, down from $48.6 million or $1.62 per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, GAAP net income rose to $214.1 million or $7.62 per share from $93.7 million or $3.07 per share in 2022. Non-GAAP net income was $254.4 million or $9.23 per share, up from $154.8 million or $5.08 per share in the prior year.\n\nInterDigital, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nInterDigital, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | InterDigital, Inc. Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nNet sales in the quarter declined to $105.5 million from $117.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The 10% year-over-year reduction was induced by lower catch-up revenues during the quarter. The top line beat the consensus estimate of $104 million.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the company reported total revenues of $549.6 million, up from $457.8 million in 2022.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, total recurring revenues were $103.3 million, marginally down from $103.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales surpassed our estimate of $77.7 million. Smartphone revenues decreased 1% year over year to $88.1 million. Net sales from CE, loT/Auto declined to $17.1 million from $28.2 million in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nTotal catch-up revenues decreased to $2.2 million from $13.5 million. Net sales fell short of our estimate of $26.9 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 18% year over year to $53.3 million. Total operating expenses rose 2% year over year to $80.2 million due to higher general and administrative costs. Operating income fell to $25.3 million from $38.6 million in year earlier quarter.\n\nCash Flow & Liquidity\n\nIn the fourth quarter, InterDigital utilized $23.5 million of cash from operating activities against $356.5 million cash generated from operations in the year-earlier period. In 2023, the company generated $213.7 million of cash from operating activities compared to $286 million cash generated in 2022. As of Dec 31, 2023, it had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $84.3 million of long-term debt and other long-term liabilities compared to respective tallies of $1.2 billion or $660.7 million in 2022.\n\nOutlook\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, InterDigital estimates revenues to be between $245 million and $255 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of $116-$131 million. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be within $2.40-$2.95 per share.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, management anticipates revenues in the range of $620-$670 million. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted at about $310-$345 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected between $7.45 and $8.76 per share.\r\n\r\nManagement expects positive momentum to drive the top line in 2024. The newly inked license agreement with Samsung will likely boost revenues in the upcoming quarter.\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nInterDigital currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2, delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.99%.

        "content": "Some of Wall Street’s biggest investors made new bets on technology giants in the fourth quarter, loading up on stakes in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), however, did not. The conglomerate trimmed its holdings in Apple (AAPL) and HP (HPE) while adding to its stakes in oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). There was at least one additional investment Berkshire kept confidential for now. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett. REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe details about these new bets made in the fourth quarter emerged this week in a series of filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Large institutional investors are required to make these disclosures on a quarterly basis, showing what they bought and sold.\n\nWhat the latest batch showed is that many piled into tech names at the end of 2023.\n\nA hedge fund run by Michael Burry — who famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis and became a central figure in Michael Lewis’s 2010 book \"The Big Short\" — added 35,000 shares of Alphabet and 30,000 shares of Amazon. That fund, Scion Capital, also boosted bets on Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com. Michael Burry of Scion Capital. (Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage) (Jim Spellman via Getty Images)\n\nMany hedge funds also gravitated to the stock of Nvidia, the dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nBridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% as it added more than 220,000 shares.\n\nIt also increased its position in Alphabet by more than 465,000 shares, making it the fund’s 12th-largest position as of the end of December, and added a small stake in Apple.\n\nAnother hedge fund, AQR, increased its stake in Nvidia by 22%. But it trimmed its holdings in Apple and Microsoft, its two largest positions, by 5% and 4%. Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, talks with customers as Apple's Vision Pro headset is displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBerkshire sold just 1% of its holdings in Apple, or 10 million shares, leaving it with a huge stake of more than 950 million shares.\n\nApple has had a rough start to 2024 as it juggled downgrades to its stock price, major changes to its App Store policies, and a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. These challenges mounted as it launched the ambitious Vision Pro headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne other notable investor pared back its exposure to Apple in the fourth quarter: the Soros Fund.\n\nThe outfit started by billionaire investor George Soros and now run by his son closed out a short position and zeroed out of its underlying holdings in the tech giant.\n\nSome of these same investors made some notable bets on the banking industry, especially a regional lender that is currently under a lot of scrutiny: New York Community Bank (NYCB). A branch of the New York Community Bank in Yonkers, N.Y. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Soros fund, AQR and Millennium Capital Management all increased their exposure to NYCB, which surprised Wall Street on Jan. 31 by slashing its dividend and reporting a net quarterly loss of $252 million.\n\nIt is not known what these funds did with their stakes between the end of the fourth quarter and now.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Step aside, Alphabet. Out of the way, Amazon. There’s a new member of the most-valuable companies club in the U.S.\n\nFueled by investor fanaticism over artificial intelligence, Nvidia stock has soared to catapult the company in the market cap rankings. As of the end of trading Wednesday, the chipmaker was the third-most valuable company in America, unseating Google parent Alphabet from that position.\n\nThe climb comes just a day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon.\n\nNvidia, as of 11:00 a.m. EST Thursday, boasts a market cap of $1.8 trillion. (Alphabet sits at $1.77 trillion and Amazon is at $1.75 trillion.) The company is unlikely to advance beyond third place anytime soon, though.\n\nMicrosoft currently boasts a market cap of over $3 trillion and Apple is valued at $2.81 trillion.\n\nIn the global rankings, Nvidia is also bested by the state-owned Saudi Arabian oil company Saudi Aramco ($2.07 trillion).\n\nIn the past two months, Nvidia has seen its market capitalization increase by basically the entire worth of Tesla. The company’s shares are up over 51% year to date as demand for its chips by makers of artificial intelligence tools continues to surge. Nvidia is the top-performing component of the Nasdaq 100 Index this year, just as it was over 2023, when shares more than tripled.\n\nThere certainly seems to be more room to grow as well. Revenue is expected to climb by 120% in fiscal 2024, with another 60% jump expected next year. Earlier this week, UBS lifted its target to $850 from $580, and also increased its estimates for earnings per share. And Mizuho Securities raised its target to $825 from $625.\n\nShares were slightly lower on Thursday, down 1% in midmorning trading.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Investors can't get enough of Nvidia (NVDA). Now, the company is spreading that love to other stocks.\n\nOn Wednesday night, an SEC filing revealed the chipmaking giant held investments in the stocks Arm Holdings (ARM), SoundHound AI (SOUN), and biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) as of Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nAll three of the AI-related stocks popped on the news. Arm, whose stock was already up more than 80% in the last month after the company attributed its better-than-expected revenue expectations to AI initiatives, saw a modest 1% gain on the news. Recursion's stock rose nearly 10%.\n\nMeanwhile,SoundHound, a smaller player that specializes in voice AI and speech recognition, saw a huge gain. The stock was on track for its best day ever at the open, popping about 80% before paring gains to nearly 50% on Thursday morning.\n\nStill, the massive price move in SoundHound, which had been down more than 40% over the last year, reaffirms market enthusiasm for Nvidia and other names associated with the stock.\n\nNvidia shares areup nearly 50% since the start of 2024 and more than 220% in the past year. The company's market cap — which stood at $1.8 trillion as of Thursday midday — recently surpassed that of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) now have a higher valuation than Nvidia.\n\nThe company's revenue has increased significantly over the past year as demand for its AI-powered chips has soared. In the third quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago. The company is set to report quarterly results on Feb. 21.\n\nWedbush Securities senior equity analyst Dan Ives said that Nvidia's investments signal a stamp of approval from the \"Godfather of AI,\" CEO Jensen Huang —and that can go a long way with investors.\n\n\"We view this as a positive indicator for [SoundHound] as this investment now further solidifies the company's brand within the AI Revolution,\" Ives wrote in a note on Thursday morning.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of Dec. 31, Nvidia had a nearly $3.67 million stake in SoundHound. Meanwhile, its stakes in Arm and Recursion totaled just over $147 million and $75.9 million, respectively. Nvidia's logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with AI written in the background.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks that Could be the Next Palantir",
        "content": "Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is enjoying a moment in the spotlight as five consecutive profitable quarters point to a strong and fruitful future ahead, especially compared to many other floundering artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Underperformance is a major problem with AI investing today. Many companies are using buzzwords or throwing an OpenAI ChatGPT wrapper onto a poorly planned product and calling it “innovation.”\n\nThat’s why finding the next Palantir among AI stocks is a tricky proposition. But using Palantir as a roadmap can help. Investors should look to companies operating within niche segments that are delivering otherwise inaccessible value to customers and are able to pivot toward a wider client base.\n\nIn Palantir’s case, the AI-centric company works to un-silo data to draw insight and drive decisions. It is primarily focused on government contracting and is now expanding to greater commercial dominance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDo the same thought exercise for these AI stocks and you’ll see why they may be the next Palantir.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG) stands out among AI stocks as the next Palantir of a unique, less-addressed market: Education Technology (EdTech). The company has evolved from its textbook rental origins to a comprehensive platform that integrates AI for homework assistance and personalized learning tools. These innovations point toward a future where education relies on AI for day-to-day learning. This makes Chegg the next Palantir of EdTech based on common ground. Like Palantir, Chegg is using AI to deliver customized solutions to the end user (in this case, the education system or individual students).\n\nChegg shares are somewhat beaten down today after a poor 2023 showing, marked by a 7% revenue decrease year-over-year (YOY) and slipping subscription rates. But, as the company right-sizes its operational focus and moves firmly away from its research and development phases, expect its already high 68% gross margin to increase. Management expects Q1’s gross margin to be in the 74% range – not bad for a small-cap AI stock still finding its place in the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nChegg also sets itself apart among AI stocks with its shareholder-friendly initiatives, particularly its $200 million share buyback program. This demonstrates a unique balance between aggressive AI growth and financial maintenance through the maturity of its other business segments.\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is the next Palantir of office administration. It’s not too exciting, but UiPath, like Palantir, tops lists of Cathie Wood’s favorite stocks. Similar to Palantir, Cathie Wood thinks UiPath is worth investing in based on how its models unlock existing data that companies aggregate but struggle to operationalize.\n\nIn an interview, she said that UiPath is part of a software-based approach to AI investing because “for every dollar of hardware, we expect 8 to 20 times the amount of software.” Additionally, she emphasizes that “practically every stock in our portfolios [is] especially focused on proprietary data,” and UiPath, in particular, “has proprietary data associated with many companies around the world and the solutions they are evolving to automate these mundane processes.”\n\nOther investors are also excited about UiPath’s potential among AI stocks, saying, “The weaving of Generative AI into its broadened automation platform is driving strong adoption amongst enterprises.” This creates another Palantir linkage, as Palantir increasingly focused on enterprise clients to diversify away from government contracting exclusivity.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a small-cap AI stock that may not stay small for long. The company is bringing AI into oft-overlooked fields within voice recognition, like helping restaurant operations improve order flow through AI voice assistance. Voice recognition is a small but growing field, and as AI stocks like SOUN show us, the total addressable market is as wide as a company can adapt its tech to serve.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) agrees. This week, the AI stock juggernaut announced its multimillion-dollar stake in SoundHound, giving shares an appreciable boost. Nvidia is well-known for investing in promising, early-stage AI companies like SoundHound and Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX). This filing comes on the heels of SoundHound’s 2017 $75 million investment round, to which Nvidia also contributed. This means SoundHound has long been on Nvidia’s radar, even before the current AI boom.\n\nOngoing endorsement from the undisputed overall AI leader indicates that SoundHound has a bright future among AI stocks and could prove to soon be the next Palantir of voice recognition software.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Only 10% of respondents in the survey of more than 400 professionals said their company was not using AI.\n\nNvidia, which on Wednesday eclipsed Google-parent Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company, has seen its business of supplying AI chips boom as companies race to adopt the technology.\n\nSome 66% of the survey's respondents said their companies would boost AI investment in 2024, up from 47% in the survey done a year earlier.\n\n\"We're starting to get some actual, real numbers, meaningful numbers around the impacts (of AI),\" Nvidia's global head of business development for telco, Chris Penrose, told Reuters.\n\nImproving customer experiences is the top priority for telcos in terms AI, with nearly half of respondents pointing to this aspect, with cost reduction and boosting workers' productivity other important factors.\n\nThe biggest roadblocks to implementing the tech in the sector are the lack of data scientists, an inability to quantify ROI (return on investment) and poor technology infrastructure, the report showed.\n\n\"Even if you have data science teams it doesn't mean that they know generative AI,\" Penrose said, adding there is a need to \"bring on the talent, and train the talent\", to work with the tech.\n\n(Reporting by Olivier Sorgho; Editing by Alison Williams)",

We are forecasting a cut much further out simply because there's still too many other aspects of the U.S. economy that are being stubborn,\" Blancato said.\n\nThe data comes on the heels of a warmer-than-expected inflation report that led to more uncertainty about the timing of interest-rate cuts this year. However, investors found some relief after policymakers said price pressures were still moderating, although the path to the 2% target might be bumpy.\n\nWall Street regained some lost ground on Wednesday after an inflation-induced malaise, with the S&P 500 closing above the psychological 5,000-point mark for the third time this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia dethroned Google-parent Alphabet to become the country's third most valuable firm days after it overtook Amazon.com, boosted by the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nComments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, due in the day, will also be scrutinized for their perspectives on the monetary policy easing outlook.\n\nRecently released gross domestic product (GDP) data showed that UK and Japan, two of the world's top economies, slipped into negative growth for two straight quarters.\n\nAt 8:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 69 points, or 0.18%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 5 points, or 0.10%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 15.75 points, or 0.09%.\n\nInvestor optimism was also buoyed by a robust season that saw nearly 80% of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations, LSEG data showed on Tuesday, surpassing an annual average of 76%.\n\nAmong premarket movers, Cisco Systems shed 4.3% as it planned to cut 5% of its global workforce and lowered its annual revenue target to navigate a tough economy.\n\nDeere & Co, the world's largest farm-equipment maker, lost 3.4% after cutting its 2024 profit forecast, while West Pharmaceutical Services tumbled 17.5% after the pharmaceuticals firm forecast full-year results below analysts' estimates.\n\nSoundHound AI jumped 76.0%, while Arm climbed 1.9% after Nvidia disclosed stakes in both AI-related firms.\n\nAlphabet dipped 1.8% after investment firm Third Point dissolved its stake in the megacap, while Apple slipped 0.6% after Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its large stake in the iPhone-maker and Soros Fund Management dissolved its stake in the company.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Nvidia (NVDA) will announce quarterly earnings of $4.51 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 412.5% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $20.18 billion, increasing 233.5% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Nvidia metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Gaming' to come in at $2.68 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +46.3% year over year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Professional Visualization' will reach $428.95 million. The estimate indicates a change of +89.8% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Automotive' should arrive at $276.37 million. The estimate indicates a change of -6% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenue- OEM and Other' stands at $76.69 million. The estimate points to a change of -8.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Data Center' at $16.72 billion.

        "content": "The stock market is at record highs. And more speculative growth names such as artificial intelligence-focused technology firms are skyrocketing. Some analysts are saying we could even see a bubble in the tech sector in 2024.\n\nThe good news, though, is that there are still plenty of rock solid investment opportunities in blue chip dividend stocks for investors today. While the market may be volatile this year, these undervalued dividend stocks are set to prosper for decades to come.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech stocks are on a massive winning streak. Surprisingly, however, there are still some tech companies selling at fair prices while offering solid dividends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one such example. It is the leader in semiconductors focused on the mobile communications space. The company built its business around 3G and 4G patents and infrastructure roll-out. It is now heavily involved in the 5G build-out as well, and it has also diversified into other fields such as its own Snapdragon chipset which powers mobile phones and tablets.\n\nQCOM stock underperformed many of its tech peers over the past year due to a lull in smartphone sales. Telecom companies also slowed their spending on 5G deployments amid lower-than-expected returns on investment.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm has irreplaceable telecom assets. It also has intriguing technology in other fields such as AI-powered mobile semiconductor chips. All this to say that once smartphone sales pick back up, Qualcomm shares should surge toward new highs. Shares also yield more than 2%.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm isn’t the only cheap tech stock with dividends. Networking gear giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is another such example.\n\nCisco, as it turns out, was one of the hottest stocks during the dot-com bubble, and the company briefly became the world’s most valuable firm. Since then, Cisco has dramatically underperformed as internet routers turned from a glamorous field to a commodity. We could wonder whether several of today’s high-flying tech stocks will later turn into commodities and see their valuations tumble in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, Cisco has now become a far more trustworthy investment. Not surprisingly, the company’s revenues have continued to grow as the internet needs more and more infrastructure. The pandemic drove further adoption of technologies such as remote working and studying which drove additional demand for Cisco products.\n\nThe company has wisely pivoted toward software and recurring revenue businesses such as cybersecurity. This should make Cisco more valuable as its revenue mix shifts toward higher margin and more predictable sources. The company also just announced a new partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nEven as Cisco’s business quality has improved, the valuation has remained at a deep discount. CSCO stock sells for just 13 times earnings today and offers a greater than 3% dividend yield.\n\nHormel Foods (HRL) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors will often discard Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) considering that it is most known for its SPAM canned pork product. However, investors should give the protein company a second look.\n\nQuietly, Hormel has totally reshaped its brand portfolio over the past 20 years. It has made numerous acquisitions to pick up products which appeal to millennials and Gen Z shoppers. Hormel is now a leader in low-fat turkey, natural and organically raised meats, Mexican salsas and ready-to-eat guacamole, and nuts and nut butters.\n\nHormel’s unique insight is that it prefers to dominate niche products rather than being one of many competitors in big categories like cereal or cookies. This makes Hormel more immune to threats such as store brands or online commerce.\n\nHormel shares have plummeted over the past 24 months. Margins have fallen as commodity meat prices soared due to the inflationary wave and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Once this normalizes, though, Hormel’s profitability should pick back up. The company has increased its dividend for more than 50 years in a row and shares now yield almost 4%.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a leading dividend stock to own today. Shares of the pharmaceutical giant are selling near multi-year lows and yield more than 6%.\n\nIt’s understandable why investors are frustrated with PFE stock. COVID-19 vaccines have largely run their course, revenues have dropped sharply from the 2021 and 2022 peak years. At first glance, it might seem that Pfizer would be adrift without the vaccine-related revenues.\n\nBut that seems like a mistake. Pfizer’s revenues jumped from $41 billion in 2019 to $58 billion in 2023, and analysts see that rising to $60 billion this year and $63 billion in 2025. That is to say that Pfizer was able to use its vaccine windfall to develop other profitable lines of business and the company should be worth more today than it was in 2019.\n\nInstead, PFE stock is down from $37 to $28 since January 2020. This has made this blue chip healthcare leader a compelling bargain with a huge dividend.\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grass\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the big banks that is thriving among the industry’s current crisis. To be sure, there are some bank stocks which investors should exit today — there are real risks out there.\n\nHowever, Wells Fargo is a safe harbor in the storm. That’s because Wells Fargo did not aggressively expand its balance sheet or buy overvalued securities over the past few years. Banks that were positioned poorly, like First Republic and Silicon Valley, ended up going bust. But the more prudent ones, like Wells Fargo, are poised to profit as the industry consolidates.\n\nThe company just reported another strong earnings result recently. The dividend is rock solid and the bank is buying back lots of stock as well. As the company continues to put its past scandals behind it, shares should rally sharply in coming years.\n\nPinnacle West Capital (PNW) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nPinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) is a U.S. utility holding company that owns Arizona Public Service and Bright Canyon Energy. Investors have generally favored utilities in Sunbelt states such as Arizona thanks to outsized population growth and new industries. The Phoenix area, for example, is enjoying an influx of electric vehicles and semiconductor firms; both of these should bring tons of jobs to the area in the decades to come.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook is bright, PNW stock has entered a short-term slump. Utility stocks, in general, have underperformed due to high-interest rates.\n\nPinnacle West also faces regulatory review from the state’s controversial utility commission. These factors have combined to push PNW stock to near 52-week lows; it yields more than 5% today.\n\nMcCormick (MKC) McCormick & Company spices lined up on a grocery store shelf.\n\nSource: Arne Beruldsen / Shutterstock.com\n\nHormel isn’t the only cheap food stock today. Spice giant McCormick (NYSE:MKC) is another packaged foods company that is on sale.\n\nThe whole category sold off in 2023 in large part due to worries around GLP-1 weight loss drugs. This is understandable to an extent; it’s not hard to see how the weight loss phenomenon could lower sales of soft drinks and junk food.\n\nThis narrative makes no sense for McCormick, however. The company’s bread and butter are spices which have few or no calories. It has also made a big push into hot sauces with its purchases of Frank’s Red Hot and Cholula in recent years. McCormick brings consumers goods which make their foods taste better without adding unnecessary calories. Yet MKC stock has gotten dumped along with the rest of the sector. That has pushed McCormick, a Dividend Aristocrat, to near multi-year lows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in MKC, HRL, WFC, PFE, and QCOM stock.

        "title": "Want Better Returns? Don't Ignore These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Nvidia (NVDA) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.75 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on February 21, 2024.\n\nNvidia's Earnings ESP sits at 5.26%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.75 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.51.\n\nNVDA is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. nVent Electric (NVT) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSlated to report earnings on April 26, 2024, nVent Electric holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.73 a share 71 days from its next quarterly update.\n\nnVent Electric's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.46% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.73.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and NVT could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "3 Machine Learning Stocks That Could Make Your February Unforgettable",
        "content": "Machine learning stocks are only going to become more valuable over time, thanks in part to the AI revolution as well as the expanding use case for these companies. I think that many investors can benefit from having at least some shares of machine learning stocks in their portfolios.\n\nFor this article, I’ve handpicked three of the best machine learning stocks for investors to consider. I narrowed down this list by looking for brands with the most promising prospects and potential upside for their stock prices.\n\nSo here are the best machine learning stocks for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands out in the machine learning landscape, especially after acquiring OmniML to enhance machine learning model deployment for developers and organizations.\n\nThis year, NVDA stock plans on integrating machine learning more deeply for surgery, drug discovery, enterprise data processing and consumer experience use cases. The company will accomplish this by leveraging large language models and generative AI. Additionally, Nvidia focusing on hyper-scale accelerators to boost machine learning throughput for web data centers, addressing the growing demand for AI capabilities in web applications.\n\nAlthough the company trades at 95 times earnings, recent analyst estimates for the stock give it a substantial implied upside. For example, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho maintained his $825 price target, while C J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald rated the stock as “Buy” and reiterated his $775 target.\n\nUiPath (PATH) The UiPath (PATH) app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) outlined its financial outlook for 2024. The company expects revenue in the range of $381 million to $386 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, with an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in the range of $1.450 billion to $1.455 billion as of Jan. 31, 2024.\r\n\r\nThis projection indicates a strong growth trajectory, supported by a year-over-year increase of 24% in revenue and ARR for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt present, PATH’s stock price stands at $24.94, marking a slight decrease of 7.22% over the past five days but an overall increase of 0.40% since the beginning of the year. Despite the somewhat muted share price movement, some analysts categorize it as a “sleeper hit” amidst the AI frenzy.\n\nIn terms of valuation, the forward P/E ratio stands at approximately 47 to 55 times earnings, suggesting expectations of earnings growth within the next twelve months, and it trades at around 11 times sales at the time of writing.\r\nI think that PATH is a buy, given its EPS is forecasted to grow by 10.68% next financial year. Additionally, its top line could swell to $1.31 billion, up 23.94%\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another one of those machine learning stocks that are poised for significant growth this year. The company expects a significant revenue increase of approximately 50% in 2023, with projections ranging from $43 to $50 million.\r\n\r\nAlso, SoundHound AI plans on becoming adjusted EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter of 2023, thanks to a restructuring expected to save approximately $60 million in operating costs.\n\nOn the valuation front, SOUN stock also looks attractive. Its forward price-to-sales ratio of 8 times sales is significantly below the median of its peers, suggesting that it may be undervalued relative to them.\n\nThere have been some recent analyst upgrades for SOUN stock, which could be leaving investors feeling bullish about the company. For instance, Glenn Mattson from Ladenburg Thalmann gave it a “strong buy” rating last month, along with a 75.82% forecasted increase for its stock price to $4.\n\nWith it on track to being EBITDA positive in the near future, SOUN is one of those machine learning stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 15, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, ASML Holdings ASML and Arista Networks ANET.\n\nAI Backdoor: 3 Stocks Quietly Powering the Boom\n\nAlthough we have all become very familiar with the Artificial Intelligence darlings like Nvidia and Microsoft, there are a handful of companies that are quietly powering this revolution, creating the tools and infrastructure that enable AI's remarkable capabilities.\n\nWhile AI advancements grab headlines, these companies play a crucial, yet often unseen, role in its development. Here, we dive into three such companies:\n\nCadence Design Systems, ASML Holdings and Arista Networks.\n\nIt is also worth noting that these companies aren't overly reliant on the burgeoning technology either, as the stocks have been mega-performers in their own right. Cadence Design Systems, ASML Holdings, and Arista Networks have all trounced the broad market over the last decade, further cementing them as worthy investment considerations.\n\nCadence Design Systems: Architects of the AI Chip\n\nImagine intricate blueprints for miniaturized cities teeming with billions of transistors. That's what Cadence Design Systems does, providing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software that helps design and verify complex integrated circuits (ICs), the brains powering everything from smartphones to AI supercomputers.\n\nCadence plays a crucial role in developing the specialized chips needed for AI applications. Their tools enable engineers to create efficient, high-performance AI chips with features like specialized processing units and optimized memory access. As AI demands grow, so too will the need for advanced EDA solutions, potentially boosting Cadence's prospects.\n\nCadence Design Systems currently enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Expectations have been upgraded across timeframes for the chip designer.\n\nStory continues\n\nCDNS stock is already up 10.4% YTD, showing considerable momentum.\n\nASML Holdings: Building the Foundation\n\nAt the heart of chip manufacturing lies ASML Holdings, the undisputed leader in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. These complex machines etch minuscule circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, enabling the creation of ever-denser, more powerful chips.\n\nEUV lithography is crucial for producing the advanced chips needed for AI applications. ASML's dominance in this space positions them as a key player in enabling the AI revolution.\n\nAlthough ASML has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, signaling a mixed earnings revisions trend, it still has a lot going for.\n\nASML sits in the top 7% of theZacks Industry Rank and boasts very impressive EPS growth forecasts over the next 3-5 years. Over that period, earnings are expected to climb 20.3% annually. Additionally, ASML has a near-monopoly in EUV lithography, which has incredibly high barriers of entry and recurring revenues, securing its business future.\n\nThe stock market has been strong since the start of the year, but ASML Holdings has been stronger. The stock is up an incredible 21.3% YTD.\n\nArista Networks: The AI Communication Hub\n\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, efficient communication between data centers becomes crucial. Enter Arista Networks, a leader in high-performance data center networking solutions.\n\nArista's switches and routers are specifically designed to handle the demanding workloads of AI applications, enabling efficient data transfer and communication between AI systems.\n\nAs can be seen in the chart below, both ANET's share price and earnings revision trend have been steadily climbing higher over the past three years. Arista Networks has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, further increasing the odds of another advance in the share price.\n\nANET stock has already rallied 13.7% YTD, demonstrating strong demand from investors.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBecause none of these stocks are household names, investors who can dive a little deeper into the minutiae of the industry can gain a real edge. But don't get it twisted, just because they aren't well known doesn't mean their contributions aren't vital to technological development.\n\nBy enabling the creation of specialized chips, building the manufacturing foundation, and facilitating high-speed data communication, they're laying the groundwork for AI's continued advancement.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Nvidia Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- the undisputed king of AI semiconductor chips -- is priced at $727 per share. Blink and you might miss it. On Tuesday, investment bank UBS predicted that Nvidia's price will reach $850, giving investors a 17% profit before the end of 2024.\n\nIs it too late to buy Nvidia?\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nEven at $1.8 trillion in market capitalization, Nvidia could still gain even more. The stock looks pricey at 95 times trailing earnings, but most analysts agree that Nvidia is growing so fast that its forward P/E ratio stops at 35 times earnings. And with a projected long-term earnings growth rate of 35%, that actually sounds like a pretty fair price.\n\nIs a 17% profit enough?\n\nRaising its price target by 47% (since the last assessment), UBS now sees a further 17% profit in Nvidia stock through the end of this year.\n\nGranted, any investor would prefer to earn a 217% profit on Nvidia stock than just 17%. But who's to say Nvidia stock won't go up 17% this year ... and then keep on going up, perhaps even another 200%? UBS isn't. Its new price target only looks out one year. But it's only been a little over a year since ChatGPT was released for general use, making artificial intelligence the \"new thing\" in investing.\n\nConsidering how very early innings we are in the AI revolution, AI usage looks ready to skyrocket for years to come. And as AI gets used more, more AI chips will be needed to support that usage. Demand is so strong that UBS says Nvidia can raise prices on its chips, even as it grows supply. Nvidia dominates this arena with a market share of at least 80%, so the company looks poised for further growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

However, investors found a modicum of relief after policymakers said price pressures were still moderating, although the path to the 2% target could be bumpy.\n\nData due at 8:30 a.m. ET, including retail sales and industrial production reports for January and weekly jobless claims, is expected to shed more light on the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nComments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic due through the day will also be scrutinized for their perspectives on the monetary policy easing outlook.\n\nBets for at least a 25-basis-point rate cut in May have settled at 40.5%, down from over 60% earlier in the week, while odds for June stand at 82.3%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"The January CPI report injected another dose of reality into investors, indicating the likelihood that the Fed will be 'slower to lower' short-term interest rates,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We think the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will wait to see a broad-based slowing in price pressures before starting its easing cycle.\"\n\nThe recent release of gross domestic product (GDP) data showed that UK and Japan, two of the world's top economies, slipped into negative growth for two straight quarters.\n\nAt 7:17 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 46 points, or 0.12%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.15%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 34.25 points, or 0.19%.\n\nInvestor optimism was also buoyed by a robust season that saw nearly 80% of S&P 500 companies beating earnings expectations, LSEG data showed on Tuesday, surpassing an annual average of 76%.\n\nAmong premarket movers, Cisco Systems shed 4.1% on plans to cut 5% of its global workforce and lowered its annual revenue target to navigate a tough economy.\n\nDeere & Co, the world's largest farm-equipment maker, lost 3.1% after cutting its 2024 profit forecast, while Albemarle dropped 4.1% after the world's largest lithium producer swung to a quarterly loss from a year-ago profit.\n\nRollins' lost 6% after its fourth-quarter organic residential revenue and margins disappointed investors.\n\nSoundHound AI jumped 73.8%, while Arm climbed 1.5% after Nvidia disclosed stakes in both AI-related firms.\n\nAlphabet dipped 1.2% after investment firm Third Point dissolved its stake in the megacap, while Apple slipped 0.7% after Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its large stake in the iPhone-maker and Soros Fund Management dissolved its stake in the company.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.\r\nNow I would like to introduce Sami Badri, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nAhmed Sami Badri\n\nWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year '24 Conference Call. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.\r\nIncome statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons are made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis.\r\nThe matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2024. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.\r\nWith respect to guidance, please feel free to see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.\r\nI will now turn it over to Chuck.\n\nStory continues\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nThanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid Q2 performance with revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove our margins, which exceeded the high end of our expectations and allowed us to deliver better-than-anticipated earnings per share. In Q2, we once again returned a total of $2.8 billion in value through dividends and share repurchases.\r\nWe also announced today another increase to Cisco's dividend payout rate, reaffirming our ongoing commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders through consistent capital returns. Overall, our Q2 results continue to advance our strategic business transformation around driving higher levels of software subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR, both of which showed performance gains in the quarter.\r\nOur pending acquisition of Splunk also further supports our transformation strategy by fueling stronger growth, expanding our portfolio of software-based solutions and generating higher levels of ARR with roughly $4 billion in additional ARR expected upon closing and will make us one of the largest software companies in the world.\r\nBefore turning to our performance in the quarter, I'd like to start by commenting on the demand environment. First, in terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty. As we're hearing this from our customers, it's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations. Second, as we discussed last quarter and subsequently saw in other technology provider results, customers have been taking time since the start of our fiscal 2024 to deploy the elevated levels of products shipped to them in recent quarters, and this is taking longer than our initial expectations. Third, we also continue to see weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers. This industry has seen significant pressure, and they are adjusting deployment phasing, which is weighing on our business outlook.\r\nGiven these factors, we are adjusting our expenses and investments to reflect the current environment. That said, for the product categories in which we can measure customer inventory absorption through connections to the cloud, we are seeing steady progress. However, based on conversations with customers, we still believe we are 1 to 2 quarters away from full implementation of their inventory, which, as I mentioned, is longer than we expected. We continue to track Meraki activations, which are moving slightly faster in wireless and slightly slower in switching. Using our Meraki business as a proxy for our wider enterprise networking portfolio, we expect the current implementation of shipped products to be broadly complete by the end of fiscal 2024.\r\nLooking at our wireless business as an example, we are encouraged by the number of orders of $1 million or more, which increased approximately 50% sequentially in Q2. This indicates that many wireless customers have finished absorbing what we've shipped to them and are preparing for larger deployments in the coming months. Our team is also partnering closely with customers to assist with this heightened focus on deployments of Cisco equipment on hand, contributing to our services revenue increase year-over-year. It's also worth noting that nonhardware-centric revenue in areas such as Security and Collaboration increased, and our Observability offerings grew double digits year-over-year. Finally, despite the near-term challenges, our win rates are stable and on a rolling 4-quarter basis, our market share remained steady in 3 of our 4 largest markets.\r\nNow moving on to our performance in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, our performance in the quarter was broadly in line with or better than our Q2 expectations. Given the trust our customers place in us and the criticality of our technologies to the outcomes our customers are seeking, I am confident about the foundational strength of our portfolio and our future growth opportunities. With our innovation, we deliver and enable our customers to deploy next-generation applications in a highly secure manner.\r\nAs part of this, we help facilitate their growth through our products and services so that when our customers adopt new technologies, we grow alongside them. We continue to accelerate our innovation across high-growth areas. Last week at Cisco Live EMEA, we announced new capabilities in networking, furthering our vision for the Cisco Networking Cloud. We also announced several new capabilities across our Security, Collaboration and Observability portfolios, leveraging AI throughout.\r\nWe also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. This quarter, we announced the next phase in our partnership with NVIDIA to offer enterprises simplified, cloud-based and on-prem AI infrastructure. This includes both networking hardware and software to support advanced AI workloads. We are clear beneficiaries of AI adoption, and this partnership further demonstrates the central role we play in AI and the overall technology ecosystem. Our combined solution will be sold through our extensive global channel with professional services and support from key partners who are committed to helping businesses deploy their GPU clusters via Ethernet infrastructure.\r\nIn webscale, we continue to see momentum with 3 of the top 4 customers deploying our hyperscale Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. While there is tremendous opportunity ahead, we are still in the early stages of adoption of AI workloads.\r\nIn Security, we continue to execute against our product road map to deliver the industry's most comprehensive unified platform with end-to-end solutions. This quarter, we introduced Cisco Identity Intelligence, an analytics layer that pulls data from identity infrastructure and performs behavior-based assessments to help protect against identity-based attacks, which are at the forefront of cyber threats today. AI is also becoming more pervasive across the Cisco Security Cloud. For example, our new AI Assistant and Secure Access lets customers create security access policies using natural language prompts, reducing errors and speeding up policy administration by 70%. Our new security solutions like XDR and Secure Access are ramping quickly after being launched this fall with now over 230 Cisco XDR customers. Over the next 6 months, you can expect more meaningful announcements across the portfolio through our accelerated organic innovation and inorganic investments.\r\nIn addition, we have now extended our AI-powered ThousandEyes into Cisco Secure Access, joining past integrations with AppDynamics, Webex, Catalyst and Meraki platforms. ThousandEyes allows our customers to understand the digital experience of users, applications and things through billions of daily measurements of the Internet and public SaaS as well as thousands of enterprise customers, creating best-in-class digital experiences for users.\r\nIn Observability, we introduced the Cisco Digital Experience Monitoring application, providing deep insights into the performance of browser and mobile applications and efficient resolution of session-level issues. Our continued generative AI innovations build upon our existing platform capabilities, further enabling operations teams to focus on what matters most: minimizing tools for all, improving overall performance and delivering highly secure digital experiences.\r\nGoing back to the pending Splunk acquisition, the combination of Splunk's complementary capabilities with ours and AI, Security and Observability will create an end-to-end data platform to enhance our customers' digital resiliency. We are excited that together, we will bring trusted innovation leadership, an outstanding go-to-market engine and a world-class culture that will help our customers achieve their technology outcomes with innovative products and solutions.\r\nI would also like to provide a brief update on timing. While the closing of the acquisition of Splunk remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, given the positive progress to date on the required regulatory approvals, we now expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of calendar year 2024, which is in our fiscal third quarter.\r\nBefore I turn it over to Scott, let me summarize 3 key takeaways. First, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year given the cautious macro environment, our customers absorbing high levels of inventory and ongoing weakness in service provider. Second, you can count on us to take a disciplined approach regardless of the environment. We remain committed to operating leverage, capital allocation and expense management. Lastly, our portfolio continues to get stronger and stronger every day. While we have work in front of us and despite the current environment, we remain confident in our long-term strategy. We are relentlessly focused on our commitment to driving long-term value for our shareholders and industry-leading innovation for our customers.\r\nI'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nThanks, Chuck. Our Q2 results reflect solid execution again with strong margins and increasing operating leverage. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $12.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $3.5 billion, down 3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was above the high end of our guidance range at $0.87, down 1%.\r\nLooking at our Q2 revenue in more detail, total product revenue was $9.2 billion, down 9%, and service revenue was $3.6 billion, up 4%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 12%. We saw declines across switching, wireless and routed optical networking driven primarily by weakness in the enterprise and service provider and cloud markets.\r\nSecurity was up 3% with our Zero Trust offering growing double digits. Collaboration was up 3% driven by growth in collaboration devices and calling partially offset by a decline in meetings. Observability was up 16% driven by growth across the portfolio with continued strength in ThousandEyes network services. As Chuck mentioned, ThousandEyes helps monitor and assure digital experience everywhere, on-premise, Internet and the cloud.\r\nWe continue to make progress on our transformation to more recurring revenue-based offerings. We saw strong performance in our ARR of $24.7 billion, which increased 6%, with product ARR growth of 9%. Total software revenue was flat at $4.2 billion, with software subscription revenue up 5%. 88% of our software revenue was subscription-based.\r\nTotal subscription revenue increased 6% to $6.4 billion, which now represents 50% of Cisco's total revenue, an increase of 6 percentage points over last year. RPO was $35.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Product and service RPO both increased 12%. In total, short-term RPO was $17.9 billion, up 6%. Q2 product orders declined 12%, a significant improvement from Q1 as customers continue to work down product shipments from prior quarters.\r\nLooking at our geographic segments year-over-year, the Americas was down 10%, EMEA down 8%, and APJC was down 27%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was down 40%, enterprise was down 6%, and public sector was down 5%. Backlog at the end of Q2 has now returned to normal levels.\r\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin came in at 66.7% up 280 basis points year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 65.2%, up 310 basis points. The improvement was driven primarily by lower freight and component costs and favorable product mix partially offset by negative impact on pricing. Service gross margin was 70.5%, up 140 basis points.\r\nNon-GAAP operating margin came in at 33%, up 50 basis points and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong non-GAAP gross margin and continued cost management drove the leverage.\r\nFurther, we are realigning our investments and expenses to reflect the current environment to help maximize long-term value for our shareholders. As part of our announced restructuring plan, we expect to impact approximately 5% of our global workforce with estimated pretax charges of approximately $800 million.\r\nShifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $25.7 billion. Consistent with our expectations, operating cash flow was $800 million driven in large part by the timing of federal tax payments and the higher annual payment of the TCJA transition tax.\r\nThis quarter, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $5.7 billion in value to shareholders, and we plan to continue our share repurchases at the current quarterly level throughout fiscal 2024. Increasing shareholder returns through greater operating leverage, maintaining a higher level of annual share repurchases and growing our dividend is consistent with our capital allocation strategy.\r\nGiven the confidence we have in our business today, we announced we are raising our dividend by $0.01 to $0.40 per quarter. This dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow annually to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows.\r\nTo summarize, we executed well with continued strong margins and increased operating leverage as we help our customers complete record deployments and implementations. We continue to progress our business model shift to more recurring revenue. We are strategically investing in innovation to capitalize on our growth opportunities and are committed to delivering long-term shareholder value.\r\nWith regard to our proposed acquisition of Splunk, we continue to work through regulatory approvals and closing conditions and as Chuck mentioned, we're optimistic that it will close ahead of what we had originally anticipated. We have not included any impact from the Splunk acquisition in our forward-looking guidance.\r\nTurning to our guidance. As previously mentioned, we have reset our expectations for the second half of the year to account for the caution around macro uncertainty, the continued absorption by our customers of record levels of product shipments they received from us and the weakness of our service provider market. For Q3, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86.\r\nFor fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.68 to $3.74. In both our Q3 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.\n\nAhmed Sami Badri\n\nThank you, Scott. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nAmit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nI'll ask both my questions upfront. Chuck, when I think about the lower revenue guide for the full year by about 500 basis points versus 90 days ago, can you just touch on how much of that do you think is the digestion getting extended versus the macro versus the telco weakness? And then how do you sort of think about getting back to a positive revenue cadence organically?\r\nAnd then as a follow-up, I'd love to just understand this, in media announcement you folks had, there's a bit of a perception that it's more about servers, less about networking. I would love for you to just flesh that out, what that means to Cisco.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nAmit, thank you very much. So obviously, with the lower guide, we talked about the feeling that there's some macro uncertainty. We talked to our teams in preparation for this, and they obviously submitted their forecast. And what we really saw was what they previously told us 90 days ago relative to the second half versus what they told us a couple of weeks ago had changed materially, which means customers are pushing things out and putting a little more scrutiny on them. So that's the difference that we've seen.\r\nAs far as trying to break down what percentage comes from each of those -- the 3, including the digestion issue as well as the telco and SP piece, I think it's pretty difficult to do, honestly. However, I will say that we think that the consumption of the elevated inventory levels should be -- we should be through that by the end of our fiscal year. We think that the SP telcos -- the SP telco and cable side of it, we're hopeful that in '25, they will begin investing again. We originally had anticipated that they would begin to invest in the second half of this year, and we no longer believe that to be true.\r\nAnd I think that -- so I think the consumption issue and the SP thing -- or the consumption issue is temporary through the end of the year. The macro thing is one that we're going to have to wait and see and the SP telco probably similarly. And all of these things led us obviously to reset the second half of the year.\r\nOn the NVIDIA partnership, it is definitely Ethernet. I was in the meeting when we first talked about this with Jensen, and he agreed that we would include our Ethernet technology with their GPUs and creating the stack. There will also be servers as well, and there'll be multiple versions of this over time. So -- but it will include our Ethernet technology when they're connecting multiple clusters.\n\nOperator\n\nMeta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMeta A. Marshall\n\nMaybe you've mentioned service provider, but I guess -- just getting a sense of whether you're seeing more weakness on data center or edge or if it comes to kind of the 5 investment priorities that you had noted that enterprises had a couple of quarters ago. Are any one of those areas still getting prioritized significantly versus not getting prioritized significantly? And then just maybe as a second question, how are you seeing enterprises think about AI and think about where the budgets for AI are coming from? Just any commentary would be helpful there.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nYes. Thanks, Meta. So I would say that what we do see customers investing in is clearly cybersecurity. We see Observability as you saw the 16% growth rate. We even saw Collaboration positive this quarter, which was a good sign. They are at various phases of still dealing with this hybrid work situation. We had a very strong quarter with our devices, our video device businesses.\r\nWe see customers investing in their customer experience through technologies like contact center. And so we see a lot of that. We see customers continuing to invest in their application rearchitecture, which leads to both Observability opportunities as well as the re-architecture of their networks to deal with the traffic flows that we've been talking about for a couple of years. I think the real issue right now is that we ship so much networking in our core business that, that's where the challenge is, that they're just trying to get all that implemented right now.\r\nAs it relates to the enterprise and how they're thinking about AI, what I would tell you is that over the last 90 days, we began to see the pipeline for AI use cases in the enterprise began to emerge. And there's heavy work going on in financial services. I would say it's early in what they're trying to think through, but we are seeing opportunities arise. And I think that there have been some comments, not enough for me to translate this to a massive trend, but there were some comments from some of our field teams that they see customers holding budget back just to be ready to expend it on AI once they get their strategy fully baked. So that's about what I could tell you at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nSo maybe I just want to step back for a second, Chuck, and maybe for Scott also. If I look at your guide for this year, I mean, we're basically back to fiscal '19 revenue levels. So I'm just trying to think about how your longer-term model works in the context of that 5% to 7% guide that you laid out at the investor briefing a number of years ago as sort of customers digest product.\r\nObviously, it would suggest that maybe there's some more share loss going on in the core networking portfolio, given some of the other parts of the business has grown. So I just want to kind of try to get a sense of how you're thinking about the portfolio today, given we're kind of back to fiscal '19. And then from a profitability standpoint, obviously, you've done a tremendous job, and I would imagine the cost cutting goes along those lines to keep margins higher. But is there an opportunity to use margin and maybe price going forward to take back some of the share if there's a disruption in the market by a potential strategic transaction in the marketplace today?\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. David, I'll start and then Chuck, you can chime in on share. The way to think about the 5% to 7%, if you go back to when we gave that metric, you remember, it was in 2021, actually pre all of the supply chain volatility that we've seen. And since then, of course, we've seen the supply chain set in, which caused a spike in product orders and then a subsequent big building up of our backlog. As we cleared the backlog, we saw a spike in revenue. And so it's been difficult to look at year-on-year compares as all those dynamics were going on.\r\nWhat we're seeing now is as we've cleared the backlog, and we cleared it very quickly, given the strength of our supply chain team, that bottleneck has just moved downstream. So I don't think you can look at this year's revenue and try to somehow compare it to historical because of all the moving parts underneath the covers. What underpinned that 5% to 7% when we gave it to you was that's the aggregated growth of the TAM of the markets that we play in, right? And so at this point, we still see that as the longer term where we're headed.\r\nI think looking at year-on-year growth rates, I don't think you're going to see those growth rates begin to normalize until we work through the inventory that's in the field right now, which is one of the biggest headwinds we've got, right? And then we can get back to regular ordering and then you need to lap that, right? You need to go 4 quarters out to be able to compare it to a more normalized point. So I think that's the way you need to think about that longer term. But there's no change at this point. We'll update the longer-term model after we finish the acquisition of Splunk and can give you better insight into what we look like as a combined company.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nYes. David, on the share loss, I think if you look at the -- just look at the last published reports that came out after Q...\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\n3, calendar.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nCalendar Q3, in our 4 largest markets -- so if you take campus switching, you take wireless and you take SP routing, we actually gained share. So I don't know where the share loss thesis is coming from. When you look at data center switching, you will see it show up as a share loss. But to be -- we have to understand that one of our major competitors there reports their webscale sales into data center switching, and we report our webscale sales into SP routing. So those turn into sort of apples and oranges categories. But the others, based on the last reports that were put out, we actually have gained share if you look at a rolling 4 quarter even over the last 3 years.\n\nOperator\n\nSimon Leopold with Raymond James.\n\nSimon Matthew Leopold\n\nI've got an easy one and a little bit harder one. I'll start with the easy one and then ask the other. It just looks like your order trajectory is getting somewhat better. So the orders this quarter, down 12%, not too bad. And I know you don't forecast orders, but maybe if you can talk about when you expect orders could turn positive again, given the comparison and the trend.\r\nThe other question I wanted to see if you could discuss how you envision the AI clusters in terms of will the webscale operators choose multiple vendors in a single cluster or will they designate maybe different data centers to different suppliers? Or will they mix and match? How do you see the split playing out, particularly in the hyperscale opportunity? And I really mean this more longer term, '25, '26, not currently when we're dominated by InfiniBand, but when Ethernet starts taking more share.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nYes. Thanks, Simon. So on the order trajectory, I think what -- we clearly don't guide bookings. But what I would tell you is that even as our teams modified their second half outlook, the second half will still be more favorable than the first half. So your assessment of sort of the trajectory, I think, is valid, and I'll leave it at that.\r\nOn the AI clusters, I think it's a good question because what you'll hear is us and competitors talking about a number of webscale players that are using our technology underneath GPUs, our Ethernet technology underneath GPUs. And so I think it's important to remember they always tend to have a dual vendor strategy. They always want 2 sources. And so we're both actually -- the 2 of us are actually playing in this space today. And I'd say today, they're completely homogenous clusters. And I think it's too early to tell whether there will be some benefit over time for them to mix those. My sense is, unless there's something that changes significantly or there's some sort of technology reason for GPUs to be mixed, which I can't speak to at this point, I don't think the underlying network will be mixed. I just don't think there's any benefit for them to do that.\n\nOperator\n\nTal Liani with Bank of America.\n\nTal Liani\n\nI have 2 questions. The first one is Security. The market is great. And we met 2 years ago and 3 years ago when you spoke about new strategy and going to market, but it's still only growing 3%. What is happening there? And what can you do to fix Security and benefit from this market growth? And then maybe I'll ask my follow-up.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nOkay. Thanks, Tal. So I think over the last few quarters, I've been pretty consistent that we thought the second half of this fiscal year, we would start to see an acceleration of Security, and I can give you some highlights where we are seeing some of that -- some green shoots early. Some of the new innovation like XDR and Secure Access, Multicloud Defense suites are -- we're seeing good pipeline build with those technologies.\r\nXDR, we now -- we announced that in April of last year, we shipped it in August, and we have 230 customers, 230-plus customers on the platform today. And the important thing to remember is that it's a big platform play. And we actually typically see that as a 6- to 9-month sales cycle. So to have 230 customers already, I think, is a statement on the value that our customers are seeing. That's going to be a real important integration point with Splunk, by the way. So that we see. We see -- we feel good about the pipeline.\r\nFrom a demand perspective, just to give you some insight, the Americas, the demand was almost double digits this past quarter, which is the highest we've seen in a while. So I think we're seeing a lot of good indicators. And if you just watch over the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to see more and more innovation that comes out. And I think you'll begin to believe and see the results around that same time frame.\n\nOperator\n\nSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nChuck, I'm going to, for my first question, ask you to go back to sort of the drivers of demand that you're seeing here. We walked away from the call last time sensing a sense of optimism about a sharp rebound when you see the inventory digestion complete. But I guess what I'm hearing from you today is even as that inventory digestion ends in fiscal '24, you're seeing a bit more of a macro impact on your customer demand. And are your expectations still sort of intact in terms of thinking about a more sharp rebound as you go into fiscal '25, if you can share what you're seeing from customers there?\r\nAnd for my follow-up, the NVIDIA partnership, how should we think about the impact of that on your AI order target of $1 billion? Or is it really most of that partnership that realizes beyond that sort of target window, target time frame?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nThanks. I would say on the -- the thing that's changed from last quarter is that we do just see a little more caution with our customers. I don't want to over-rotate and say that it's a massive shift, but we definitely saw more caution. We talked with our sales leaders ahead of the call, and they indicate -- we asked them point-blank, was there more caution or the same caution from the prior quarter? And we heard more, a little bit more. And then we saw the pushout of the forecast. So that just tells us that there is a little bit more in the system. So therefore, I think we need a couple of quarters to see it play out before we can declare what's going to happen in fiscal '25.\r\nOn the NVIDIA discussion, a couple of comments. We talked about the $1 billion of orders, which I know someone is going to ask me about at some point. And what I would say is that in the last 90 days, our pipeline of AI opportunities continue to grow. The pipeline is now almost 3x that particular number that we gave last time, which were more orders that we see in '25. The total pipeline is now about 3x that, roughly 3x that. And I would say that virtually none of that is anything associated with the NVIDIA partnership yet. It's all independent of that.\n\nOperator\n\nBen Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nChuck, Scott, I wanted to ask about the HPE-Juniper deal. Are you seeing any uncertainty in the market near term? And how do you think that helps you long term? And if you -- Chuck, if you don't mind, just with regard to that last AI comment, your -- one of your competitors, obviously, is expecting quite a big pick up next year, next calendar year. Do you feel like that AI $3 billion in pipeline or so kicks in next year, next calendar year? Or what's your timing on that?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nThanks, Ben. So I would say on the HPE-Juniper deal, the one area where they have meaningful overlap is in wireless, and I don't know if there's any connection to the fact that we had a 50% increase in $1 million-plus wireless deals sequentially. So it's hard to say. But I mean there is a lot of noise in the system or in the industry about what they do there, but I can't say specifically that any customers have talked to me about it, to be honest. So I think we're -- I think it's a little early for them to -- for the customers to be expressing that concern. They may be asking them directly, but they're not talking to us.\r\nOn the timing, yes, I think we said fiscal '25, which starts in August of this year. And I think you probably should assume most of that is probably in the second half, I would guess, but we'll see how things play out. I think customers are going to move as fast as they possibly can, but we're still in the early strategy and planning stages right now on most of it. The pipeline stuff are well-defined use cases that are already in place with certain customers, and we're actually just working through the opportunities.\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. But Ben, our expectation is the majority of that $1 billion in orders will turn into revenue in our fiscal '25, just to be clear.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\n\nMatthew Niknam\n\nI'll keep it to one and one follow-up. So main question, just around inventory digestion. Is that dynamic primarily affecting enterprise and commercial customers? And can you talk a little bit about the visibility you've got towards this actually resolving itself by fiscal year-end? And then a follow-up just on gross margins. You were fairly stable sequentially, and I think the guide implies more of the same. So I'm just wondering, are we now largely past a lot of the supply chain dynamics or headwinds? Or has anything changed on the supply chain front?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nYes. So I'll take the first, and then Scott, you can take the second. On the inventory digestion issue, I think it's -- I would say it's largely an enterprise and a service provider issue. And particularly the cloud providers, we think they've got probably in excess of 20-plus weeks of inventory that they're working through right now as they built up when the lead times were so long.\r\nWe have a lot of our enterprise products that are tethered to the cloud for management perspectives. And so we see the lag between when we ship it to the customer and when they connected. I gave the Meraki example in my prepared remarks. And so we do have visibility, and we can actually see on some aspects of the portfolio how the time frame between shipments and connectivity is shrinking, and it's not shrinking as fast as we thought it would, which leads us to believe this is going to extend through the end of '24. So that's where we are. Scott, gross margins?\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. What you saw in the quarter is, of course, gross margins continue to show a year-on-year improving trend, roughly flat, as you said, sequentially. There's a couple of dynamics. But to your question on where does this settle in, I think it settles in, in the range we're in right now, in the 66% to 67% range through the end of the year. There's both the things that are happening from a freight and delivery standpoint, freight costs with what's happening in the Red Sea have gone up slightly, and we continue to see a little bit of component pressure, although in the commodity sections, we're seeing some benefit there.\r\nThe scale of the services ramp-up, as you -- obviously, services revenue trails the product revenue. We had those 3 really strong quarters of product revenue growth. We're seeing the tail of that now in our services revenue growth. And since a lot of the cost underneath our services are fixed, you get better leverage when that happens. So I think when you add all those together, we should settle in, in the 66% to 67% range. And the majority of, if not all of the supply chain constraints that we felt are behind us at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nI just have 2. First, just on the revenue guidance. I think based on the midpoint of it, the implied fiscal 4Q revenue guidance only implies about plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. Given that we're back to a normal backlog, what's preventing that from going back to a more normal level of seasonality? And then as a follow-up to Amit's question earlier on the NVIDIA AI deal, I just wanted to clarify. I understand that it's Ethernet, but will it be both NVIDIA's Spectrum-X as well as Cisco's Ethernet? And how will that be sold together, if that's the correct assumption?\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nMichael, on the midpoint of the revenue guide, the math would lead you to what you just said. I think no one ever wants to have to reset guidance, much less have to do it twice. We -- as Chuck just said, as we look at all the various factors coming in from the field, we see caution. And I think you should expect that there's caution in our guide at this point.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nOn the NVIDIA front, I think, look, one of the key benefits that they see is leveraging our enterprise go-to market and our global ecosystem and partner community. And therefore, when we are -- when these solutions are flowing through our channels and our sales teams and our partners, it will be Cisco Ethernet.\n\nOperator\n\nGeorge Notter with Jefferies.\n\nGeorge Charles Notter\n\nI guess I'm just curious about -- are there any mechanisms or activities you guys are using to help accelerate the clearance of inventory from the channel? Any price discounting, any rebating, stock rotation? How are you taking an active approach here?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nI'll comment -- I'll make one quick comment. I think I said this in my prepared remarks as well. We've deployed a lot of transaction services for some of our larger customers just to help them do that. And I know that our sales teams were talking this week, Scott, maybe you remember or you have some more detail on looking at some partner incentives to help?\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. We absolutely are working with the field on that. In a lot of cases, it boils down to a lack of the skilled resources required at both -- sometimes at our partner level, sometimes at the customer level to get that done. There's only so much you can do to accelerate it. We have put in place incentives to make that accelerate. To your other point on cancellations or stock rotation, we're seeing those continuing to be well below where they were prepandemic. So we're not seeing any of that -- any pressure on that front.\n\nOperator\n\nWoo Jin Ho with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nWoo Jin Ho\n\nGiven that most of the weakness is going to be on the networking side, could you just talk a little bit more about the future software subscription renewal rates? You did a good job this quarter with software subscriptions going up 5%, but given that networking is poised to be down, I'm curious where that's heading going forward.\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. I think -- thanks for the question, Woo Jin. I think the way to think about it is we put a -- as you can imagine, when you built up the level of annualized recurring revenue that we have, we've put a huge amount of focus on both customer success and driving adoption and then turning that adoption into renewals. We've invested fairly heavily in that space over the last couple of years, and we're seeing renewal rates respond accordingly.\r\nWhen you look at where we're more software-heavy outside of networking, but in both security and collab, as you saw, we reported growth -- revenue growth in both of those categories. Observability is almost exclusively software, and we posted 16% revenue growth in observability. So we are seeing that actually trend in the right direction.\n\nOperator\n\nTim Long with Barclays.\n\nTimothy Patrick Long\n\nOne question, one follow-up. So first, maybe, Chuck, can you talk a little bit about the kind of margin growth trade-off with the head count reduction? Obviously protecting margin here, but how do you think about that trade-off given the challenging growth we've seen? And then just on a follow-up with all of the AI comments, Chuck, could you just remind us kind of where we are with -- from a product standpoint, are you seeing more traction for Silicon One or software or the full system products? If you could just give us a little color on kind of where you're seeing that pipeline growing?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nYes. Thanks, Tim. So on the margin growth trade-off, we're always considering that, and we're very disciplined, though. And we think that gross margins are clearly a reflection of the value that your customers see and your technology and what you deliver. And if you look at a lot of our competitors and you look at some of the market share -- I mean, some of the gross margins that they have, that tells you that they're viewed more as a commodity. And I think that our customers see real value in what we deliver to them. So while we always look at margins versus growth, we also are -- we're just disciplined across both.\r\nOn the AI front, Silicon One is a big play, clearly. We've delivered next-generation silicon into several of the cloud providers right now. We've got the Ethernet running in 3 of the 4 big ones. And we'll use the same silicon in the enterprise data center over time.\r\nWe've got GPUs in our UCS platforms. And so it's evolving, but we have -- I tell our teams, unlike the original cloud transition that we talked on this call several times about how we were not prepared for the infrastructure play in the cloud world, I think we are absolutely ready and well equipped to succeed in this transition to AI. It will be a tailwind for us as we get into it over time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nI'll stick to one, just building on that last question. I know over periods of time, you've talked a little bit about how large your webscale business is. Can you just remind us again the presence you have in some of the webscale opportunities either from a size -- and maybe ex the AI discussion, what kind of growth rates you're seeing, particularly with those webscale customers right now?\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\nSo our team measures what -- their use cases or franchises or however you want to think about it, there are specific areas within the infrastructure that we identify for each of the webscale players. And Scott, keep me honest, I want to say we're designed into 16 or...\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\n21.\n\nCharles H. Robbins\n\n21 of those. And so that's how I would think about it. I don't think that right now, if you looked at the growth numbers, they wouldn't be reflective of what's going on because they're just digesting inventory right now. So they're not in a position where they need to order a lot because lead times have normalized so much. So I don't think that's -- it's not even relevant. I think understanding those 21 use cases -- and as I said earlier, they want dual source, and they want dual source all the way down to the silicon level. In the traditional days with carriers, they wanted 2 vendors who would provide 2 different integrated systems. In this case, that may be the case with cloud, but they also look at silicon. They look at components. They're very deep on wanting to make sure that they have resiliency and optionality.\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nAaron, the only thing I'd add is, and we said it earlier, there's no question that over time, given the way we're positioned, both from a complete box, a white box and a silicon standpoint, there's no question that AI is a tailwind for us longer term.\n\nOperator\n\nJames Fish with Piper Sandler.\n\nJames Edward Fish\n\nScott, based on a couple of comments you made around gross margins. Just wondering, was supply chain starting to go the other way and supply more readily available? Could we see the price increases enacted in the past now have to be given back? And any sense to how should we think about the annualized cost savings on these reductions, understanding there are people here and it's difficulty and what areas you guys expect to kind of reduce down and if some of those reductions are filled elsewhere in terms of like a net basis on head count?\n\nRichard Scott Herren\n\nYes. On the price declines, you got to remember, go back to why we put the price increases in to begin with. And that was really to offset the higher cost that we were seeing from many of our suppliers as everyone was dealing with constraints, and supply/demand is pretty straightforward.\r\nWhat we haven't seen in the wake of this, some of the commodities, the prices have come down. Memory is a good example. What we haven't seen broadly is cost decreases coming in from our providers at this point. And so with that -- and you see that reflected in our gross margins, which have returned to a more normal range, but are still sitting in that 66% to 67% range. So I'm not anticipating at this point price declines, pending significant cost declines coming into us.\r\nOn the cost savings, you can see where we are year-to-date. We've got a -- if you just look at operating expenses for a minute, year-to-date, operating expenses are modestly up. And after working our way through the restructuring that we discussed today, for the full year, we think they'll be modestly down. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it as you're looking to build your model.\n\nAhmed Sami Badri\n\nThank you, Jim.

Significant revenue and earnings growth have stirred optimism. Guidance suggests revenue will more than triple YOY.\n\nThe midpoint for the company’s diluted EPS guidance came in at $5.215. This figure represents a 241% YOY growth rate. Rapid net income and revenue growth suggest a low forward P/E ratio. Shares currently trade at a 52 P/E ratio which isn’t high for a company with Supermicro’s financial growth and runway.\n\nCharles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro, offered encouraging remarks that demonstrate high retention and soaring demand. “While we continue to win new partners, our current end customers continue to demand more of Supermicro’s optimized AI computer platforms and rack-scale Total IT Solutions,” he said.\n\nAttracting new customers while generating more money from your existing customers is a winning business model.\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) has built a vast platform with 13,000 networks that keep websites up and protect clients from cyberattacks. The company has over 189,000 paying customers who generate annual recurring revenue for the company. More than 60% of the company’s revenue comes from large customers. Q4 2023 featured a 35% YOY increase in that segment. The company closed the year with 2,756 large customers.\n\nThat wasn’t the only highlight from the fourth quarter of 2023. Cloudflare grew its revenue by 32% YOY while signing its largest new customer and its largest renewal contract. The company expects to generate $1.65 billion at the midpoint of its fiscal 2024 guidance. This midpoint suggests a 26.9% growth rate from the company’s $1.30 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue.\n\nMatthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, cited “robust momentum with large customers, significant progress in the public sector, and growth in Cloudflare One” as catalysts for Q4 results. These tailwinds should help the stock march higher.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto.

Shares are up by 112% over the past year and have gained 628% over the past five years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is emerging from the other side of macroeconomic headwinds and should return to high growth shortly. The company demonstrated progress by reporting 10% YOY revenue growth in Q4 2023. That’s much better than the company’s 4% YOY revenue decline for all of 2023.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices achieved $667 million in GAAP net income in that quarter. The net profit margin exceeded 10% and can expand as the company’s AI initiatives play out.\n\nAMD has a vast portfolio of software and hardware solutions that make AI possible. It can help corporations use AI tools and generative AI to fuel more demand for their products. Artificial intelligence is in its early stages and has a large addressable market. AMD stands to benefit from AI tailwinds.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, SMCI, and NET.

        "title": "Not Just Nvidia! 7 More Stocks Hitting New Highs",
        "content": "“Magnificent Seven” components like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) aren’t the only stocks hitting new highs. As of this writing, plenty of stocks outside of the “Magnificent Seven,” and outside of the tech sector, for that matter, have recently hit record highs.\n\nGiven that major indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have hit new highs this month, this is not surprising. However, several stocks are continuing to hit new high watermarks, even as, in recent trading days, the broad market has pulled back, following the release of a hotter-than-expected inflation print.\n\nCompany-specific catalysts are helping these stocks reach new heights, even as another wave of macro uncertainty has potentially hit the stock market once again. The question now, however, is whether this strong performance can continue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo find out, let’s take a look at seven of these stocks hitting new highs, and see whether their latest moves are an invitation to buy, or a warning to sell.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that, over the past year, shares in apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) have been on fire. This stock has surged 276.3% during this time frame. In recent trading days, it has remarked on a sharply upward trajectory.\n\nImproved fiscal results have been the key factor driving ANF stock dramatically higher. While full year results aren’t expected until March 6, forecasts call for ANF’s earnings for fiscal year ending January 2024 to come in at $6.10 per share. For reference, ANF reported earnings of just 6 cents per share last fiscal year.\n\nStill, while Abercrombie & Fitch has been a profitable turnaround stock, it may be high time to cash out. As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek argued last month, it may not take much to cause operating performance to weaken again. This would likely cause a massive reversal for shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,BRK.B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the stocks hitting new highs lately. Admittedly, it may not be 100% accurate to say that Berkshire, legendary investor Warren Buffett’s main investing vehicle, is a non-tech stock.\n\nAfter all, investing in BRK.B provides you indirect exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Berkshire owns a 5.8% stake in the iPhone maker, worth around $167.6 billion.\n\nThat represents nearly 20% of the holding company’s total market cap. As you likely know, Berkshire owns a smattering of companies across multiple sectors, as well as positions in numerous publicly-traded companies.\n\nSo, with BRK.B stock knocking it out of the park lately, is it time to buy? It depends. Though some (like this Seeking Alpha commentator) believe the stock can sustain its current premium to book value (around 65%), waiting for weakness may be a better move.\n\nDiamondback Energy (FANG) Diamondback Energy (FANG) logo on its website to represent oil stocks. FANG stock\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrude oil prices have only partially recovered recently, and natural gas prices have been trending sharply lower. However, that hasn’t stopped shares in oil & gas exploration and production company Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) from performing strongly lately.\n\nOf course, it’s been merger news, not energy prices, that have resulted in FANG stock climbing to a new all-time high this week.\n\nOn Feb. 12, Diamondback announced plans to acquire Endeavor Energy Resources, in a cash and stock deal. Including the value of Endeavor’s outstanding debt, this merger has a transaction value of around $26 billion.\n\nWall Street has reacted positively to this deal news. In large part, due to the perception that, by buying Endeavor, Diamondback is further strengthening its Permian Basin asset base.\n\nAs this deal could help FANG sustain high levels of profitability and its return of capital efforts (dividends and buybacks), more upside may lie ahead.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group (IBKR) close up of one hundred dollar bills\n\nSource: Ruslan Ivantsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on recent trends, it’s not surprising that Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ:IBKR) have been performing particularly well lately.\n\nAs InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently pointed out, the stock brokerage firm is benefitting from both high interest rates and the emergence of a new bull market.\n\nHigh interest rates are benefitting IBKR, as these have resulted in higher interest income on uninvested funds held in customer accounts. Increased stock market participation has resulted in Interactive Brokers’ monthly transaction volume. After becoming one stock hitting new highs, will IBKR stock keep climbing?\n\nCurrent trends may persist, as rates remain elevated, but investors still get back into “risk on” mode, in anticipation of lower rates down the road, creating further transaction volume growth. Last year, there was also talk of IBKR being an AI play. Further developments supporting an AI-related bull case for IBKR could also help shares keep trending higher.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylight\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV stocks have been tumbling. Shares in U.S.-based incumbent automaker stocks have been moving higher, but shares in Japan-based global automotive giant Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) have been performing especially well lately.\n\nHowever, don’t assume that the out-performance of TM stock will continue. As a Barron’s commentator recently argued, it’s possible that Toyota shares have performed well, simply because the company did not hype its EV pivot. U.S.-based automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are suffering in the aftermath of the “EV bubble.”\n\nToyota’s earnings are expected to be flat during the upcoming fiscal year (ending March 2025). Unless further news about the company’s plug-in and battery electric vehicle production ramp-up efforts really excite the market, TM stock’s hot run (shares are up 60.6% over the past year) could soon end.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe phrase “trash is cash” has really held true lately, for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) a leader in the (what else) waste management industry. Shares are up 30.6% over the past year, and recently spiked after reporting strong quarterly results.\n\nWaste Management has become one stock hitting new highs. Several factors may explain why the market has become very bullish about WM stock.\n\nThese include the recession-resistant nature of its business, and the company’s continued steady earnings growth. However, as a result of this excitement, WM has become pricey.\n\nShares currently trade for 29 times forward earnings. That’s well above WM’s historic earnings multiple in the high-teens/low-20s.\n\nIf interest rates come down lower this year as expected, this valuation may be sustainable. If not, though, this stock could be at risk of experiencing a moderate de-rating to a lower valuation.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeak outlook led to a post-earnings tanking for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last November, but shares in the leading retailer just this week completed a recovery, hitting new all-time highs.\n\nThat said, what’s likely been driving this strong performance could be a warning sign to treat carefully.\n\nHow so? Next week, Walmart releases its earnings results for the quarter ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares have moved higher, to some extent, on the expectation that robust spending during the holiday season means an increased likelihood that the company will beat on earnings. However, if results (or updates to guidance) fail to wow the market, WMT stock could quickly give back its latest gains.\n\nThat’s not to say that Walmart will soon retreat back to the low $150s per share, but if you’ve been looking to enter a long-term position in the retailer, a much better entry point could soon emerge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Nvidia dethroned Google-parent Alphabet to become the country's third most valuable firm days after it overtook Amazon.com, as the excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) grows.\n\nEarlier in the week, signs of sticky inflation added to uncertainty about the timeline of rate cuts this year. However, investors found a modicum of relief after policymakers said price pressures were still moderating, although the path to the 2% target could be bumpy.\n\nData due at 8:30 a.m. ET, including January retail sales, industrial production and weekly jobless claims, are expected to shed more light on the economy's health.\n\nComments from Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic due through the day will also be scrutinized for their perspectives on the monetary policy easing outlook.\n\nBets for at least a 25-basis-point rate cut in May have settled at 40%, down from over 60% earlier in the week, while odds for June stand at 82.3%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"The January CPI report injected another dose of reality into investors, indicating the likelihood that the Fed will be 'slower to lower' short-term interest rates,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.\n\n\"We think the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will wait to see a broad-based slowing in price pressures before starting its easing cycle.\"\n\nThe recent release of gross domestic product (GDP) data showed that the UK and Japan, two of the world's top economies, had slipped into negative growth for two straight quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 5:49 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 52 points, or 0.14%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 5 points, or 0.10%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 11 points, or 0.06%.\n\nWith much of the earnings season completed, investors awaited reports from West Pharma, Deere, PBF Energy Zebra Technologies and Wendy's Co before the bell.\n\nInvestor optimism was also buoyed by a robust season that saw nearly 80% of the companies beating earnings expectations, LSEG data showed on Tuesday, surpassing an annual average of 76%.\n\nAmong premarket movers, Cisco Systems' stock shed 5.2% after the company said it would cut 5% of its global workforce and lowered its annual revenue target as it navigates a tough economy.\n\nRollins' fourth-quarter organic residential revenue and margins disappointed investors as cold weather dampened demand for its pest control services, sending its shares down 6.4%.\n\nAlbemarle dropped 5.2% after the world's largest lithium producer said it had swung to a quarterly loss from a year-ago profit due to plunging prices of the ultra-light metal.\n\nSoundHound AI jumped 73.4%, while Arm climbed 3.7% after Nvidia disclosed stakes in both AI-related firms.\n\nAlphabet dipped 1.5% after investment firm Third Point said it had dissolved its stake in the megacap.

        "content": "(Reuters) — Nvidia's bet on smaller AI firms from healthcare companies Nano-X Imaging and Recursion to chipmaker Arm Holdings boosted their shares in premarket trading on Thursday.\n\nNvidia, the biggest winner of the AI boom, revealed its new stakes in the firms as of Dec. 31 in a 13-F filing with the U.S. SEC late on Wednesday.\n\nFellow chip designer Arm Holdings drew the biggest investment from Nvidia, worth $147.3 million.

        "content": "Investors can purchase undervalued dividend stocks to form the backbone of any portfolio. I say this because these stocks are generally low-beta and represent blue-chip companies.\n\nGrowth stocks com with a high-beta and significant uncertainties related to cash flows. Of course, it’s a mix of growth and dividend stocks that help in creating a quality portfolio.\n\nWithin the dividend stock space, this column investigates names that are also trading at a valuation gap. Being undervalued dividend stocks, I expect high total returns from these names in the next three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip dividend stocks generally trade at a premium valuation. However, there can be industry or temporary company specific headwinds that translate into a valuation gap.\n\nThese undervalued dividend stocks opportunities do not come easy and should therefore not be ignored. It’s likely that some of these dividend stocks outperform growth stocks in term of total returns. A good example is the big rally in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock in the last 12 to 15 months.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock has slipped by 33% in the last 12 months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 21.5, the stock looks undervalued and offers a robust dividend yield of 4.77%.\n\nI remain optimistic about potential expansionary policies later this year. As gold trends higher, NEM stock is likely to surge from oversold levels.\n\nIn November 2023, Newmont completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining to create the world’s leading gold mining business. With the closing of the acquisition, Newmont expects to achieve $2 billion in “cash improvements through portfolio optimization in the first two years.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Newmont has an investment grade balance sheet that allows for aggressive investment in exploration. Reserve replacement is likely to remain robust. For Q3 2023, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming that gold trends higher, OCF is likely to be more than $5 billion this year. This is one of the undervalued dividend stocks to buy for growth.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T logo on wooden background\n\nSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) stock has made a small comeback with an upside of 18.5% in the last six months. AT&T, however, remains one of the deeply undervalued dividend stocks at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.7. Further, the dividend yield of 6.52% is attractive, and I believe dividends are sustainable.\n\nThe first point to note is that AT&T reported free cash flow of $16.8 billion for 2023. Further, the company has guided for FCF of $17 to $18 billion for this year. Strong cash flows provide headroom for dividends and AT&T has been deleveraging on a continued basis. The target is to achieve net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.5x in the first half of 2025.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that with some investments in the last five years, AT&T has a strong 5G and fiber network in the United States. This has translated into continued growth in phone and fiber subscribers. I expect this trend to sustain on the back of 5G adoption.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock has been in a downtrend with the decline in revenue from the vaccine against covid-19. It seems that the correction is overdone and PFE stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.4. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 6.07%.\n\nIt’s worth noting that for 2023, Pfizer reported a record number of nine new molecular entity approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This sets stage for heathy growth in the coming years. Further, Pfizer has a product pipeline of 112 candidates with 31 molecular entities in Phase three. This will ensure that Pfizer is back on track for growth. As a matter of fact, the company has guided for 3% to 5% year-on-year growth for 2024.\n\nThe company has been active on the acquisition front. Pfizer expects $25 billion in incremental revenue from new business deals by 2030. With the recent completion of the acquisition of Seagen, the company has boosted its oncology pipeline.\n\nChevron Corporation (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe factors of macroeconomic headwinds and tight monetary policies have translated into a correction for oil.\n\nI see this as a good opportunity to accumulate some of the best oil and gas stocks. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is a top name to consider and trades at a valuation gap. CVX stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 4.29%.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Chevron has an investment grade balance sheet, and that’s one reason to like to stock. Further, the company’s oil assets have an attractive break-even. This translates into robust operating and free cash flows. For 2023, Chevron reported $35.6 billion in operating cash flows.\n\nRobust cash flows position the company for aggressive investments and healthy dividend growth. Once it completes the acquisition of Hess Corporation, the company is targeting $16 to $18 billion in annual capital investments.\n\nAnother important point to note is that Chevron has guided for average annual free cash flow growth of 10%. This sets stage for healthy dividend growth in the coming years. Also, if expansionary monetary policies are pursued later this year, I expect oil to surge higher.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO) the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong industrial commodity stocks, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.3. RIO stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 5.2%.\n\nDemand worries from China is one concern for Rio Tinto. However, if global GDP growth remains sluggish, expansionary monetary policies are likely. This will support growth and potential upside in commodities and energy.\n\nRio reported operating cash flow of $7 billion for the first half of 2023. The iron ore segment remains the cash flow machine and healthy OCF ensures stable dividends.\n\nHowever, I like the fact that Rio Tinto is focused on portfolio diversification. In the next five years, I expect meaningfully higher production of metals that support energy transition.\n\nThis includes the likes of copper, aluminium, titanium, and lithium. With high financial flexibility for investments, Rio Tinto is well positioned to benefit from investments in global decarbonisation.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith rising geopolitical tensions, I would hold at least one defense stock in my core portfolio. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and looks undervalued. LMT stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.94%.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, Lockheed Martin reported a record order backlog of $160.6 billion. The backlog provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For the current year, Lockheed has guided for free cash flow of $6 to $6.3 billion.\n\nWith the order intake remaining strong, it’s likely that FCF will be higher in 2025 and beyond. This will ensure steady dividend growth.\n\nLockheed has the flexibility to invest in next-generation defense technology. This includes hypersonic solutions, next-generation interceptors, spectrum dominance, and space technology.\n\nA recent report indicates that only 35% of NATO countries meet the Group’s defense spending target. This underscores my view on healthy backlog growth and a positive outlook for LMT stock.\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlbemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock has plunged by almost 60% in the last 12 months. The reason is a sharp correction in lithium.\n\nI see this decline as an opportunity to accumulate and ALB stock looks undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5.6. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 1.33% and I expect healthy dividend growth once lithium makes a comeback.\n\nEven with depressed lithium prices, Albemarle reported 10% year-on-year growth in revenue for Q3 2023 to $2.3 billion. The company has also guided for positive operating cash flows of $600 to $800 million for 2023. With cost cutting measures underway, I don’t see any financial stress for Albemarle.\n\nHowever, it’s likely that expansion plans will be delayed to moderate the capital investments. Albemarle had earlier planned to triple lithium conversion capacity to 600ktpa by 2027 as compared to 2022. With the long-term outlook for lithium remaining positive, I am bullish on a strong reversal for ALB stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Growth investors went through a tough stretch in 2022 that saw the Nasdaq Composite fall more than 35% at its low. That feels like the distant past after the technology-heavy index roared back in 2023 with 43% gains. It now trades just 2.5% from its all-time high.\n\nHistory indicates investors could be in for more good times in 2024. The index has historically performed well following similarly large drawdowns throughout the past.\n\nThe excitement for artificial intelligence (AI) advancements helped give a turbo boost to the market's rally. And some leading AI stocks still have the growth potential and reasonable valuations to continue their strong momentum.\n\nHere are three AI stocks to consider buying for continued gains.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe stock market's momentum has been carried by \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a handful of megacap technology stocks leading the charge into AI with their dominant business models and deep pockets.\n\nOne of them is chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), one of Wall Street's best performers after surging 222% over the past 12 months. You shouldn't typically buy a stock after such a run, but Nvidia's accelerated growth from AI chip demand could be unprecedented.\n\nHow often does a company, already doing billions of dollars in sales, accelerate to a triple-digit growth rate? But that's precisely what Nvidia did.\n\nMore importantly, the momentum looks like it could continue. The company controls the lion's share of the AI chip market, which could grow to over $400 billion over the coming years.\n\nNot only are Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips the go-to hardware for building AI computers, but the company is also aiming to go after the custom chip market, targeting companies that might design and build their own AI chips.\n\nAnalysts believe the business will grow earnings at over 42% annually, which means that paying a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) figure of 35 for the stock is very reasonable. Sure, investors who have already seen tremendous gains could take profits. Still, Nvidia's outlook makes any pullback a fantastic long-term buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best strategy might be to buy a little at a time, since there's no telling how far a runaway stock with such strong fundamentals could rise before it does dip.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nLike Nvidia, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is undergoing a growth spurt that investors might struggle to wrap their heads around because shares have moved so quickly.\n\nThis stock is up 751% over the past year alone. But as you'll see in a moment, the unprecedented tailwinds of AI are justifying these gigantic gains. Super Micro Computer sells modular server systems, which means its customers buy turnkey state-of-the-art servers without having to design and build such systems themselves.\n\nThe company has been in business since 1993, and the migration to cloud computing -- and now AI -- is taking growth to new levels. It recently reported its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue grew 103% year over year to $3.66 billion, and 73% over the prior quarter.\n\nThis is exponential growth from a multibillion-dollar corporation, and management is guiding for over 200% year-over-year growth in the third quarter.\n\nWhen revenue is multiplying like this, it shouldn't be jarring to see the stock doing the same thing. Analysts expect big things from Super Micro Computer, and they estimate earnings will grow at an average annual rate of 37%. At a forward P/E of just 34, that's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio under 1, making this highflier a potential bargain if it continues to perform like this.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nAnother Magnificent Seven stock wraps up this list. Social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has soared 163% over the past year.\n\nIt also has a lot going on with AI, but Meta is more a story of redemption after its advertising struggles and excessive spending had it fall out of favor with Wall Street in 2022. Since then, Meta has bounced back, and cost-cutting has re-established it as a cash cow.\n\nMeta, which owns social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, continues to gain users. It grew its total audience to 3.98 billion monthly active users as of the fourth quarter, a 6% increase over 2022.\n\nRevenue was 25% higher year over year, and management paid its first-ever dividend, a sign that the company is confident it can share more profits with investors while investing for long-term growth.\n\nSince Meta came from such a low place in 2022, the stock's remarkable run still hasn't made shares too expensive. It trades at a forward P/E of 23, which is fair for a stellar business that analysts believe will grow earnings at nearly 20% annually over time. Meta Platforms stock looks like a buy-and-hold choice in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMD Stock Outlook: The Data Center Drive That Could Double Your Money",
        "content": "The Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock outlook is pretty solid. Artificial intelligence continually reveals new opportunities for growth and t’s clear there will be more than one pathway to profit and several winners. AMD is going to be one of them.\n\nThe chip maker may play runner-up to industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in AI but its recent fourth-quarter earnings report shined a bright light on how it will succeed and grow. My AMD stock outlook suggests the core of the company’s excellence will be the data center segment. It still has room to expand its position in PCs and gaming, too, but data centers are the immediate profit center.\n\nThe AMD Stock Outlook\n\nFourth-quarter earnings were solid but like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) before it, AMD warned of softness in the PC market for the first quarter. It foresees weak central processing unit demand and expects the gaming business to suffer ongoing contraction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter five strong years, the gaming market is taking a deep breath. That will slow down growth in the immediate future. Experts also predict weakness in embedded chips sales for at least the first half of 2024.\n\nData center revenue, though, is on a tear. Previously, AMD expected sales to be flat moving from Q4 to Q1 with revenue exceeding $2 billion for the full year. Management predicts the segment will rise in Q1 and generate up to $3.5 billion in 2024 and that could be conservative. It might be why AMD stock fell after the earnings release despite the solid gains it reported.\n\nAI is the real driver behind this growth. CEO Lisa Su calls the technology “a once-in-a-generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market.”\n\nThe exciting part is that this is still top-of-the-first-inning stuff. It’s only just getting started and the possibilities appear limitless.\n\nAchieving Record Growth\n\nFourth-quarter data center revenue jumped 38% from last year to $2.3 billion. That was also a 43% increase sequentially. For the full year segment revenue was $6.5 billion and marked a record for the chip maker.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe increases were driven by exceptional growth from AMD’s Instinct GPUs and the fourth-generation EPYC CPUs. Moreover, with its AI-powered MI300X GPU hitting the market, data center GPU revenue far exceeded management guidance of $400 million.\n\nTogether with the significant uptake Advanced Micro Devices also saw in its embedded chip market, the two segments accounted for over half of total revenue for the year.\n\nThe chip maker also gained share in the server market and maintained its industry-leading position as the largest provider of adaptive computing solutions.\n\nIt is well known that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) infused all of its products and services with OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology.\n\nIn particular, its Bing search engine (now called Copilot) and Azure cloud services were standout performers for the tech giant. What is less well-known is it was AMD’s MI300X chip powering AI’s capabilities.\n\nA Finger in Many Pies\n\nThat’s why Advanced Micro Devices will be a long-term leader. It already possesses significant dominance in several markets. Nvidia might have made a name for itself in graphics processing units but AMD’s own expertise in PCs, gaming, and servers positions it to capitalize on them going forward.\n\nAMD makes CPUs for Windows-based computers and holds substantial market share that should persist for some time. Intel’s stumbles in the space give its rival the chance to shore up support.\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), for example, is preparing to pick up the pace of new chip introductions. But AMD won’t experience any appreciable losses. The debut of AI PCs forecast to hit the market in 2024 and then flourish thereafter will drive more business for its Ryzen processors.\n\nThe AMD Stock Outlook: Pay for Quality\n\nAlthough shares carry a premium valuation, Advanced Micro Devices is rapidly expanding to grow into it. Wall Street forecasts the chip maker will grow earnings at 25% a year for the next five years. That is two-and-a-half times greater than AMD stock expanded profits for the last five years.\n\nThere will be an ebb and flow in valuation but buying now and holding on for the long-term will serve any investor’s portfolio well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Potential Stock Splits in 2024: 2 Monster Growth Stocks Up More Than 400% and 1,000% in 4 Years to Buy Now",
        "content": "Share prices of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) soared more than 1,000% and 400%, respectively, over the last four years. Those monster gains make the companies stock-split candidates in 2024, but both are worthwhile investments whether or not those splits happen.\n\nA survey from Morgan Stanley identified artificial intelligence (AI) as the most highly prioritized IT spending category in 2024. Nvidia and CrowdStrike are both positioned to benefit as businesses lean into automation. The survey also identified security software as the third-largest IT spending priority this year. That means endpoint security specialist CrowdStrike actually sits at the intersection of two powerful trends.\n\nHere's why long-term investors should consider buying these two monster growth stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is an accelerated computing company. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to render ultra-realistic visual effects in video games and other multimedia. They are also used to accelerate processing for compute-intensive data center applications like artificial intelligence. Nvidia dominates both markets. Its GPUs account for more than 95% of workstation graphics processors, and 80% to 95% of machine learning chips as measured by sales.\n\nNvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with data center networking equipment and central processing units, both purpose-built for AI. It has also delved into cloud infrastructure and subscription software services with DGX Cloud, a platform that streamlines AI application development across use cases like video analytics, autonomous machines, and intelligent avatars. DGX Cloud also supports the development of generative AI applications.\n\nThe ability to blend hardware, software, and services gives Nvidia an immense competitive advantage.\n\n\"Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud,\" Argus analyst Jim Kelleher recently wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported stunning results in the third quarter. Its revenue jumped 206% to $18.1 billion on record data center sales, and non-GAAP net income increased sixfold to $10 billion due to margin expansion driven by pricing power and a mix shift toward more profitable data center products. Even so, Nvidia has hardly begun to tap what management sees as a $1 trillion addressable market.\n\nGrand View Research forecasts that the GPU market will grow at an annualized rate of 28% through 2030, and the AI market is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 37% during the same period. Nvidia's sales growth should be somewhere between those figures, but its bottom line should grow more quickly as high-margin software and services account for an increasing share of its revenue.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings per share to grow by 81% annually over the next five years. In that context, its present valuation of 95.1 times earnings actually seems reasonable. Of course, the story would change quickly if Nvidia fails to meet those earnings growth expectations, but long-term investors comfortable with that risk should consider opening a small position in this stock today.\n\n2. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCrowdStrike is a cybersecurity software and services vendor. Its portfolio includes more than two dozen applications that cover several large security markets, playing into the growing demand for solutions that support vendor consolidation. Organizations are increasingly eager to reduce the costs and complexity of their cybersecurity systems by unifying the workflows on a single platform. CrowdStrike is ideally situated to benefit from that trend.\n\nIts platform packs superior AI and provides unparalleled threat protection, according to consultancy Frost & Sullivan. Those selling points have helped the company earn a leadership position in several software verticals, including endpoint security, cloud security, and managed detection and response. That gives CrowdStrike access to unique data that improves its AI, creating a network effect that enhances its protection capabilities.\n\nCrowdStrike reported solid financial results in the third quarter, though economic headwinds and pessimism continued to drag on business spending. Revenue increased 35% to $786 million on strong demand for endpoint security solutions, and there was encouraging momentum in cloud security, identity, and security operations products. The company also reported record GAAP net income of $27 million, its third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability.\n\nRapid innovation has kept CrowdStrike on the cutting edge of security software for years, and the company is still steaming along. It recently announced new modules for IT automation, data protection, and exposure management. CrowdStrike also launched a beta version of Charlotte AI, a natural language assistant. Those products widen its addressable market and strengthen its status as a vendor consolidator.\n\nWall Street expects annualized sales growth of 30% over the next five years. Admittedly, the stock still looks pricey at 27.8 times sales, but patient investors comfortable with volatility should also feel comfortable opening a small position today. CrowdStrike is a leader in several cybersecurity markets, and demand for its software and services should trend higher in the years ahead, given the rising costs and prevalence of cybercrime. That should translate into market-beating returns for patient shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The bulk of the gain came from a jump of as much as 9.8% in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the island’s largest stock and the key provider of foundry services for Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe new peaks come as investors continue to pile into the AI theme, driving up shares of chipmakers and other tech firms globally. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index climbed to a new high recently while Nvidia’s market capitalization has soared to around $1.82 trillion, surpassing Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nTSMC’s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nTSMC, which has a weighting of around 30% in the Taiex, reported during the holiday that its January sales rose 7.9% from a year ago. Executives from the company met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month to discuss AI chip supply constraints, a major challenge to the AI boom.\n\n“Taiwan’s been driven by tech, especially the AI theme,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director for Asian equities at abrdn. “Nvidia has been a catalyst adding on to the sentiment, after Jensen Huang visited Taiwan, boosting investors appetite for AI value chain plays and Nvidia suppliers.”\n\nThe lure of further gains in TSMC and other tech stocks has brought an inflow of cash from international investors. Foreign funds have bought nearly $14 billion worth of Taiwanese equities on a net basis since the end of October, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Jeanny Yu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown Adobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into Everything The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

Cherney and Stephen Nellis\n\nFeb 14 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms on Wednesday added Broadcom CEO Hock Tan to its board of directors, bringing on the head of a company known for its networking chips.\n\nBroadcom is one of Meta's key partners in both its data center ambitions and effort to design its own chips and also offers services to help customers design their own chips for artificial intelligence (AI) work.\n\nThe technology to create chips that move and crunch data quickly has become a key battleground as AI systems ingest huge amounts of information.\n\nIn a regulatory filing connected with Tan's appointment to its board, Meta said it spent about $500 million on components and design services from Broadcom in 2023.\n\nWhile Nvidia commands top market share in all-purpose AI chips, all the of the largest technology companies - including Meta, Google, Amazon.com and Microsoft - are also designing specialized custom chips to complement Nvidia's offerings.\n\nReuters reported earlier this month that Nvidia itself is now courting custom chip clients.\n\nTan has used Broadcom as a corporate vehicle to build an empire of loosely related technology companies that analysts say more closely resembles private equity portfolio focused on cash flow rather than a traditional operating company.\n\nBroadcom last year closed a $69 billion deal to purchase VMware and shortly thereafter cut about 1,300 jobs.\n\nMeta on Wednesday also said that John Arnold, a former energy trading executive at Enron now involved in high-voltage transmission line electricity projects, is joining its board of directors.

        "content": "By David Randall\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Several well-known funds jumped into shares of chipmaker Nvidia at the end of last year, securities filings showed on Wednesday, potentially setting themselves up to benefit from the nearly 50% gain the stock has notched so far in 2024.\n\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services, with investor excitement over the new technology sending the stock up 65% last year.\n\nThe chipmaker overtook Alphabet as the third most valuable U.S. company on Wednesday, with a market capitalization of $1.78 trillion.\n\nAmong the funds adding new stakes in Nvidia were Rokos Capital Management, which bought more than 254,000 shares, a stake worth more than $126 million as of the end of December.\n\nBridgewater Associates, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% to more than 268,000 shares. The position was valued at $133 million at the end of December.\n\nArrowstreet Capital, meanwhile, added 3.9 million shares to its previous small position, leaving it with a $2.1 billion position.\n\nSome funds, meanwhile, sold all or part of their stakes.\n\nGreg Poole's Echo Street Capital Management sold all of its more than 355,000 shares. D1 Capital Partners sold nearly 147,000 shares, closing out its position, while Discovery Capital Management sold its about 119,000 shares, which had been 9.2% of its prior portfolio.\n\nThe positions were revealed in securities filings known as 13Fs that hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to gain insight into the portfolios of often-secretive funds.\n\nNvidia will release its quarterly earnings results on Feb. 21. Analysts, on average, see the company's January fiscal quarter revenue more than tripling to $20.37 billion, fueled by demand for its top-shelf AI chips, according to LSEG data.\n\nAnalysts see its adjusted net profit surging more than 400% to $11.38 billion.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of an artificial intelligence spending boom, disclosed investments in Arm Holdings Plc, SoundHound AI Inc. and the biotech company Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Brutal Reality of Plunging Office Values Is Here Dip Buyers Wade Back In to Fuel Wall Street Gains: Markets Wrap Musk Says Putin Can’t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill Israel Pulls Out of Peace Talks Over ‘Delusional’ Hamas Demands Lyft’s CEO Says ‘My Bad’ on Margin Error, ‘It Was One Zero’\n\nNvidia included the information in a 13F form filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, giving a glimpse at the closely watched company’s investment strategy. It has a history with Arm, which Nvidia attempted to acquire for $40 billion in 2020. That deal ultimately crumbled under regulatory pressure, and Nvidia walked away in February 2022.\n\nThe SoundHound investment, meanwhile, was taken as a bullish sign by that company’s investors. Its shares soared as much as 55% in late trading Wednesday after the stake was disclosed. SoundHound makes AI software for audio recognition. Nvidia was cited as a SoundHound investor in 2017.\n\nThe Arm stake was the largest in dollar terms, amounting to $147.3 million. The Recursion holding was valued at $76 million, and the SoundHound stake was $3.67 million. Nvidia also disclosed smaller holdings in medical imaging developer Nano-X Imaging Ltd. and the self-driving company TuSimple Holdings Inc.\n\nFollowing the failed Nvidia takeover, Arm became the biggest initial public offering of 2023. It remains majority-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the chip designer in 2016 for $32 billion. SoftBank has benefited from a dramatic rally in Arm shares this year. The stock is up by more than two-thirds, increasing its market valuation to nearly $130 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown Adobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into Everything The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What Can I Hire My Crush?

        "content": "*\n\nWall St climbs; Nvidia outstrips Alphabet in market value\n\n*\n\nOil slips as U.S. crude build counters upbeat demand forecast\n\n*\n\nUS yields slip after CPI induced surge, Fed comments\n\n(Updates with closing U.S. market levels)\n\nBy Caroline Valetkevitch\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes edged higher while Treasury yields slipped on Wednesday as investors tried to assess the timing of possible interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, while the dollar eased off of a three-month peak against the yen.\n\nJapan's top currency officials warned against what they described as rapid and speculative yen moves overnight.\n\nNvidia shares rose 2.5% and the dominant AI chip maker overtook Alphabet's market capitalization. Nvidia, which reports quarterly results next week, now has a stock market value of $1.825 trillion.\n\nYields briefly extended declines after Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the Fed's path to its 2% inflation target rate would remain on track even if price increases run a bit hotter than expected over the next few months, and the central bank should be wary of waiting too long before cutting interest rates.\n\nMarket expectations for a cut by the Fed in June of at least 25 basis points stand at 78.5%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, while expectations for a cut in May have fallen to 38.5%, down from 63.7% a week ago.\n\nAn upside surprise in U.S. inflation on Tuesday showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.1% on an annual basis, above forecasts for a 2.9% increase.\n\nWith the CPI report, \"it wasn't as if inflation held, it was that it accelerated, and that was what got the market. Suddenly the expectations (on possible rate cuts) pulled back even more,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Every data release is now viewed through the eyes of the Fed. The market wants to know when is the Fed going to feel comfortable about cutting rates and initiating a rate cut regime,\" Krosby said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday brings U.S. retail sales data, while on Friday the U.S. producer price index report will be released.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 151.52 points, or 0.40%, to 38,424.27, the S&P 500 gained 47.45 points, or 0.96%, to 5,000.62 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 203.55 points, or 1.30%, to 15,859.15.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 5.37 points, or 0.73%, to 744.95, while Europe's STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei, which hit its highest in 34 years on Tuesday, fell 0.7%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 5 basis points to 4.267% after touching 4.332% earlier in the session, its highest since Dec. 1.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.13% at 104.72 as investors consolidated gains, while the euro up 0.15% at 1.0725. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.12% at 150.61. The dollar was at a three-month peak against the yen on Tuesday.\n\nThe 150 level on the pair has been seen in the past as a potential catalyst for intervention by Japanese monetary authorities. It was just past this level that they intervened to shore up the yen in late 2022.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 4.16% at $51,626.95.\n\nOil futures declined as higher U.S. crude inventories weighed on prices. U.S. crude lost $1.23 to settle at $76.64 a barrel and Brent fell $1.17 to settle at $81.60.\n\nSpot gold was steady at $1,991.92 per ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Jan Harvey, Nick Zieminski, Jonathan Oatis and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "It’s time to get greedy with down, but not out on metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nAll as the digital world makes a comeback. For example, Disney (NYSE:DIS)—which just announced it will acquire a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games—will work with the gaming company to develop a Metaverse featuring Disney characters that will coexist with Fortnite.\n\nAlso, as noted by Forbes.com, “According to the website METAV.RS, 74% of American adults are considering or have joined the Metaverse. And, by 2026, 25% of individuals are expected to spend an hour per day in the Metaverse.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven artificial intelligence is breathing new life into the metaverse. For example, according to TaylorStrategy.com, “Companies are now starting to explore the potential of how AI can play a role in creating more immersive and engaging virtual experiences in the metaverse.”\n\nAlso, despite the metaverse’s rollercoaster history, it could be worth billions. In fact, according to Grand View Research, it could be worth about $936 billion by 2030. That being said, investors may want to jump on the hottest metaverse stocks to buy. These include the following.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince late September, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) exploded from a low of $26 to a recent high of $47.11. Even now, it’s still one of the top metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nAll thanks to growing demand, the metaverse comeback, and strong earnings. It may have lost 52 cents in the fourth quarter, but that was better than expectations. Bookings were up 25.3% year over year to $1.13 billion. Average daily active users jumped 22% year over year to 71.5 million. Monthly unique visitor numbers rose 18% to 15.9 million.\n\nRBLX expects for first quarter bookings to come in between $910 million and $940 million, which is above expectations of $902.6 million. For the full year, bookings are expected to come in between $4.14 billion and $4.28 billion, which is above estimates for $4.06 billion. Plus, the company expects for its top line to grow by about 20% every year through 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, Barclays upgraded Roblox to Equal Weight, noting that, “RBLX’s execution has become much steadier since mid-2023. The longer-term framework of 20% bookings CAGR and 20% DITBA margin, with advertising entering the fray at some point, looks attractive.”\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Unity Software (NYSE:U), an oversold $12.5 billion software company.\n\nHelping, analysts at Bank of America just reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock, believing its well positioned for faster growth. In fact, as noted by Seeking Alpha, “The bank has faith that Unity will emerge better positioned to compete in a stabilizing mobile game market with improved profitability and strategic focus.”\n\nEven better, the company is undergoing strategic changes to right the ship. That includes a new CEO and a recently announced 25% staff reduction. We also have to remember that Unity is working with Apple on immersive 3D apps for the tech giant’s Apple Vision Pro.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify, there’s always an exchange-traded ETF like the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), which just ran from about $9 to a high of $12.50. From here, as the Metaverse perks back up, I’d like to see the METV closer to $20 this year.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF offers exposure to 47 metaverse-related stocks, including Roblox, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This makes it an incredibly attractive Metaverse stock, and on you should grab for your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

With the gain, the chipmaker has become the world’s fourth-most valuable company. Saudi Aramco, valued at about $2 trillion, looms as the next milestone.\n\nNvidia’s rally has been relentless this year. The stock has climbed about 49% and added some $602 billion in value, boosted by an insatiable demand for its accelerators that power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications.\n\nWhile other big tech shares have hardly performed badly in 2024, juxtaposed with Nvidia’s rally they appear to be relegated to the slow lane. The other mega-cap tech firms have already announced earnings, and Nvidia is slated to report Feb. 21.\n\n“Expecting another strong report, but the bar has been raised,” Susquehanna Investment Group analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note Wednesday.\n\nWall Street analysts are seeing signs of continued robust demand for Nvidia’s AI H100 accelerators. The chipmaker’s sales have been driven by AI spending at its biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nAt least five brokers have hiked price targets for Nvidia this month. Analysts on average have boosted 2024 revenue estimates by more than 100% over the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWhile the AI frenzy has boosted tech stocks that have been linked to the technology, Nvidia is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown Adobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into Everything The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What Can I Hire My Crush?

        "content": "*\n\nWall St climbs; Nvidia outstrips Alphabet in market value\n\n*\n\nOil slips as U.S. crude build counters upbeat demand forecast\n\n*\n\nUS yields slip after CPI induced surge, Fed comments\n\n(Updates to 2:45 p.m. ET, adds comment)\n\nBy Caroline Valetkevitch\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes edged higher while Treasury yields slipped on Wednesday as investors tried to assess the timing of possible interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, while the dollar eased off of a three-month peak against the yen.\n\nJapan's top currency officials warned on Wednesday against what they described as rapid and speculative yen moves overnight.\n\nNvidia, whose shares were last up 1.4% and were helping to support the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, topped Alphabet's market value to become the third-most valuable U.S. company.\n\nYields briefly extended declines after Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the Fed's path back to its 2% inflation target rate would still be on track even if price increases run a bit hotter than expected over the next few months, and the central bank should be wary of waiting too long before it cuts interest rates.\n\nMarket expectations for a cut by the Fed in June of at least 25 basis points stand at 78.5%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, while expectations for a cut in May have fallen to 38.5%, down from 63.7% a week ago.\n\nThe latest shift in rate expectations came after an upside surprise in U.S. inflation on Tuesday that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.1% on an annual basis, above forecasts for a 2.9% increase.\n\nWith the CPI report, \"it wasn't as if inflation held, it was that it accelerated, and that was what got the market. Suddenly the expectations (on possible rate cuts) pulled back even more,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Every data release is now viewed through the eyes of the Fed. The market wants to know when is the Fed going to feel comfortable about cutting rates and initiating a rate cut regime,\" Krosby said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday brings U.S. retail sales data, while on Friday the U.S. producer price index report will be released.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.43 points, or 0.10%, to 38,310.18; the S&P 500 gained 26.72 points, or 0.54%, to 4,979.89; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 125.21 points, or 0.80%, to 15,780.81.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 3.47 points, or 0.47%, to 743.05, while Europe's STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei, which hit its highest in 34 years on Tuesday, fell 0.7%.\n\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 5.1 basis points to 4.265%, from 4.316% late on Tuesday. Yields had surged on Tuesday following the CPI data.\n\nThe dollar index fell 0.13% to 104.72, with the euro up 0.15% at 1.0725. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.16% to 150.55. The dollar was at a three-month peak against the yen on Tuesday.\n\nThe 150 level on the pair has been seen in the past as a potential catalyst for intervention by Japanese monetary authorities. It was just past this level that they intervened to shore up the yen in late 2022.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin gained 4.20% to $51,659.22.\n\nOil futures declined as higher U.S. crude inventories weighed on prices. U.S. crude lost $1.23 to settle at $76.64 a barrel and Brent fell $1.17 to settle at $81.60.\n\nSpot gold was steady at $1,991.92 per ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Jan Harvey, Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)",

The position was valued at $133 million at the end of December.\n\nNvidia, whose shares have already risen 47% this year, briefly overtook Google-parent Alphabet's stock market capitalization to become the third-biggest U.S. company on Wednesday, with a market capitalization of over $1.8 trillion.\n\nBridgewater also bought roughly 500,000 new shares in Alphabet, bringing its total to 2 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter, valued at $286 million. The hedge fund also added a few more shares in Meta, bringing its position to 666,059 shares, while it acquired a comparatively small new position in Apple, of 1,109 shares, and roughly maintained its exposure to Microsoft at 197,732 shares.\n\nThe positions were revealed in securities filings known as 13-fs, which hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to see the portfolios of often-secretive funds.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 4% this year, while Meta’s have risen 33%. Tesla and Apple are down this year 24.6% and 5%, respectively.\n\nBridgewater also bought more shares in Eli Lilly, which is one of the makers of the popular new weight-loss drugs. Its shares are up 29% this year. Bridgewater added 255,619 new shares of Eli Lilly in the last quarter of 2023 and now holds 317,586 shares.\n\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",

        "content": "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that is red hot right now. Machine learning is a technology that enables computers to emulate how humans learn and adapt by combining data and experience. It began in earnest back in the 1950s, led by IBM (NYSE:IBM), whose scientists coined the term. Today, machine learning is training AI models and applications, teaching them how to collect, collate and communicate information back to us humans. Given the massive potential of AI, machine learning has become a fast-growing segment of technology.\n\nFortune Business Insights forecasted the global market for machine learning will grow from $26.03 billion in 2023 to $225.91 billion by 2030 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. As the market takes off, let’s look at how to get rich quickly with these three machine learning stocks to buy now.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) uses machine learning to power its software that specializes in workflow management. The company essentially uses machine learning to help its customers eliminate mundane tasks, helping to improve workplace productivity in the process. The company has been reporting strong growth in recent quarters due to growing demand for its machine learning products and also its new AI offerings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServiceNow has developed 15 new generative AI tools over the last year and is achieving up to 40% productivity gains as a result. The company said its recent fourth-quarter 2023 earnings were given a boost by the rollout of new AI software that works in combination with machine learning. ServiceNow primarily makes money from subscription revenues and sees those rising substantially this year. NOW stock is up 68% over the last 12 months, including an 11% gain year-to-date.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla cars\n\nTesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) self-driving car features rely entirely on machine learning. While self-driving vehicles are controversial and potentially dangerous, they’re likely the future of the automotive industry. Emulating the many split-second decisions that a human driver makes is complex and requires the most advanced machine learning available. Tesla is a true pioneer in this area, and the company’s “Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” features are leaders when it comes to self-driving vehicle technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is currently developing a new supercomputer called Dojo. The company claims it will use machine learning to train AI models and further develop and enhance its self-driving vehicle technologies. Tesla announced plans to spend more than $1 billion on the continued development of this new supercomputer. Company CEO Elon Musk also continues to talk up the importance of AI and the need for Tesla to expand its footprint in the space. TSLA stock is up nearly 800% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) microchips and semiconductors are powering the machine learning and AI revolution that’s now underway. The supercomputers that run machine learning and train AI models require massive amounts of information and circuitry, and Nvidia’s high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) perform the task better than any other company. Nvidia’s most advanced GPUs power data centers and are being used to train AI models all over the world.\n\nNvidia’s microchips and semiconductors are being used by a diverse range of customers, including mega-cap technology companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and automakers like Tesla. Not only that but biotech companies developing disease cures and shipping companies trying to maximize their supply chains are too. Nvidia’s next earnings print is scheduled for Feb. 21 and promises to be another blockbuster. NVDA has risen 234% over the last 12 months, including a nearly 50% increase so far this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "content": "Blue chip stocks are what many investors look for when trying to add new stocks to their portfolios. What really are these companies? Well, a blue chip company is generally a well-known and well-established company that has a history of generating consistent profits. They have grown their revenue in the past and have worked to make a successful company. That’s why these are usually more reliable to invest in since they are not small startup companies that just hit the market and carry tons of risk.\n\nInvestors really know what they are getting into when investing in these companies. However, many times these companies are overlooked as “obvious choices.” They might even seem like boring stocks to invest in when we see AI stocks and the like flying up. But blue chip stocks can still have plenty of potential. That’s why, in this article, we have done the research and aim to present you with three blue-chip stocks that you shouldn’t ignore.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a massive technology company with a goal to enable people across the world to work, play, and communicate. Microsoft has exceeded its expected earnings for every quarter of 2023. Analysts estimate that this stock will trade within a one-year range of $298.10-$546.44, with an average of $455.86. Copilot will benefit Microsoft because it increases consumer demand for Microsoft’s products and could potentially enable Microsoft to increase its own productivity and efficiency.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLast year, Microsoft released Copilot, a program that increases consumers’ productivity. Copilot increases creativity through feedback and trends and improves productivity through emptying inboxes and automating tasks.

Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the most talked about companies this year with unparalleled innovation in the field. The company has enabled countless breakthroughs with its advanced AI chip technology and expertise with GPUs. The future of the company is highly debated though, with Yahoo Finance analysts predicting a price range of $410 to $1100, with an average of $670.\r\n\r\nThe AI market has been rapidly expanding for the past year, with a near 100% growth. This is only going to get larger with Bloomberg Intelligence claiming that the industry could grow at a CAGR of 42% over the next ten years. The good news is that currently, NVIDIA has a staggering 92% market share, a drastic advantage that it will hold on to well into the real AI revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to financials, NVIDIA to say NVIDIA has excelled is an understatement. When it comes to revenue, it has had a 205% increase in the last year alone. This shows that NVIDIA has no signs of slowing down and these numbers are only going to increase as AI becomes more advanced and more prevalent in our daily lives.\n\nAmerican Express(AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is one of the world’s biggest financial corporations, mainly known for its credit card offerings. Yahoo Finance analysts currently estimate the stock price to be between $125 and $240, with an average of $205 for the following year. American Express seems to have a decent hold on the credit card market.\n\nDespite increasing inflation and interest rates, consumer spending didn’t seem to have any signs of slowing down last year. This rise particularly benefitted American Express, especially when it comes to revenue and profit. The company’s revenue has increased by 15% in the last year alone. The gross profit followed the same trend with an 11% year-over-year increase. The company’s P/E of 18.69x makes it a relative bargain to its peers in the banking industry, who average a 25.5x P/E. All of these positive attributes make American Exoress a blue-chip stock for every investor to consider buying.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It has been trying to reposition itself as a software supplier for electric vehicles, developing autonomous driving systems, while closing some factories producing parts for petrol and diesel vehicles.\n\nIt said it would shed 1,750 jobs in research and development. This, it said, would help it “increase efficiency” by reducing the number of locations where it develops products, from the existing 82, and allow it to focus on “promising growth areas”.\n\nMeanwhile, it will also lose around 5,400 posts as part of a previously announced cost-cutting programme aimed at saving the group €400m (£341m) by 2025.\n\nHowever, a company spokesman said there would be “only very minor impact” in the UK.\n\nContinental, which currently employs around 200,000 people worldwide, announced the plan in November without putting a precise figure on the number of jobs that would go.\n\nContinental’s automotive chief Philipp von Hirschheydt said: “We are aware of the impact on our employees and will do everything we can to find good, tailored solutions (for employees).”\n\nHe said the cuts would allow Continental to “focus our resources even more on future technologies for software-defined vehicles”.\n\nGermany’s car industry has been facing problems as the transition to electric vehicles gathers pace, after decades relying on fossil fuel vehicles for their profits.\n\nContinental and rivals Robert Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen are bracing for muted car production this year amid a slowdown in electric-vehicle demand.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

An increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products also helped boost the company’s bottom line.\n\nLike other Japanese companies, Sony has benefited from recent exchange rate trends. The yen has weakened against the dollar, boosting the value of overseas earnings when they are converted into yen.\n\nSales of recorded and published music, merchandise and licensing revenue rose, Sony said.\n\nIn Sony’s pictures operations, TV and digital streaming licensing revenue and home entertainment sales climbed during the fiscal year following successful movie releases.\n\nHits included Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, an animation film about the superhero, and The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was a hit for Sony - Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\n03:34 PM GMT\n\nAI technology being used for offensive cyber attacks, warns Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has said today that adversaries of America and members of the international community - chiefly Iran and North Korea and to a lesser extent Russia and China - are beginning to use so-called generative artificial intelligence techniques to mount or organise offensive cyber operations.\n\nThe technology giant said it detected and disrupted, in collaboration with business partner OpenAI, threats that used or attempted to exploit AI technology they had developed.\n\nThe software giant said the techniques were “early-stage” and neither “particularly novel or unique” but that it was important to expose them publicly as US rivals leverage large-language models to expand their ability to breach networks and conduct influence operations.\n\nCybersecurity firms have long used machine-learning on defence, principally to detect anomalous behaviour in networks. But criminals and offensive hackers use it as well, and the introduction of large-language models led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT upped that game of cat-and-mouse.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, and today’s announcement coincided with its release of a report noting that generative AI is expected to enhance malicious social engineering, leading to more sophisticated deepfakes and voice cloning. This could pose a threat to democracy in a year where over 50 countries will conduct elections, magnifying disinformation and already occurring,\n\nLast April, the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, told Congress that “there are two epoch-defining threats and challenges. One is China, and the other is artificial intelligence.”\n\n03:30 PM GMT\n\nUK recession 'frankly in the balance,' says Bailey\n\nAndrew Bailey has told peers that it is “in the balance” as to whether Britain has fallen into a technical recession or not.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics publishes its latest figures for gross domestic product (GDP) tomorrow, which will show Britain fell into a recession it the economy shrank in the final three months of 2023.\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee:\n\nLast year, overall GDP was basically flat. We will find out whether we had a so-called technical recession or not depending on what the fourth quarter number is.\n\nIn our February Monetary Policy Report it was frankly in the balance. We didn’t have a recession in the forecast but it is at best flat. It wouldn’t take much to tip it either way frankly.\n\nI would say, underneath that, and it’s quite an important point to make, that if you split that overall GDP number into what we call the market economy and the government economy, actually the market economy was negative and the government economy was positive.\n\nThe big GDP revisions we had were all on the government economy - things like health and education.\n\nNow, going forwards, however, I think we are now seeing some signs of the beginning of a pick-up in some of the surveys, for instance. Certainly in our view in the February report we published two weeks ago, we have got a modest pickup this year which continues thereafter.\n\nWith that I will say goodbye for the day and hand you over to my colleague Alex Singleton.\n\n03:15 PM GMT\n\nBailey hails 'broad-based' falls in inflation\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England said the latest inflation figures were “encouraging” because of the “broad based” nature of the slow down in price rises.\n\nAndrew Bailey was speaking to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee after inflation remained steady at 4pc, below economists’ expectations of an increase to 4.1pc.\n\nHe said:\n\nIf you look under the surface there is a bit more to it than that, which is the encouraging bit.\n\nThe reason we were expecting a small tick up in inflation this month was because of these so-called annual base effects...\n\nThey were there, so nothing’s changed on those, they were in the arithmetic. What it means is there were some more other things going on which were putting more downward pressure on it [inflation] than we expected so that’s good news.\n\nAs far as I can tell, looking at it this morning, that amount of downward movement was pretty broad based - a bit of it in energy, some in food but also some of in services as well, so that’s quite encouraging.\n\nIt leaves us broadly where we thought we were going to be but that’s obviously encouraging compared to where we could have been.\n\n03:02 PM GMT\n\nKraft Heinz sales slide as customers switch to cheaper brands\n\nBaked beans and ketchup maker Kraft Heinz suffered a slip in sales during the fourth quarter as customers switched to cheaper brands.\n\nKraft Heinz had increased prices by 3.7pc as it sought to preserve profits as a result of inflation but as a result volumes fell by 4.4pc.\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $757m (£603m).\n\nThe processed food company with dual headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago posted revenue of $6.86bn, which fell shy of the $6.97bn forecast by analysts.\n\nFor the year, the company reported profit of $2.9bn, or $2.31 per share.

We have been in the camp of later and lesser from central banks.\n\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had gained 0.5pc and the Nasdaq 100 had risen 0.6pc.\n\n12:23 PM GMT\n\nJeff Bezos boosts fortune by selling $4bn in Amazon shares\n\nJeff Bezos has sold more than $4bn (£3.2bn) worth of Amazon stock, as the tech tycoon looks to cash in on some of his vast holdings.\n\nOur senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:\n\nThe Amazon founder bolstered his $190bn fortune in recent days by selling shares in two tranches worth $2bn apiece, which comes after his company’s share price neared an all-time high.\n\nAmazon’s shares have risen more than 12pc so far this year after the company reported a 14pc rise in Christmas sales last week.

US-produced West Texas Intermediate has fallen 0.2pc to less than $78.\n\nIt comes as the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported US crude stockpiles rose by 8.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nMeanwhile, Opec’s top official said on Tuesday that global oil demand is poised to expand strongly.\n\nHowever, a monthly outlook from the group revealed limited compliance with the members’ latest round of supply cuts.\n\nSeparately, the Paris-based International Energy Agency flagged comfortable markets this year, with expected supply growth more than satisfying worldwide consumption.\n\n11:40 AM GMT\n\nPay offer 'dead in the water,' says rail union boss\n\nAfter announcing the approval of more strike action, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said:\n\nThese results show – yet again – a clear rejection by train drivers of the ridiculous offer put to us in April last year by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of the train operating companies with whom we are in dispute.\n\nThe RDG knew the offer would be rejected because we had told them that a land grab for all the terms & conditions we have negotiated over the years would be unacceptable.\n\nSince then our members have voted, time and again, for strikes. That’s why Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, is being disingenuous when he says that offer should have been put to members. Drivers obviously wouldn’t vote for industrial action, again and again and again, if they thought that was a good offer. They don’t. That offer was dead in the water in April last year – and I think Mr Harper knows that.\n\nBut we remain open and willing, as ever, to talk about a revised offer. That’s why we are asking the Secretary of State for Transport, or the Rail Minister Huw Merriman, to come and meet us. Mr Harper hasn’t seen fit to talk to us since December 2022; Mr Merriman has not been in the room with us since January 2023; and the RDG has not talked to us since April last year.\n\nToday we are saying, clearly, to Mr Harper, Mr Merriman, the RDG and the TOCs, come and talk to us. Let’s sit around the table and negotiate. You don’t want any more strikes, and we do not want to be forced to take any more industrial action, although we have the renewed mandates to do just that.\n\nWe want to find a resolution to this dispute, for members who have not had a pay rise since our last deals ran out in 2019, and the only way to resolve this dispute is for the employers, and the government that stands behind them, to come and talk to us.\n\nThat’s why I’m saying the ball is in your court.

He said:\n\nThe headline rate remains on track to fall to the 2pc target in April, when the Ofgem cap on energy bills will be lowered sharply, and it may well drop further later in the year. Recession and deflation could soon be the bigger threats.\n\nThe headline rate was held down by a further fall in food price inflation and weakness in ‘furniture and household goods’ and ‘clothing and footwear’, suggesting that December’s slump in retail sales has prompted some heavier discounting. This is market forces at work.\n\nUnderlying all this, money and credit growth is subdued, which should continue to dampen inflation in the months ahead.\n\nInterest rates are probably on hold until May, but when the Bank of England does move it is likely to move quickly, with rates ending the year at around 4pc.\n\n09:14 AM GMT\n\nBP agrees tie-up with Abu Dhabi oil giant in Egypt\n\nBP and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co - known as Adnoc - have agreed to form a joint venture in Egypt that will focus on natural gas.\n\nLondon-listed oil giant BP will contribute its interests in three development concessions to the new tie-up, as well as exploration agreements in Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, state-owned Adnoc will make a proportionate cash contribution which can be used for future growth opportunities.\n\nThe deal gives Abu Dhabi a foothold in Egypt, which supplies liquefied natural gas to Europe.\n\nBP and Italy’s Eni SpA have been working in the country for decades to develop fields and increase oil and gas production.

Heineken warned that inflation would weigh on beer demand - Peter Boer/Bloomberg\n\n08:43 AM GMT\n\nFTSE 100 higher after inflation surprise\n\nUK shares opened higher as markets drew comfort from the lower-than-expected inflation last month, fuelling hopes for an early interest rate cut from the Bank of England.\n\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.4pc, while the midcap FTSE 250 added 0.4pc after falling nearly 1.5pc on Tuesday.\n\nData showed that CPI unexpectedly held steady at an annual rate of 4pc in January, unchanged from December, providing a boost for the Bank of England. Economists had anticipated an increase to 4.1pc.\n\nThe pound has weakened against the dollar as a result and was last down 0.4pc, strengthening stocks on the exporter-heavy FTSE 100.\n\nInterest rate cut expectations increased after the data, with money markets expecting around 70 basis points of interest rate cuts this year, up from about 58 basis points previously.\n\nInterest-rate sensitive housebuilders were among the top performers, rising as much as 2pc.\n\nAmong corporate updates, Coca-Cola HBC jumped 5pc to lead the FTSE 100 after the bottler said it expects profit to grow in 2024 and reported upbeat annual profit.\n\n08:30 AM GMT\n\nDunelm warns of hit from Red Sea disruption\n\nHomewares retailer Dunelm has shrugged off “more difficult” trading conditions to notch up higher half-year profits - but warned margins could be affected by the shipping crisis in the Red Sea.\n\nThe chain posted a 4.8pc rise in pre-tax profits to £123m for the six months to December 30 after sales lifted 4.5pc.\n\nThis came despite a sharp slowdown in sales growth to 1pc in the final three months of 2023 compared with a year earlier, when sales had surged by 17.6pc.\n\nDunelm said it is “pleased” with trading in 2024 so far thanks to a resilient customer base, but warned that the consumer outlook remains “uncertain”.\n\nLeicester-headquartered Dunelm said recent improvements in profit margins will slow over its second half as it flagged that shipping costs are rising again, as well as a drag from currency movements.\n\nThe group said: “We are managing the impact of ships taking longer, more costly routes as they avoid the Red Sea area.”\n\nIt added: “We have a tight grip on operating costs and were therefore able to partially offset some of the inflationary increases and investment through productivity and efficiency initiatives.” Dunelm\n\n08:12 AM GMT\n\nInterest rate cut in second quarter 'kept alive' by inflation figures\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest inflation figures have “kept alive” hopes of an interest rate cut in the second quarter of the year:\n\nJanuary's UK CPI figures keep alive chances that the MPC will cut Bank Rate in Q2. \r\n\r\nI calculate that three-month-on-three-month annualised growth in the Committee's preferred underlying services CPI slowed to 3.7%—its lowest rate since February 2022—from 4.7% in December: pic.twitter.com/b9YZCcR1uY\n\n— Samuel Tombs (@samueltombs) February 14, 2024\n\n08:06 AM GMT\n\nUK markets open higher after inflation surprise\n\nStock markets in London have opened higher after inflation unexpectedly held steady at 4pc in January, after economists had predicted an increase.\n\nThe FTSE 100 has begun the day up 0.6pc to 7,554.83 while the FTSE 250 has risen 0.4pc to 18,990.74.\n\n07:58 AM GMT\n\nNo space for complacency on inflation, warn retailers\n\nRetailers warned that the impending increase in the minimum wage is a threat to inflation as they warned there is “no space for complacency” as inflation held firm.\n\nKris Hamer, director of insight of the British Retail Consortium, said:\n\nDiscounts offered by retailers in the January sales helped shoppers, particularly in clothing and footwear.\n\nThere was some good news for households, as food inflation fell for the tenth consecutive month, with condiments and dried vegetables seeing large month-on-month falls in price.\n\nWith the headline inflation rate failing to fall for the second consecutive month there is no space for complacency.\n\nGovernment should recognise the cumulative impact of their policies – from rises in business rates to its new packaging levy – at a time when minimum wages are seeing the biggest rise on record and border checks are being implemented.\n\nUltimately, if these costs continue rising unabated, it is inevitable that they will filter back into the price paid by households.\n\n07:50 AM GMT\n\nPound falls after inflation lower than forecast\n\nThe pound has dropped after inflation unexpectedly held steady in a sign that markets believe the data boosts the chances of interest rate cuts.\n\nSterling has fallen 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.25 and was down 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 85p.\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said:\n\nInflation in the UK economy is clearly easing much more quickly than expected and the surge in prices of the pandemic and energy crisis will soon be a bad memory.\n\nIndeed, we still expect inflation to fall below 2pc as early as April, which would throw the door wide open to an interest rate cut in the spring or early summer.\n\nLooking ahead, base effects mean that the inflation rate is likely to be bumpy for the first three months of this year before falling to below 2pc as early as April. That will provide excellent cover for the MPC to pivot and start cutting interest rates.\n\n07:45 AM GMT\n\nInflation surprise ‘keeps alive’ hopes of spring interest rate cut\n\nInflation is easing more quickly than expected, economists have said, as the pace of price rises held steady last month in a surprise boost for the Prime Minister.\n\nRishi Sunak was given a Valentine’s Day gift as the consumer prices index remained unchanged at 4pc in January, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nEconomists had expected prices to rise by 4.1pc compared to the same month last year but many have said the latest data opens the door to earlier interest rate cuts from the Bank of England.\n\nA fall in interest rates, which currently stand at 5.25pc, would ease restrictions on household spending, delivering a boost for the economy.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures “keep alive chances” that the Bank of England will cut interest rates in the second quarter of this year, while Simon French of Panmure Gordon said inflation had continued its “softening trend”.\n\nResolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell said he does not “buy the market consensus that data this week points to later rate cuts”.\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said: “Inflation in the UK economy is clearly easing much more quickly than expected and the surge in prices of the pandemic and energy crisis will soon be a bad memory.\n\n“Indeed, we still expect inflation to fall below 2pc as early as April, which would throw the door wide open to an interest rate cut in the spring or early summer.”\n\nMoney markets increased bets on interest rate cuts after the inflation data, pricing in around 70 basis points of reductions - equivalent to just under three quarter of a point cuts - up from about 58 basis points previously.\n\nI don’t really buy the market consensus that data this week points to later rate cuts.

Prices are still rising in the shops, with the average household’s costs up £110-a-week compared to before the last election.\n\nInflation is still higher than the Bank of England’s target and millions of families are struggling with the cost of living.\n\nThe Conservatives cannot fix the economy because they are the reason it is broken. It’s time for change.\n\nOnly Labour has a long-term plan to get Britain’s future back by delivering more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nUnderlying inflation lower than expected\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 5.1pc in January, which was the same rate as in November and December and lower than economists forecasts of a rise to 5.2pc.\n\nThe figure, which is closely-watched by the Bank of England, has fallen from 7.1pc in May, which was the highest recorded since March 1992.\n\nPolicymakers have also pointed to the importance of services inflation, which they fear could keep inflation persistent and force them to keep interest rates higher.\n\nHowever, this performed better than expected, rising fractionally from 6.4pc in December to 6.5pc in January. Economists had forecast for the figure to jump to 6.8pc.\n\n07:21 AM GMT\n\nWe need to start seeing inflation fall, say estate agents\n\nInflation now needs to begin to fall to bring confidence back to the property market, according to an industry body.\n\nNathan Emerson, chief executive of Propertymark, which represents estate agents, said:\n\nThere is a silver lining in the fact that inflation has stayed the same as we are unlikely to see any increases to borrowing and further strains on the purses of the nation.\n\nThat being said, the Bank of England made an optimistic projection in February that the rate of inflation would be back down to 2pc, like it was prior to the pandemic, and whilst the figure remains at 4pv, this will be sure to make them cautious about cutting rates.\n\nWe now need to start seeing inflation fall so that interest rates can drop too, as this will result in more people being able to move home or step onto the housing ladder.\n\n07:18 AM GMT\n\nHunt: We have made huge progress on inflation\n\nAs inflation held steady at 4pc, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:\n\nInflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11pc, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2pc in a matter of months.\n\n07:17 AM GMT\n\nMonthly food prices fall for first time in year two years\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said monthly prices for food and non-alcoholic beverage fell by 0.4pc between December and January, compared with a rise of 0.6pc a year ago.\n\nMonthly prices for food (excluding non-alcoholic beverages) also fell by 0.4pc.\n\nThis was the first fall in monthly prices since September 2021, and the largest fall since July 2021.\n\n07:14 AM GMT\n\nFood prices fall for first time in two years\n\nAs inflation remained steady at 4pc, ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said:\n\nInflation was unchanged in January reflecting counteracting effects within the basket of goods and services.\n\nThe price of gas and electricity rose at a higher rate than this time last year due to the increase in the energy price cap, while the cost of second-hand cars went up for the first time since May.\n\nOffsetting these, prices of furniture and household goods decreased by more than a year ago and food prices fell on the month for the first time in over two years.\n\nAll of these factors combined resulted in no change to the headline rate this month.\n\n07:07 AM GMT\n\nInflation holds steady in unexpected boost for Sunak\n\nRishi Sunak has been given a Valentine’s Day gift as inflation unexpectedly held steady last month.\n\nThe consumer prices index (CPI) - which measures the costs that households face - was unchanged at 4pc in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nEconomists had expected prices to rise by 4.1pc compared to the same month last year.\n\nThe drop eases pressure on the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer to bring inflation back down to its 2pc target.\n\nA fall in interest rates, which currently stand at 5.25pc, would ease restrictions on household spending, delivering a boost for the economy.\n\nIt would also lower government borrowing costs, providing the Chancellor with more headroom for spending in an election year.\n\nEconomists are already predicting that inflation will fall to 3.4pc in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, figures from the US showed that inflation slowed to 3.1pc from 3.4pc earlier, but the slowdown was less than the drop to 2.9pc that had been expected.\n\nIn the year to January 2024:\r\n\r\n&squf;️ Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) rose by 4.2%, the same rate as December.\r\n\r\n&squf;️ Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 4.0%, unchanged from 4.0% in December.\r\n\r\n➡️ https://t.co/OgNFNwsta0pic.twitter.com/MWx8Sz8iCo\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 14, 2024\n\n07:03 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4pc, to 4,953.17. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading American companies fell 1.4pc, to 38,272.75. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8pc, to 15,655.60.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury bonds rose to 4.3123pc compared with 4.17pc on Monday.\n\nAsian equities sank Wednesday, tracking a sell-off on Wall Street, as a forecast-topping US inflation report dealt a hefty blow to hopes for an early interest rate cut.\n\nThe dimming prospects of a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve also sent the dollar surging against the yen, forcing Japanese officials to warn they would intervene in forex markets to support the country’s currency.\n\nExpectations for a rate cut have been doused in recent weeks by a series of strong indicators - particularly on the economy and jobs - while several monetary policymakers warned they want to see more data before shifting.\n\nAsian traders ran for cover, with Hong Kong in retreat as it reopened after an extended break for the Lunar New Year, while Tokyo, Sydney, Singapore, Seoul, Wellington and Manila were also well down.\n\nThe dollar held on to most of its gains against its peers, with its movements against the yen of particular interest to investors after it jumped around one percent to sit back above 150 for the first time since November.\n\nHowever, officials in Tokyo said they were keeping a close eye on developments and were ready to step in to support their currency.",

Nvidia's shares were up 0.7% while the Google-parent lost 0.2%.\n\n\"If AI is truly going to be a game changer for the world, Nvidia is at the forefront of all of that,\" said Dennis Dick, founder and market structure analyst at Triple D Trading.\n\nRate-sensitive megacap Meta Platforms and other chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm gained between 1.8% and 2.5%.\n\nThe indexes had slumped to over one-week lows on Tuesday and the blue-chip Dow posted its worst day in 11 months, as core consumer prices in January stayed at nearly double the Fed's 2% target, forcing investors to reassess their rate cut expectations.\n\nProviding some relief were Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee's comments that the path back to 2% inflation target would still be on track even if price increases run a bit hotter-than-expected going ahead, and the central bank should be wary of waiting too long before cutting rates.\n\n\"I think the inflation trend is still very friendly to this market and a lot of people who are still under-invested in this market are using the dip to get in,\" Dick added.\n\nEuphoria around an early start to monetary policy easing had fueled a Wall Street rally since November, paving the way for a bull market for the S&P 500 this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, policymakers might have to wait a bit longer for more evidence of easing price pressures in the face of a resilient U.S. economy.\n\nBets for an at least 25-basis-point rate reduction in May stood at 35%, down from 63% earlier in the week, while expectations for June stood at 81%, the CME FedWatch tool showed.\n\nAt 11:34 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54.02 points, or 0.14%, at 38,326.77, the S&P 500 was up 21.70 points, or 0.44%, at 4,974.87, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 89.70 points, or 0.57%, at 15,745.30.\n\nUber gained 11.7% to notch a record high, boosted by a $7 billion share buyback plan, steering a 1% advance in the industrial sector that led sectoral gains. The small-caps Russell 2000 index also added 1.2%.\n\nLyft surged 32.9% after the ride-hailing platform's profit beat estimates and it said it would generate positive free cash flow for the first time in 2024.\n\nRobinhood Markets jumped 9.4% following a surprise fourth-quarter profit.\n\nCrypto stocks like Coinbase, Marathon Digital and Riot surged between 10.8% and 12.4% as bitcoin's market value crossed $1 trillion for the first time since Nov. 21.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.01-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 26 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 57 new highs and 51 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju Samuel)",

        "title": "The 3 Best AI Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "Despite the significant progress made in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade, we are still on the cusp of a profound transformation. AI integration will occur across all sectors of society and industry. This article discusses the best AI stocks to buy for this revolution.\n\nAs data generation grows, AI’s applications and capabilities are expanding. Today, data is growing exponentially and organizations need ways to extract value from this data. This data deluge can be overwhelming with the proliferation of internet-connected devices, social media and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, AI applications can learn from this data, improving decision-making and the customer experience.\n\nIndeed, artificial intelligence has become a competitive advantage. According to the Boston Consulting Group, 85% of C-suite executives plan to increase their investments in AI and GenAI this year. This means businesses must adopt the technology; otherwise, they risk losing to the competition.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnticipating the surge in AI spending, markets have rewarded the best AI stocks to buy. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are dragging the markets higher. Despite their impressive runs, they are still candidates for investment. Let’s explore these top AI companies in greater detail.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter the recent earnings report, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) stunned market participants, gaining over 50%. Investors were impressed by the several growth tailwinds highlighted by management.\n\nFirst, on the earnings call, management highlighted the revenue growth potential as customers migrate from its Armv8 to Armv9 product. According to management, the latter brings in twice the royalty amount. Thus, Arm will earn higher loyalty revenues as customers migrate to the new platform.\n\nSecondly, the company is enjoying AI tailwinds from data-center GPUs and more AI devices. Recently launched edge devices with AI capabilities, like Samsung Galaxy S24 or Google’s Gemini Nano Pixel 6, have boosted revenues. Additionally, on the data center front, training GPUs like the Grace Hopper 200 are running on Arm’s architecture. As AI devices grow, there will be a licensing growth tailwind.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third growth driver is the Compute Subsystems segment. Arm has been designing completed blocks of chip designs and offering them to customers. The first design, Microsoft Cobalt, has enjoyed tremendous success due to the short validation and time-to-market. Management expects these designs will be an area of growth.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, management expects Q4 FY2024 royalty revenues to grow 30% year-over-year. AI needs energy-efficient computers, which is a core competency of Arm’s architecture. Another strength is the large community of developers that develops on Arm. All these tailwinds make Arm Holdings one of the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom its IT service management roots, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is becoming a powerhouse in AI-driven digital workflow solutions. Today, its software-as-a-service solution stands out for its application of AI to streamline business operations. Taking the strength of its Now Platform, NOW stock is one of the best AI stocks to buy.\n\nThe Now Platform integrates AI and analytics directly into digital workflows, automating routine tasks. Furthermore, it features AI Search, powered by natural language understanding and machine learning. With this capability, users receive personalized and context-aware responses. As a result, resolution times are better, leading to improved user satisfaction.\n\nServiceNow is seeing tremendous growth as customers rush to implement its generative AI solutions. For instance, Siemens AG (OTCMKTS:SIEGY) is utilizing Now Assist in its human resource department to resolve workforce cases faster. A second example is that developers are using its text-to-code feature, increasing productivity by 50%.\n\nDue to the AI features on the Now Platform, revenues are soaring, with 168 deals exceeding $1 million in net new annual contract value in Q4 2023. The company is also seeing growth in the government sector, a previously underpenetrated vector. It has signed deals with U.S. federal, state and local authorities and international governments like Australia and the U.K.\n\nAs AI products like Now Assist, Vancouver and Virtual Agent gain traction, management is confident of its $10 billion ACV target. In FY2024, they project stronger-than-expected growth and estimate subscription revenues between $10.555 and $10.575 billion, up 21.5%. The Now Platform is helping organizations accelerate growth and boost productivity with AI, making NOW stock a must-buy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis semiconductor giant is the backbone of AI research and applications. Nvidia’s role in AI cannot be overstated. The company’s GPUs, such as the A100 and the cutting-edge H100 Tensor Core GPU, are foundational to training complex AI models.\n\nToday, Nvidia’s H100, built on the Hopper architecture, represents the pinnacle of AI innovation. The piece of hardware offers unprecedented compute efficiency and scalability for AI workloads. Revenues are soaring as cloud services providers, governments and organizations look to secure these leading-edge GPUs.\n\nWhile competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) try to catch up, Nvidia is surging ahead with next-generation releases. In August 2023, it unveiled the Hopper GH200, with deliveries set for the second quarter of 2024. It also has the Black GB200 planned for a later release per the product road map. These latest options offer faster training of larger, more sophisticated models across various applications.\n\nThe company’s dominance also extends beyond hardware to software. CUDA, its parallel computing platform, has become the default for developers training AI models. CUDA, plus its software libraries to support AI practitioners, have enhanced its competitive advantage.\n\nEven though NVDA stock has run up over 40% year-to-date, it’s still one of the best AI stocks to buy. Consensus estimates call for 268% and 68% EPS growth in FY2024 and FY2025, respectively. The EPS estimate for the year ending January 2025 is $20.71, valuing the company at 35 times forward earnings.\n\nNVDA stock remains on Goldmans’ conviction buy list, with analyst Toshiya Hari recently bumping the price target from $625 to $800. New product cycles and increasing AI use cases will spur more revenue growth. It is one of the best-positioned stocks to capitalize on AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company's stock price is a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we'll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth-quarter earnings on February 21.\n\nArtificial intelligence. Nvidia is the tech industry's go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative models.

Their shares were up 1.8% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nOther rate-sensitive megacaps Meta Platforms and Nvidia and other chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm gained between 1.6% and 2.2%.\n\nThe indexes had slumped to over one-week lows on Tuesday and the blue-chip Dow posted its worst day in 11 months, as core consumer prices in January stayed at nearly double the Fed's 2% target, forcing investors to reassess their rate cut expectations.\n\n\"What's most disconcerting, is the pick up in inflation almost across the board, and certainly in the service side, obviously the hottest part of the economy,\" said Paul Nolte, senior wealth advisor and market strategist for Murphy & Sylvest.\n\n\"I'm not ready to say that inflation is returning back to the 4%-5% level, nor am I ready to say it's just a bump in the road heading down back down to 2%.\"\n\nProviding some relief were Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee's comments that the path back to 2% inflation target would still be on track even if price increases run a bit hotter-than-expected going ahead, and the central bank should be wary of waiting too long before cutting rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nEuphoria around an early start to monetary policy easing had fueled a Wall Street rally since November, paving the way for a bull market for the S&P 500 this year.\n\nHowever, policymakers might have to wait a bit longer for more evidence of easing price pressures in the face of a resilient U.S. economy.\n\nBets for an at least 25-basis-point rate reduction in May stood at 37%, down from 63% earlier in the week, while expectations for June stood at 78.6%, the CME FedWatch tool showed.\n\nAt 9:50 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 58.98 points, or 0.15%, at 38,331.73, the S&P 500 was up 24.26 points, or 0.49%, at 4,977.43, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 93.83 points, or 0.60%, at 15,749.43.\n\nTen out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors advanced, led by a 1% gain in the communication services sector, while the small-caps Russell 2000 index added 1.4%.\n\nLyft surged 31.6% after the ride-hailing platform's profit beat estimates and it said it would generate positive free cash flow for the first time in 2024.\n\nRival Uber gained 8.8%, also boosted by a $7-billion share buyback plan.\n\nRobinhood Markets jumped 14.8% following a surprise fourth-quarter profit.\n\nCrypto stocks like Coinbase, Marathon Digital and Riot surged between 10.5% and 14.7% as bitcoin's market value crossed $1 trillion for the first time since Nov. 21.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.68-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 21 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 24 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju Samuel)",

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "The market expects Nvidia (NVDA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +412.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $20.18 billion, up 233.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.88% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\n\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.26%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $3.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.02, delivering a surprise of +19.64%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nNvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Microsoft overtook Apple last month to become the largest U.S. company.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to post $11.38 billion in fourth-quarter profit, up more than a staggering 400% from a year ago. Its revenue is expected to surge over three-fold to $20.37 billion.\n\nNvidia now trades 33.19 times its forward earnings estimates, above the industry median multiple of 27.35, per LSEG data.\n\nA higher multiple indicates the stock is more likely to have priced in its earnings potential, leaving little room for further growth.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",

        "title": "The Only 3 Generative AI Stocks Investors Need",
        "content": "Investors can expose themselves to the 47% annual growth expected from the generative AI market by  2030 through three stocks. The names probably won’t surprise many investors. Simplicity is king, and the AI leaders of today are highly likely to be in control throughout the 2020s.\n\nThis article advocates for a long-term perspective that is simple yet highly likely to produce strong results. Artificial intelligence truly emerged in 2023. In 2024, investors will look for the next best way to cash in on any missed returns. However, rather than finding the next needle in the haystack, why not stick with what works?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) started 2024 with bullish news regarding its growth potential, which continues to boost its stock. A few weeks back, the company projected 20% growth or greater based on strong expectations of high-end AI high chip growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoughly 3 weeks later, the company released its January revenue report. That report showed a 22% increase in revenues from December. Investors are broadly aware of the reach Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has within the chip industry. It is, of course, the largest foundry globally and produces roughly half of all chips.\n\nInvestors should also note that the sites rating TSM are wildly in favor of it as an investment. One believes it is better than 94% of all competitors in the semiconductor industry, While another puts that figure at a slightly higher 97%. The more important idea is that both believe Taiwan Semiconductor possesses excellent potential to outperform in 2024. The company’s bullish outlook and January sales figures greatly substantiate that notion.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an obvious choice as one of the only three generative AI stocks investors need. The argument of whether Nvidia is overpriced or still undervalued will continue throughout 2024. Yet, investors should consider several factors and take a bullish stance.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors remain on the fence about Nvidia at the moment. One commonly cited bearish argument is that Nvidia is simply overvalued. Is it? Its P/E ratio of 92.48 today has been almost three times as high in the past decade.\n\nThere’s a great case to be made, and its valuation is very well justified. Investors can pretty much take their pick of profitability metrics to make that case. Whether it’s gross margin, operating margin, return on equity, or return on invested capital, Nvidia scores highly. Further, the company has grown its revenues over the past three years at 34.5%.\n\nNvidia is a hyper-growth firm with a market capitalization of $1.7 trillion. There are few comparables, so it makes sense that investors have questions. Yet, AI is emerging rapidly, and Nvidia is a clear leader with strong moats, so investors should push their trepidations aside.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) established a dominant position in generative AI early in 2023. The story of its OpenAI investment has been told and retold so that I won’t belabor it again. Consider that MSFT stock should continue to Boom in 2024 for a simple reason.\n\nMicrosoft is a leader in the North American generative AI industry, which dominates globally. North American firms control roughly 50% of the market share for generative AI. Microsoft and Nvidia contain a large portion of that market—for example, Microsoft and OpenAI control 69% of the models and platform segment market share.\n\nMicrosoft’s cloud computing segment is a particular bright spot. Cloud revenue grew by 24% in the most recent earnings, reaching $33.7 billion. The company has implemented AI throughout its various businesses and for its various partners. Microsoft has an extensive partner network, and that exposes the company to growth in AI at scale.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Track as Bitcoin Price Roars Past $50,000",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally, which had somewhat stalled over the past month, is showing signs of a rebound, with Bitcoin (BTC) racing past $50,000 on Feb 12 for the first time in more than two years.\n\nBitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency at one point jumped to $50,334, its highest level since December 2021. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) also jumped to $2,638.62 at one point, its highest level since Jan 12.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin’s price declined marginally after reaching the milestone and hovered around $49,000, it goes without saying that the positive sentiment has returned after a brief halt.\n\nIn early January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in a major reform, approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a historic event in the crypto space.\n\nThe decision was widely expected and Bitcoin price hit $47,000 after that. However, Bitcoin prices started declining, largely as investors’ sentiment was somewhat dented owing to outflows from the Grayscale and Bitcoin ETF.\n\nBy the end of January, Bitcoin saw a sharp decline, with the price falling to nearly $39,000. However, the positive sentiment is back, driven by several positive factors.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady over the past five months and has indicated multiple rate cuts in 2024 after inflation declined sharply over the past year. Lower interest rates typically have a favorable impact on growth-oriented sectors, including technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso, the recent decision by the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs is expected to provide a long-term boost to the cryptocurrency space as it will push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance.\n\nMoreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in the first half of 2024 and is projected to halve the mining reward for new blocks. Historically, this event has increased scarcity, making it more difficult for miners to obtain net Bitcoins, leading to a jump in Bitcoin's value due to stringent supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, the broader market is performing well, with the S&P 500 hitting 5,000 for the first time in history. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow hit new intra-day highs on Feb 12, which added to the positive sentiment.\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence, and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.\n\nNVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 268.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. Currently, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nBlackRock, Inc. BLK is one of the world’s largest investment managers and is publicly owned. BLK was one of the first companies from the traditional market to join the Bitcoin ETF race back in June 2023.\n\nBlackRock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5% over the last 60 days. BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nCME Group Inc.’s CME options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 15.9%.

        "title": "Get Rich Quick With These 3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Augmented reality is admittedly in its infancy, but we can expect the sector to accelerate as recent innovations bring products to market and (ultimately) drive costs downward. Market value forecasts are a tricky metric to establish, but conservative estimates point to augmented reality being worth as much as $58 billion by 2028 while driving $38 billion in sales this year alone. This is an important consideration when investing in AR stocks.\n\nAs with any new and emergent tech, plenty of newcomers, upstarts, and startups are flooding the scene in a bid for investor attention. Of course, not all of these will come out on top. If you’re looking for augmented reality stocks, the best bet today is to stick with names you know – and these AR stocks are household names for a reason.\n\nSo here are three AR stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\n\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track to hit a record-setting $4 trillion market cap next year, with much of its newfound acceleration coming from augmented reality. While not staggering, the company’s already sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets, which is no mean feat at a $3,499 price tag. We’ll likely see sales accelerate as early adopters prove the product’s capabilities and, eventually, unit costs drop.\n\nOf course, a going concern moving forward is that the Vision Pro could begin to cannibalize sales across Apple product lines, specifically tablets and iPads, sales of which are already on a downswing. Apple is at an inflection point: while they wait for Vision Pro sales to settle and stabilize, they’re also waiting to see whether the new hardware and augmented reality tech is a mere diversion or represents what the iPod did in the mid-2000s. Either way – Apple is easily the dominant augmented reality stock today and the best bet for a blue-chip inroad into the emerging market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a close runner-up to Apple but may not stay in second place for long. In one major consumer review, Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro are neck-and-neck at four stars each – but the Quest Pro’s pricing is a fraction of Apple’s. This sets Meta up not as an inferior discount to Apple but as a cost leader able to innovate without brand-name bloat often associated with Apple. this makes it one of those AR stocks to consider.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Zuckerberg and the team have something brewing under the surface that likely relates to its augmented reality initiatives. In mid-January, Zuckerberg revealed billions of dollars worth of spending on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. While Meta’s AI initiatives doubtlessly contribute to the total, the company’s burgeoning “massive compute infrastructure” will just as likely service augmented reality platforms to boot – especially once integrated with AI.\n\nLike Apple, Meta is on the blue-chip side of augmented reality stocks, making it a safer bet to capture new trends as the sector develops.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An abstract illustration of an adult wearing an AR/VR headset.\n\nSource: Andrush via Shutterstock\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of today’s largest augmented reality manufacturers. As such, it likely won’t let new entrants or existing competitors take over its position. The company’s joint venture with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) solidifies its industry-leading hardware role and could be the next big thing as augmented reality markets mature.\n\nThis partnership aims to create a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, leveraging Qualcomm’s technology, Samsung’s hardware, and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. No specific product announcement has been announced.

        "title": "3 Reasons Nvidia’s Stock Is Still a Must-Buy AI Powerhouse in 2024",
        "content": "Any Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock outlook has to start by considering its staggering gain of more than 240% last year. The company’s share price has risen nearly 46%, and we’re only now heading into mid-February.\n\nNvidia could have another successful year because of the high demand for its AI solutions. Nvidia is a favorable choice because of the ongoing AI trend. The below NVDA stock outlook says this company is still a strong buy.\n\nAI Demand Continues Unabated\n\nNvidia dominates about 81% of the market for AI chips used in cloud and data centers. Until AMD‘s (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips gain traction, this will be the case for the time being.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile there has certainly been “AI hype” in the past several months as businesses have tried to hop on the artificial intelligence train with their own “AI-enhanced” products. What is not hyped up, however, is the demand for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nBecause of U.S. export, Nvidia’s chips have become more expensive in Asia, but this has not quelled demand for these chips in the region. The RTX 4090 has been difficult to find in Taiwan and parts of Southeast Asia, for example.\n\nThe AI craze has also hit Japan with some local semiconductor equipment manufacturers seeing a boost in revenue and profits off of sustained demand for AI chips. Nvidia also announced a $1 billion deal to provide India-based companies with its AI chips.\n\nThis is likely just the beginning of the ripple effect these chips are having on the international stage.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Nvidia invested in over 2 dozen AI start-ups in 2023, which made the chip maker the most active investor in the space for that year. With more than $18 billion on its balance sheet as the third quarter of 2023, it’s no wonder why the company has been eager to invest.\n\nThese investments can work out in the long run, especially as the AI space goes beyond generative AI and includes various kinds of applications. Nvidia will probably always be there to provide the chips to train AI models, but the chip maker can get the best out of the AI boom by making bets on capable companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA Stock Outlook: Valuation Not Too High\n\nNvidia’s stock is trading at a record high, but its forward P/E ratio is still well below where it was 12 months ago. Then, the stock was trading at over 54.2x forward earnings.\n\nNowadays, the chip maker’s stock trades for just 36.3x forward earnings. This puts Nvidia’s earnings multiple below that of its key competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nThat’s all to say, despite Nvidia’s valuation looking expensive, it is much less than it was in prior months. The company’s continued growth in the coming months will likely justify where its multiple is sitting now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "I’ve been sending loud-and-clear signals on China-based electric vehicle manufacturer Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) this year, and I’m only getting more bullish now. I predict higher prices for LI stock, especially with an upcoming data release. Bullish catalysts for Li Auto include stimulus programs in China and the company’s autonomous driving chip deal with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nPlus, Li Auto is preparing to launch its flagship multi-purpose vehicle, known as the Li MEGA, on March 1. Yet, March 1 isn’t the only date you need to mark on your calendar. Indeed, February could be Li Auto’s most consequential month of 2024, and it’s not too late to buy LI stock in anticipation of a positive surprise.\n\nAn Amazing January for Li Auto\n\nJanuary 2024 is now in the history books, but it was an unforgettable month for Li Auto. After all, who could possibly forget a month in which Li Auto literally doubled its vehicle deliveries?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore specifically, Li Auto delivered 31,165 vehicles in January of this year. This represents 105.8% growth when compared to January 2023. Li Auto recorded 664,529 cumulative vehicle deliveries at the end of January – not too shabby, you must admit.\n\nAnother positive sign for Li Auto is that the company, according to a South China Morning Post report, has been distributing “fat bonuses” to some workers for exceeding the company’s 2023 sales target. Li Auto had established a 300,000-vehicle sales target for 2023, but actually sold 376,030 vehicles.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that you should buy LI stock just because Li Auto is handing out “fat bonuses.” I’m highlighting signs of a financially and operationally healthy company.\n\nThis Day Will Be Huge for LI Stock Traders\n\nSo far, I’ve laid out the bullish argument in favor of Li Auto stock. However, there’s also an argument for buying shares today instead of waiting and hesitating.\n\nStory continues\n\nOr at least, consider buying shares before Feb. 26. That’s when Li Auto is set to release its results for 2023’s fourth quarter and the full year.\n\nLI stock has been in a general downtrend since last summer, so Feb. 26 could mark a major turning point. Check out Li Auto’s quarterly EPS track record, and you’ll find that the automaker has several EPS beats in a row and has also grown its EPS over time.\n\nThis will be Li Auto’s chance to deliver another Street beat as well as another quarter of sequential EPS growth. Besides, Li Auto really shone in December, delivering 50,353 vehicles, up 137.1% year over year. So, why shouldn’t the fourth-quarter report be a blockbuster for Li Auto?\n\nLI Stock Outlook: It’s About to Pop Off\n\nIn case you couldn’t tell, my LI stock outlook is definitely bullish in the near term. With Li Auto’s quarterly report set to be released on Feb. 26, investors should prepare for a blastoff.\n\nThe long-term outlook is also highly favorable for Li Auto stock. You’ve seen the company’s vehicle-delivery growth and track record of EPS beats. Hence, today is the best day to start or add to a confident share position in Li Auto.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia. 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds more promise than any technology in history. It has already proven its ability to complete some tasks in a fraction of the time that humans can, from summarizing lengthy documents to writing computer code in a matter of seconds. Depending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, it could add anywhere from $7 trillion to $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster child of the AI revolution because its data center chips have been critical to the development, training, and deployment of almost every significant AI model to date. Surging data center revenue has catapulted the company to a market capitalization of almost $1.8 trillion -- and $1 trillion of that value has been added in the past 12 months alone.\n\nThere is still scope for upside in Nvidia stock, especially if Wall Street's AI forecasts prove accurate. But I'm going to explain why Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and C3.ai(NYSE: AI) are better value AI plays right now.\n\n1. Oracle: Positioned as a leader in generative AI infrastructure\n\nOracle was founded in 1977, and its early success came from its database management software. Today, it's one of the largest providers of cloud computing services under its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment, which operates 66 data centers around the world.\n\nBut each of those 66 data centers is now being expanded, and Oracle is building 100 more. Why? Because the company is experiencing such a significant surge in demand for AI infrastructure that it simply can't keep up. CTO Larry Ellison says Oracle's Nvidia graphics processor (GPU) cluster technology is the most advanced in the industry, offering developers the ability to train AI models at twice the speed and half the cost of its competitors.\n\nOracle's latest data centers are called Gen2 Cloud, and automation is at their core. Ellison says there is no cost difference between managing 10 data centers and 100 data centers (from an operational standpoint), which translates to savings for customers. In fact, Gen2 Cloud has attracted leading generative AI start-ups like Cohere, Adept AI, and even Elon Musk's xAI, and they have already committed to spending billions of dollars on Gen2 capacity.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30, 2023), the OCI segment delivered $1.6 billion in revenue, a 52% year-over-year increase. That blew away the 5% growth rate of Oracle's business overall. Even though OCI only accounts for 12% of the company's total revenue, Ellison believes it will maintain its 50% growth rate for years to come, so it could soon become the centerpiece of the Oracle story.\n\nOracle has generated $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, and based on its current stock price of $116.64, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.2. That is marginally more expensive than the 31.7 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Index, but it's substantially cheaper than the 58.5 P/E ratio of Nvidia.\n\nIronically, one of the things stopping Oracle from completing its new data center projects more quickly is Nvidia, which is suffering from a supply constraint for its popular chips. Once that hurdle is overcome, Oracle could be set for substantial long-term growth from all of that new industry-leading infrastructure.\n\n2. C3.ai: A small-cap stock with explosive potential\n\nC3.ai is valued at just $3.4 billion, so it's tiny compared to Nvidia, but its contribution to AI has been significant. The company was founded in 2009, and it was the first provider of enterprise AI services -- in other words, C3.ai was the first company to develop ready-made, customizable AI applications for businesses, so they could use the technology to supercharge their operations.\n\nToday, C3.ai offers more than 40 applications suitable for organizations in at least 10 different industries. Retailers, for example, can use C3.ai to boost transaction volume and minimize supply chain costs by allowing AI to generate predictive insights based on customer and transaction data. Similarly, banks can use C3.ai as the ultimate fraud-fighting tool -- one customer saw a whopping 200% increase in the number of suspicious activity cases identified after adopting C3.ai, which were previously going unnoticed.\n\nC3.ai had 404 customer engagements during the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31, 2023), which was an 81% year-over-year increase. That growth rate marked an acceleration over the previous two quarters, which highlights how quickly demand for AI software is scaling in the corporate world.\n\nC3.ai is still focusing on growth, so it isn't a profitable company just yet. Its revenue increased by 17% in Q2, the fastest pace in more than a year. C3.ai is transitioning away from a subscription-based revenue model and toward a consumption-based model instead. This will eliminate lengthy contract negotiations and allow customers to sign up more quickly, which is great in the long run.\n\nManagement knew the transition would lead to a temporary slowdown in revenue growth, but the worst appears to be over, and a reacceleration is clearly underway.\n\nC3.ai stock soared 156% in 2023, but it's still trading 82% below its all-time high set during the tech frenzy in 2020. Investors assigned an irrational valuation to the company back then, but the steep drop is now an enticing opportunity.\n\nBased on C3.ai's $284.7 million in trailing-12-month revenue and its current market cap of $3.4 billion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. That makes it substantially cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at a P/S ratio of 30.1. Nvidia is growing its revenue far more quickly, so its stock deserves to trade at a premium, but it's unlikely that will last forever.\n\nC3.ai's business, however, is on the upswing, and it can be bought at a steep discount to its best-ever level. That might be the better long-term play.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThose waiting for the artificial intelligence bubble to pop have been let down this earnings season.\n\nIn the latest sign that AI exuberance is alive and well in markets, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock has surged more than 70% in the last five days of trading after topping Wall Street's earnings estimates on Feb. 7.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, the chipmaker attributed its better-than-expected revenue forecast to artificial intelligence.\n\n\"When you think about artificial general intelligence, that's going to drive the need for more compute in a way that we've never seen before,\" Arm CEO Rene Haas told investors on the company's earnings call. \"So as good as the last couple of quarters were, we're just at the beginning.\"\n\nArm soared nearly 50% in the next day of trading.\n\nShares at one point doubled from their pre-earnings price before a hotter-than-expected inflation report tempered the recent risk-on narrative in markets. Amid a broader market sell-off, Arm shares tumbled nearly 20% on Tuesday.\n\nAnd while investors are buying the potential benefits, Wall Street is a bit more cautious on how the disruptive technology fully contributes to earnings growth for Arm moving forward.\n\nNeedham & Company analyst Charles Shi told Yahoo Finance Live that the firm isn't even sure Arm is that much of an AI play, with its current exposure to generative AI \"quite small.\"\n\n\"It remains to be seen whether they can actually benefit from generative AI going into the future,\" Shi said.\n\nThis has become a prevailing theme among other popular AI trades like C3.ai (AI) and Palantir (PLTR). Wall Street wants to see further actual results and investors just want to hear more AI mentions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Shi pointed out, a company with even the slightest sprinkle of generative AI sends investors into a frenzy and valuations sky-high. Additionally, some Wall Street analysts have also noted that since only around 10% of Arm's outstanding shares are publicly traded — the rest is controlled by SoftBank — volatility in the name is to be expected.\n\nAnd this also underscores the fact that investors may only have a vague idea what these companies even do. Arm, for its part, is on the ground floor of technological developments as it produces instruction sets to help chips like those made by Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and just about every other major industry player operate. Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas rings the Nasdaq opening bell at the Nasdaq MarketSite on Sept. 14, 2023, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nBut the Arm stock story remains largely a sign that investors are still following a familiar playbook for the AI trade — a company surprises Wall Street expectations for future revenues and attributes this beat to the disruptive technology.\n\nThe playbook goes back to last May, when Nvidia issued revenue guidance that topped Street expectations by about 53%.\n\nAnd since then, investors have simply lowered the bar on what level of AI promise they're willing to pay up for.\n\nFor instance, Arm projected revenue in the current quarter to hit $850 million to $900 million, 16% above Wall Street's estimates for $778 million. An impressive forecast raise, but nowhere near Nvidia's massive call last May.\n\nYahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman contributed reporting to this story.  morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 46% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study NVIDIA's  ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:\n\n57% = US$19b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.57.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 57% ROE\n\nTo begin with, NVIDIA has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 14% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 28% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe then performed a comparison between NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 27% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is NVIDIA fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.\n\nIs NVIDIA Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nNVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.4%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like NVIDIA is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.\n\nMoreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 0.6% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in NVIDIA's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 78%, over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 14, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Amazon.com AMZN, e.l.f. Beauty ELF, Wingstop WING, Flowserve FLS and NVIDIA NVDA.\n\nPlay Potential Earnings Beats with These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks\n\nIt is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that can beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.\n\nWhy Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?\n\nHistorically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.\n\nThus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.\n\nHow to Find Stocks that Can Beat?\n\nNow, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.\n\nAn impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere are five out of 17 stocks:\n\nAmazon.com: The Zacks Rank #1 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 51.047%.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty: Zacks Rank #2 e.l.f.

Its cosmetic category primarily consists of face makeup, eye makeup, lip products, nail products and cosmetics sets/kits, but excludes beauty tools and accessories, such as brushes and applicators.\n\nThe average earnings surprise of ELF for the past four quarters is 69.23%.\n\nWingstop: Wingstop Inc. franchises and operates restaurants. The company's operating segment consists of Franchise and Company.

        "title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Nvidia in 2019, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",
        "content": "Today, semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is a tremendous company worth over $1.7 trillion. Those who bought and held shares many years back are very wealthy today.\n\nBut thinking that you've missed the boat because you were late can be a costly mistake. You could have invested $10,000 in Nvidia just five years ago and still be sitting on $195,000 in gains today.\n\nNobody knew five years ago that artificial intelligence (AI) would impact Nvidia as it has, but that's the thing with great companies -- fortune tends to find them. The cycle repeats. There are investors right now thinking they've missed out on Nvidia. But as you'll see below, that's not necessarily true.\n\nHere is why.\n\nNvidia is cornering the AI chip market\n\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that Nvidia is dominating the AI chip market. It's become widely known how the company jumped out to a quick lead, illustrated by exploding growth that began several quarters ago. Industry analysts estimate that Nvidia's early market share is between 80% and 95%. The technology sector's most prominent companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms, flocked to the company's flagship H100 and H200 series AI chips. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nNaturally, these companies, which are buying tens and hundreds of thousands of chips, may try to develop their own chips to save money and optimize their hardware for their own use. It looks like Nvidia is staying proactive here, which should be music to investors' ears.\n\nAccording to a report by Reuters, Nvidia will establish a new business unit for custom AI chips. As companies look for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized AI chips, it potentially opens the door for competitors that can help create these custom chip designs. Nvidia's custom chip unit will try to prevent market share leakage by working with customers looking for alternatives to Nvidia's standardized chip products. Custom chips are predicted to be a $30 billion niche in the AI chip space.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould Nvidia still be cheap?\n\nThings can move fast in the stock market. Nvidia, which trades at over $720 per share, was only $200 a year ago. As you saw in the graph above, the company's growth spurt justified Nvidia's meteoric rise. However, investors must carefully weigh Nvidia stock's future potential versus its price tag.\n\nAs the calendar turns over, Nvidia's stock is pricing in the next fiscal year's earnings. Shares trade roughly 35 times its estimated earnings for the year ending January 2025. Remarkably, analysts' long-term growth estimates signal the stock is still arguably cheap on a forward-looking basis. That's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio under 1. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nOn the other hand, analysts have set a very high bar, and coming up short could cause a painful contraction in the stock price. In other words, the stock is a riskier investment today than a year ago because expectations are higher.\n\nHow investors should approach Nvidia stock\n\nTime is a superpower for individual investors who don't need to meet quarterly performance quotas for their clients like hedge fund managers do. Naturally, a stock that has risen as much as Nvidia could easily see a pullback. But given the overwhelming evidence of Nvidia's AI dominance, now and moving forward, it may be unwise to avoid the stock altogether, holding out for a price that may never come.\n\nThat's why investors should dollar-cost average into Nvidia stock. Buying a little at a time will help investors build a position at various price points, automatically averaging down if the stock does take a fall. Plus, holding Nvidia with a multiyear time frame in mind will increase the odds that investors realize the company's long-term growth as investment returns.\n\nIt's much easier to imagine Nvidia being a much bigger company 10 years from now than to guess Nvidia's quarterly results and the market's reaction to them. Playing the long game will help investors get more out of the stock, especially as Nvidia's new-found growth opens up potential share repurchases and dividend growth over the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Plunge 43% to 88%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Last week, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 surged to record highs, while the growth-powered Nasdaq Composite came within a stone's throw of eclipsing its all-time closing high from November 2021. Though growth stocks are most directly responsible for this move higher in the broader market, the more specific trend that's spurring this rally is excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI uses software and systems to undertake tasks that would normally be done by humans. The key ingredient is machine learning, which allows AI-driven software and systems to effectively learn over time and become smarter and more effective at their tasks.\n\nThe beauty of AI is that it isn't just grounded in the technology space. It has application in virtually all sectors and industries, which is why the analysts at PwC believe it can add an estimated $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by the turn of the decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHowever, not every Wall Street analyst is on board with the AI hype train. Based on the bottom-of-the-barrel price targets provided by select analysts, three of the highest-flying and/or widely owned AI stocks could plunge between 43% and 88%.\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 43%\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could quickly lose its luster, at least according to one Wall Street analyst, is the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement: semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). According to analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, Nvidia is worth $410 per share, which as of its close at $721 on Feb. 9 implies 43% downside.\n\nThough Luria acknowledges that Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the undeniable go-to for high-compute data centers, he cautions against getting swept up by the short-term euphoria. Luria's January 2024 note that set the $410 price target anticipates that Nvidia's growth trends \"will start reverting to the trend line within the next two to six quarters.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEvery next-big-thing trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an initial period of unsustainable hype. While this doesn't mean that companies in the AI space won't, eventually, be successful, it makes it highly unlikely that enterprise demand can match or surpass the already lofty expectations of investors.\n\nThe bigger issue for Nvidia is that it's set to face mounting external and internal competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out GPUs designed to challenge Nvidia's top-notch hardware. AMD is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-accelerated GPU, while Intel expects to bring its Gaudi3 generative AI software chip to market sometime this year.\n\nWith regard to external competition, many of Nvidia's largest customers from a sales perspective are developing their own AI-focused chips. This includes Microsoft and Meta Platforms, which are the respective No. 1 and No. 2 in spending with Nvidia.\n\nPerhaps the nail in the coffin for Nvidia could be that increasing production of its A100 and H100 chips is liable to hurt its gross margin. Much of the company's sales growth in fiscal 2024 (ended in late January) was the result of AI-GPU scarcity. When Nvidia boosts its own output, it'll be inadvertently cannibalizing its pricing power.\n\nThis outlier price target for Nvidia might prove realistic, based on what history tells us about early-stage bubbles in next-big-thing trends.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 66%\n\nA second supercharged AI stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes could implode, based on its closing share price of $740.29 on Feb. 9, is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Senior equity research analyst Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna recently defended his $250 price target on Super Micro on CNBC, which if accurate would translate into implied downside of 66%.\n\nShares of Super Micro are up 751% over the trailing year and a scorching-hot 160% in the six weeks since 2024 began. These phenomenal gains are being driven by the company's energy-efficient and customizable servers that are proving integral to enterprise-operated AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nSuper Micro has a very close-knit relationship with Nvidia (it uses Nvidia's GPUs in its high-end servers), which also helps to explain its astronomical gains.\n\nBut even with its full-year sales forecast coming in well ahead of its own prior estimates in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ends June 30), there are potential headwinds that could disrupt this highflier.\n\nAs noted, investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the adoption of new technologies and innovations. Super Micro Computer was in this situation a little over a half-decade ago as one of the expected beneficiaries of rapid growth in cloud computing.\n\nHowever, Super Micro's growth ultimately fell well short of what optimists had initially expected. While this hasn't been the case early on in the AI cycle, there's a precedent that bubbles are common with next-big-thing trends.\n\nSomething else to consider is that Super Micro's growth is currently constrained by AI-GPU scarcity. Even though Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, there's the real possibility Super Micro Computer's growth will be held back by supply constraints.\n\nAnd Super Micro's ability to defend its intellectual property (IP) could be called into question. While it's having no trouble riding Nvidia's coattails for the time being, my Foolish colleague Nicholas Rossolillo pointed out in early January that a majority of the company's enterprise computing and storage systems haven't been granted patents or lack IP protections. This suggests competition could eventually siphon away market share from Super Micro Computer. A Tesla Model S charging. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla: Implied downside of 88%\n\nThe third AI stock that could absolutely plunge, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Longtime Tesla bear and GLJ Research founder and CEO Gordon Johnson has a $23.53 price target on the world's largest automaker by market cap. This implies a jaw-dropping 88% downside from where shares closed this past week.\n\nJohnson's oddly specific price target was arrived at by placing a 15 multiple on his earnings estimate for Tesla in 2025 and applying a 9% discount rate to arrive at the current price.\n\nAlthough Tesla isn't as directly an AI company as Nvidia or Super Micro Computer are, its vehicles are increasingly reliant on technology and AI in a fiercely competitive industry. For instance, Tesla's full self-driving software is an example of advanced technology that uses cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to steer a vehicle away from potential obstacles.\n\nDespite being the only pure-play EV maker that's currently profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Tesla does look ripe for a breakdown.\n\nSince the start of 2023, it has slashed the sales price of its four production models (the 3, S, X, and Y) on more than a half-dozen occasions. CEO Elon Musk has been crystal clear that Tesla's price strategy is based on demand for the company's EVs. Ongoing price cuts suggest that increasing competition and rising inventory levels are taking their toll.\n\nThe proof of this can also be seen in Tesla's operating margin. Since the September-ended quarter of 2022, the company's operating margin has been more than halved to 8.2%. With price cuts continuing into 2024 and days of supply remaining high, relative to previous years, there's the real possibility of continued operating-margin contraction.\n\nWhat's more, Tesla is generating a sizable percentage of its pretax profit from unsustainable sources, such as interest income and regulatory tax credits. This isn't something you would expect to see from a high-growth company with a big premium.\n\nLastly, Musk has arguably proved to be more of a risk than a benefit to Tesla. Putting aside his encounters with securities regulators, Musk has frequently made innovative promises he has yet to keep. If those unfulfilled innovations are backed out of Tesla's valuation, Johnson's seemingly lowball price target becomes realistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Recent Transaction Overview\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Renaissance Technologies, led by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), made a notable adjustment to its investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF). The firm sold 126,100 shares of the nutrition company at a trade price of $15.26 per share. Following this transaction, Renaissance Technologies holds a total of 5,926,601 shares in Herbalife, which represents a 5.98% ownership in the company and a 0.15% position in the firm's portfolio.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) and Renaissance Technologies\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HLF.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), a renowned mathematician and quantitative investor, founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. The firm has since become one of the most successful hedge funds globally, known for its use of complex mathematical models and automated trading strategies. Renaissance Technologies' approach to the market is grounded in data analysis and scientific thinking, aiming to identify non-random price movements for predictive trading. As of now, the firm manages an equity portfolio worth $64.61 billion, with top holdings in technology and healthcare sectors, including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Jim Simons Adjusts Position in Herbalife Ltd\n\nHerbalife Ltd at a Glance\n\nHerbalife Ltd, based in the Cayman Islands, operates as a global nutrition company, offering health and wellness products through a direct-selling model in 95 markets. The company's product portfolio includes weight management shakes, targeted nutrition supplements, and energy and fitness products. With a market capitalization of $1.17 billion and a P/E ratio of 6.31, Herbalife's financials reflect a company that is currently undervalued according to GuruFocus's GF Value, with a stock price to GF Value ratio of 0.44. The stock's current price stands at $11.8, which is significantly below the GF Value of $26.95.\n\nStory continues Jim Simons Adjusts Position in Herbalife Ltd\n\nImpact of the Trade on Simons' Portfolio\n\nThe recent sale of Herbalife shares by Renaissance Technologies has a minimal immediate impact on the firm's extensive portfolio. However, the reduction in Herbalife's position size, now at 0.15%, indicates a strategic decision by Simons to adjust the firm's exposure to the consumer packaged goods industry. This move could be a response to the stock's recent performance or a shift in the firm's investment strategy.\n\nHerbalife's Market Performance and Valuation\n\nSince the trade date, Herbalife's stock has experienced a decline of 22.67%, with a year-to-date drop of 23.18%. Despite this downward trend, the company's long-term performance since its IPO in 2004 shows a significant increase of 237.14%. The current stock price represents a substantial discount to the GF Value, suggesting that the stock may be significantly undervalued.\n\nFinancial Health and Growth Prospects\n\nHerbalife's financial health is a mixed picture, with a Financial Strength rank of 4/10 and a Profitability Rank of 9/10. The company's Growth Rank and GF Value Rank are both at 4/10, indicating moderate growth potential and fair valuation. Herbalife's Momentum Rank also stands at 4/10, reflecting a lack of strong momentum in its stock price.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Other Gurus' Positions\n\nThe Baupost Group is currently the largest guru shareholder in Herbalife, while other notable investment firms like HOTCHKIS & WILEY and Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss also maintain positions in the company. This diversified interest from multiple gurus suggests a mixed market sentiment towards Herbalife's stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' firm, Renaissance Technologies, has reduced its stake in Herbalife Ltd, a move that aligns with the firm's data-driven investment philosophy. Despite the stock's current undervaluation and strong profitability rank, the reduction in position size may reflect a strategic shift or a response to the stock's recent performance. For value investors, the current outlook for Herbalife Ltd warrants attention to the company's financial health, growth prospects, and market sentiment, as these factors will influence the stock's future trajectory.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Latest Investment Move\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CORT.\n\nRenowned investment firm Renaissance Technologies, led by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), has recently increased its stake in Corcept Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:CORT), a pharmaceutical company specializing in the treatment of severe metabolic, oncologic, and neuropsychiatric disorders. On December 29, 2023, the firm added 111,000 shares to its portfolio, reflecting a 0.01% trade impact and bringing its total share count to 6,725,871. This transaction underscores the firm's confidence in Corcept Therapeutics, even as it navigates the volatile biotechnology sector.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) and Renaissance Technologies\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), the CEO of Renaissance Technologies, is a prominent figure in the investment world, known for his firm's data-driven and quantitative approach to trading. Since its inception in 1982, Renaissance Technologies has utilized complex mathematical models to predict market movements and execute trades. This scientific methodology aims to identify non-random price movements and capitalize on them, avoiding reliance on statistical flukes. The firm's portfolio is diverse, with significant holdings in technology and healthcare, including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). With an equity portfolio valued at $64.61 billion, Renaissance Technologies remains a formidable force in the investment landscape. Jim Simons Bolsters Position in Corcept Therapeutics Inc\n\nCorcept Therapeutics at a Glance\n\nCorcept Therapeutics Inc, trading under the symbol CORT, has been a player in the biotechnology industry since its IPO on April 14, 2004. The company's focus on developing medications that modulate the effects of cortisol has positioned it as a leader in addressing complex health conditions. Despite the inherent risks of the biotech sector, Corcept has demonstrated financial resilience, with a market capitalization of $2.38 billion and a stock price that is currently deemed significantly undervalued according to GuruFocus's GF Value. The company's GF Score of 88/100 indicates a strong potential for outperformance, supported by high ranks in financial strength, profitability, and growth.\n\nStory continues Jim Simons Bolsters Position in Corcept Therapeutics Inc\n\nDetails of the Recent Trade\n\nThe acquisition of additional shares in Corcept Therapeutics by Renaissance Technologies took place at a trade price of $32.48. Since then, the stock has experienced a decline, currently trading at $23.05, which represents a -29.03% change. Despite this downturn, the firm's position in Corcept now accounts for 0.37% of its portfolio and 6.52% of the company's outstanding shares, indicating a significant level of commitment to the stock.\n\nPortfolio Impact of Corcept Therapeutics\n\nCorcept Therapeutics holds a strategic position within Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' portfolio, aligning with the firm's focus on technology and healthcare sectors. The recent trade has slightly increased the stock's weight in the portfolio, demonstrating a calculated move by the firm to capitalize on the stock's current undervaluation. This addition is consistent with the firm's investment philosophy of leveraging data analysis to identify market opportunities.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Corcept's Performance\n\nCorcept Therapeutics' stock has faced challenges in the market, with a year-to-date price change ratio of -4.59%. However, the company's long-term performance since its IPO has been positive, with an 88.16% price change. The stock's current valuation metrics, including a PE ratio of 28.46 and a price to GF Value of 0.70, suggest that it is significantly undervalued, potentially offering an attractive entry point for investors.\n\nFinancial Health and Rankings of Corcept Therapeutics\n\nCorcept Therapeutics boasts a robust balance sheet, with a Financial Strength rank of 9/10 and an impressive cash to debt ratio of 1,578.78. The company's Profitability Rank stands at 8/10, while its Growth Rank is a perfect 10/10, indicating strong potential for future expansion. The GF Value Rank also hits the top mark at 10/10, further reinforcing the stock's undervaluation status. However, the Momentum Rank is low at 2/10, reflecting recent market headwinds.\n\nComparative Analysis and Market Sentiment\n\nWhen compared to the largest guru shareholder in Corcept Therapeutics, Gotham Asset Management, LLC, Renaissance Technologies' recent move signals a bullish stance on the stock's prospects. Market sentiment and momentum indicators, such as the RSI and Momentum Index, suggest a mixed outlook, with the stock currently facing some negative pressure. Nonetheless, the firm's decision to increase its holdings may be indicative of a contrarian approach, banking on the company's strong fundamentals and potential for recovery.\n\nTransaction Influence and Outlook\n\nThe recent acquisition by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' firm has a modest yet strategic impact on its portfolio, reinforcing its position in a stock that exhibits strong financial health and growth prospects. While the market has yet to reflect the firm's optimism, the underlying fundamentals of Corcept Therapeutics, combined with its significantly undervalued status, could lead to favorable long-term returns. Investors will be watching closely to see if this calculated addition by one of the world's most successful hedge funds will pay off as anticipated.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "AVGO, CDNS, NOW: Which Strong-Buy-Rated Tech Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "The tech sector has continued to stay hot so far this year. Though valuations may be a tad uncomfortable for those who’ve yet to punch their ticket, it has to be comforting that the Wall Street crowd still views many of the high flyers (like AVGO, CDNS, and NOW) as Strong Buys.\n\nTherefore, in this piece, we’ll look at TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to check in with those three impressive performers in the tech scene with generative artificial intelligence (AI) catalysts that could help them achieve more gains.\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nWhile most of the attention in the semiconductor scene may be focused on the two top AI chip firms, diversified chip play Broadcom has quietly rocketed higher. While the $592 billion chip giant may not be the bountiful dividend payer it once was, it still stands out as one of the higher-growth plays in the semiconductor scene, at least according to many on Wall Street.\n\nTo take it further, I view AVGO stock as sporting a more palatable valuation — 27.4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) — versus many of its chip rivals. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock but acknowledge that near-term turbulence could be in the cards.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that the stock used to command a dividend yield north of 3-4%. After more than doubling (up 112% in the past year), the yield has compressed to 1.64%. Looking back, it’s clear that Broadcom stock should never have fallen below $500 per share back in late 2022. Chalk that one as a misstep made by Mr. Market.\n\nDespite the hot rally (or should I say melt-up) in the stock, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts are raging bulls on Broadcom stock this year, going as far as to call it the biggest AI chip play after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This is partly thanks to Broadcom’s “leadership position in AI-related products” such as high-end AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) — a lower-power alternative to GPUs for AI acceleration.\n\nIndeed, it’s not just about GPUs when it comes to AI hardware. Arguably, ASICs could experience a boom of their own as more firms look to tailor their hardware for specific AI applications. Of course, ASICs can be pricier to build from scratch, but depending on the AI application, I view them as deserving a larger slice of the AI chip pie in the future. When it comes to AI chips, it’s not all about GPUs. And Broadcom is a great way to play the customization chip trend as it looks to go after AI accelerators.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of AVGO Stock?\n\nBroadcom stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average AVGO stock price target of $1,222.22 implies 2.35% downside potential.\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS)\n\nCadence Design Systems is another semiconductor play that’s been incredibly hot lately, but not to the magnitude of Nvidia. Cadence is a take on the chip design side, a corner of the market that itself could be made more efficient through the incorporation of new AI models.\n\nUndoubtedly, chip design is an incredibly complicated field with higher barriers to entry. You need hardware engineers who really know their stuff to make an AI chip that’s up to standards. With AI thrown into the equation, the barriers could be lowered, perhaps drastically.\n\nIndeed, if Cadence can get AI chip design right (early signs suggest that the company is, given the power of its Tensilica platform), there’s no telling how much higher the stock could fly as it looks to widen its moat. All secular growth drivers considered, I view Cadence as one of the most exciting AI plays right now and am staying bullish.\n\nThe only knock on CDNS stock lies in its valuation, with shares going for 76.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, well above the semiconductor industry average of 45.3 times but lower than the application software industry average of 86.1 times. As an application software play with skin in the chip game, I’d argue that the multiple may not be as high as it seems, assuming Cadence can outpace its rivals in the chip design scene.\n\nNonetheless, after releasing its earnings early this week, CDNS stock took a 4% hit to the chin as the firm stepped forward with some unimpressive Q1 guidance. Indeed, shares seemed priced for perfection ahead of the quarter. As shares pull back off their highs in response to the coming quarterly bout of weakness, perhaps dip buyers will finally have a chance to get into a name that has some very powerful secular growth drivers behind it.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of CDNS Stock?\n\nCadence stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with three Buys assigned in the past three months. The average CDNS stock price target of $320.88 implies 9% upside potential.\n\nServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW)\n\nServiceNow is a SaaS (software-as-a-service) workflow management firm that’s also been off to the race since bottoming back in late 2022. The company isn’t just melting up because its robust product is faring better again; investors are excited about the company’s ability to cash in on the AI opportunity.\n\nAccording to ServiceNow’s chief operating officer, generative AI represents a $3 trillion opportunity for software firms. And ServiceNow wants a piece of the pie as it looks to funnel money into AI innovation to help its consumers save money and become more productive. Given this, I can’t help but be bullish on the stock despite the hefty 91.8 times trailing P/E.\n\nServiceNow’s chief executive officer, Bill McDermott, has also been upbeat about generative AI and his firm’s growth prospects. Following the latest quarterly earnings beat, McDermott described AI as a “breakthrough moment.” I think he’s right. The AI boom seems to have already landed for ServiceNow, and there’s no telling how much more impact it could have on future quarters.\n\nThe stock’s expensive, but it’s costly for a reason. Perhaps ServiceNow could be one of the more prominent software winners of the AI boom as it looks to experience its own Nvidia-like melt-up.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of NOW Stock?\n\nServiceNow stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 28 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average NOW stock price target of $851.26 implies 10% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe tech tailwind seems to be alive and well going into February. Though valuations may become stretched, it seems like generative AI could be enough of an earnings growth driver to help firms “catch up” to their now-higher multiples. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside (10%) in shares of NOW for the coming year. ServiceNow certainly does seem to be the best pick of the batch right now as McDermott and his team continue to work their magic.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "The rally we’ve seen in AI stocks has been incredible to watch. Accordingly, investors who have missed this rally may be eager to get in. Fear of missing out is picking up, as investors pile into high-flying names which continue to surge even higher. However, this has led to stocks at risk of a selloff.\n\nHowever, Chris Montagu, a Citigroup strategist has sounded the alarm bells on how increased optimism in United States tech stocks could deepen market downturns. He noted that the investors who have expected more gains, are now running a risk of big-time losses, if this trend reverts.\n\nNevertheless, the S&P 500 climbed to new peaks amid positive tech earnings. However, there are many that are now calling for caution, as interest rate cuts could take longer to materialize. Personally, I’m of the view that this AI-led rally has gone too far in specific names. Here are three I’m most cautious on right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) once stood at the pinnacle of the AI sector, until its share price tumbled more than 50% from its peak of nearly $50 per share in 2023. Recently, AI stock fell 16% because of disappointing financials and stacked-up losses. The company projected a $46 million operating loss, twice the expected amount that Wall Street predicted it would lose. The company also abandoned its profitability target.\n\nC3.ai, a well-funded tech giant, has a patented AI platform that simplifies model integration, opening doors to steady customer acquisition and revenue growth. Despite a small pothole, Q3 revenue nearly doubled over the past four years. Shifting to consumption-based pricing has accelerated growth on the horizon.\n\nWith a price-to-sales ratio of 9.7-times, analysts forecast revenue stepping on the $443 million line in two years. I think this stock could certainly have room to move higher, but like the other picks on this list, I’m remaining cautious. I think more downside risk is likely, given the over-exuberance seen in the AI space. Thus, this is a stock I’m going to be avoiding until there are signs valuations make sense in this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) recently celebrated its fifth consecutive profitable quarter and its first good year, with PLTR stock surging nearly 20% on its incredible earnings beat.\n\nPalantir’s fourth quarter revenue rocketed 25%, with a 70% boost in the U.S. enterprise segment revenue, $131 million. Over $1 billion in commercial revenue was made for the year, with a 32% increase in segment revenue to $284 million.\n\nPalantir’s AI Platform is getting plenty of demand, surpassing its October goals of 500 boot camps. With 560 completed across 45 companies this year, the company’s U.S. customer count has grown by 55% to 221. Palantir expects continued expansion, especially after merging AIP with its Foundry platform. Growth in the public sector stunted and fell to 11% from 23% in the previous year.\n\nOf course, these numbers are certainly welcome, and invite a narrative that AI adoption is finally flowing through to the company’s numbers. However, I’d be wary of extrapolating these results two, three or five years down the road. There’s just too much uncertainty right now, and like the other companies on this list, I think Palantir’s valuation has gotten ahead of itself.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have to be clear, I remain bullish on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) over the long-term. This semiconductor producer rules atop the AI space, producing high-performance chips that drive the growth we’re seeing across the broader AI sector.\n\nHowever, with a stock price that has topped $625 per share and new price targets of $1,100, investors have to ask the question of whether this rally has been overdone. There’s simply too much excitement around this name driving an incredibly high valuation (Nvidia actually briefly topped Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in terms of market value this week). That alone speaks volumes about how incredible this stock’s recent rally has been.\n\nRisks also remain with the company’s business model. Despite a robust supply chain, Nvidia may struggle to meet future demand for AI chips, further triggering product price flare-ups. The anticipated H200 chips rollout in 2024 will further boost its advantageous business mix. However, everything depends on execution, and the fact that NVDA stock is priced to perfection doesn’t leave much room for any downside moving forward.\n\nOverall, I think Nvidia is a stock to own, not trade. At these levels, I’d consider trimming exposure, until the froth in the market abates. Yes, NVDA stock could head higher from here, but I think risks are skewed to the downside for now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Jared, let's start with what is catching your eye today after January's hotter than expected inflation report.\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Josh, it's all about the bond market. And I'm tracking the entire yield curve, which has shifted up. This middle line was where we were yesterday. This yellow line was where we were at the end of last year. And this purple line is where we are today.\n\nAnd when we get very quick movements upwards or downwards for that matter in the bond market, it can have ripple effects across the rest of the market. And let me just show you in the 10-year T note yield where we have come from. As you said, up 14 basis points today. That is a lot for risk markets to deal with.\n\nThis is a one-year chart. And late last year when we had that, everything rally, we went down significantly about 100 basis points there. But the net result this year is we are heading higher and this is creating more volatility.\n\nJust take a look at what the VIX did today. This is now at the highest level in months. And you scale this down to a five-day view, you can really see risk markets under the gun here. And we want to shift it over to Ines here who's trucking sector action.\n\nINES FERRE: Yeah, that's right, Jared. And taking a look at the sectors today, we saw all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 in the red today. So let's take a look here. We watched as rate-sensitive sectors have been the ones impacted the most.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou see XLY here down almost 2%, consumer discretionary. Remember that this includes names like Amazon, Tesla, Home Depot, McDonald's. When economic times are good people flocked to these companies. When they're bad, when they're not so good, they stay away.\n\nYou also are taking a look at XLRE, this is the real estate sector down almost 2% as well. Higher for longer rates impacting commercial real estate, expected to also impact residential real estate or at least keep it frozen. You're also seeing technology that's in the red.\n\nBut take a look at the sectors that lost the least. Defensive, meaning health care, the health care sector. And also the energy sector down almost 1% as today we saw WTI and Brent crude up more than 1%. And now with a closer look at tech, let's go to Madison Mills.\n\nMADISON MILLS: Yeah, Ines, you can't really talk about a big sell-off day like today without talking about where most of the market concentration still is in those Magnificent Seven stocks. Six of those seven doing exactly what you would expect in a sell-off day like today, down about between 1% and 3% depending on the name.\n\nThe one that's the least big loser among those seven is Nvidia and why is that? This is our AI play, right? It's continuing to get a lot of positive attention from investors.\n\nOne friend of the show on X calling it the only stock that could beat the Fed when the Fed was proven right today in that CPI print. And that's exactly what we're seeing after the close here-- as we come up on the close rather. It looks like Nvidia is going to end the day about flat and that is something that we saw in the market action throughout the day. Every time that Nvidia kind of went right into the red, we saw it correcting back into the green.\n\nI also spoke with Steve Sosnick about this name earlier today and he said that Nvidia is going to be critical to watch when it comes to earnings next week. We saw them beating across a lot of metrics in their last print, but that did not lead to positive market action for Nvidia. So that could continue to pour cold water across the markets. Josh and Julie, I want to go back to you in studio.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Maddie, thank you so much-- or should I say Maddie, Ines, and Jared, thank you so much for that full team coverage of the sell off that we're seeing today.",

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia was on the verge of overtaking Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company on Tuesday as the dominant AI chipmaker ended the day with a market capitalization above Amazon's for the first time in two decades.\n\nNvidia's shares slipped 0.17%, leaving its stock market value at $1.78 trillion, eclipsing Amazon's $1.75 trillion value after the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's stock declined 2.15%.\n\nGoogle-owner Alphabet's stock dipped 1.62%, leaving its market capitalization at $1.81 trillion.\n\nNvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build AI into their products and services, with its graphics processors in short supply as Meta Platforms and other Big Tech companies buy billions of dollars worth of its components.\n\nMizuho in a client note raised its price target for Nvidia's stock to $825 from $625 ahead of the Santa Clara, California, company's quarterly results due on Feb. 21. The stock ended Tuesday at $721.28.\n\nLead times for Nvidia's top-shelf H100 processor have declined, \"but overall demand far outstrips supply,\" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote, adding he sees \"substantial AI upside\" for Nvidia, Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia controls about 80% of the high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock up 46% this year after more than tripling in 2023. Technology-related companies, including Microsoft and Meta, have also rallied to record highs on AI optimism.\n\nAlphabet has put chatbot technology into its Google search engine while marketing generative AI tools to cloud customers. Its stock hit an all-time high a day before its quarterly report on Jan. 30 failed to meet investors' high expectations and sent its shares tumbling. Alphabet's stock remains up 4% in 2024.\n\nNvidia's market capitalization briefly overtook Amazon's on Monday, but Amazon was back on top by the end of that trading session.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe previous time Nvidia was more valuable than Amazon was in 2002, when they were each worth under $6 billion. By mid-2004, Nvidia's stock market value had tumbled to under $2 billion as Alphabet listed its shares at a valuation of $23 billion.\n\nAn early leader in the AI race, Microsoft in January overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company, now valued at over $3 trillion. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is the world's third most valuable publicly listed company, according to LSEG.\n\nWidely viewed as lagging in the AI race, Apple's stock has dropped 4% in 2024.\n\nSaudi Aramco has a $2 trillion market capitalization, although over 90% of it is closely held by the government of Saudi Arabia and less than 2% of its shares are available for trading by investors.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword in the stock market after companies specializing in the industry saw robust growth. Many corporations announced efforts to use AI and generative AI to increase their productivity and enhance their products.\n\nAI remains in its early innings. Its tools are showing up in more places, offering investors an attractive opportunity. Various AI tools need semiconductors to operate. Semiconductor firms have even offered chips exclusively for artificial intelligence tools.\n\nTherefore, investors looking to ride the AI rally may want to consider these top semiconductor stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an emerging leader in the AI industry that seems destined to be added to the S&P 500 index this year. Investors have bid up the stock by 700% over the past year as the company’s leading position in AI becomes more well-known.\n\nSupermicro produces servers that can handle the intense workload of AI tools. Rather than producing AI chips, Supermicro’s solutions complement these chips nicely.\n\nCorporations that want to tap into artificial intelligence will have to turn to companies like Supermicro. The firm has experienced heightened demand from its current customers and even more interest from new customers.\n\nSupermicro delivered an exceptional 103% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The stock is having its Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) moment which can get extended due to its low valuation and market cap.\n\nSMCI’s market cap is roughly $38 billion, and the equity trades at a 52 P/E ratio. Also, the stock has a 0.76 PEG ratio. A PEG ratio under one indicates that a stock is undervalued.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and software giant that has rewarded shareholders for many years. Between dividend growth, appreciation, and stock buybacks, Broadcom has outperformed most equities over the past five years. AVGO has had a 355% gain during that time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s Trident 5-X12 chip can lead to more market share and financial growth. This chip uses 25% less power per 400G port than the current market-leading Trident 4-X9. In other words, it is a more efficient chip that can help corporations that want to harness the power of AI. Broadcom delivers a wide portfolio of chips to address customers’ needs.\n\nAlso, the firm delivered good financials in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Broadcom announced 5% YOY revenue growth and 7.4% YOY net income growth in the report. And, the company’s net profit margin was 37.2%.\n\nTherefore, Broadcom’s industry strength and exposure to multiple growth opportunities make it an enticing pick for long-term investors.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is recovering after a few challenging quarters. The company wrapped up 2023 on a high note with 10% YOY revenue growth. Also, AMD rebounded from low profits in Q4 2022 by posting $667 million in net income during Q4 2023.\n\nThe equity has outperformed the stock market over the long run to the tune of a 628% gain over the past five years. Momentum remains strong with this stock based on its 112% gain over the past year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices can continue its ascent because of AI tailwinds. The semiconductor giant is prepared and has a portfolio of AI chips such as the Instinct MI300X Accelerators, Ryzen Processors and Radeon Graphics Cards.\n\nWhile Nvidia is the leader in the industry, AMD can gain market share and achieve meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. AMD has the potential to become a trillion-dollar stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI and AVGO.

        "content": "Big-name tech stocks posted strong earnings to start the year. But, if you missed the boat on Meta (NASDAQ:META) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), don’t lose hope. These tech stocks to buy now have plenty of room to run, and, in some cases, short-term news is putting undue downward pressure on share prices – offering an ideal entry opportunity for long-term investors looking for the next big thing.\n\nRanging from artificial intelligence, cloud computing, satellites, and more, these tech stocks to buy now could make up the next Magnificent 7 as their respective markets mature and they continue expanding at their current pace.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) easily tops the list of top tech stocks to buy now after its recent earnings strength, but remember that the tech stock isn’t a one-trick pony. In fact, the most recent quarterly report is the company’s fifth consecutive profitable quarter, affirming its S&P 500 eligibility. Remember that the S&P methodology requires four consecutive profitable quartersplus profitability for the most recent quarter, though that parameter doesn’t apply to incumbents.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, index inclusion aside, more bullish factors put Palantir at the top of the list of tech stocks to buy now. The biggest deal, and what drove bearish sentiment in the past, is Palantir’s accelerating commercial contract pipeline. In the past, concern centered around Palantir’s over-reliance on government contracting. That’s a valid consideration, but the company’s year-end commercial revenue grew 20% year-over-year (YoY), while government sales value climbed 14%. Though both top-line numbers point to strong momentum, commercial sales expansion points to Palantir successfully breaking free from its “defense stock” misconception.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Arista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSome top analysts see Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) as the “next big thing” for artificial intelligence, but, thus far, it’s been eclipsed by other big-name tech stocks competing for investor attention. But that could change in 2024.\n\nAnalysts, including those at Citi, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and more, rate Arista as a Buy based on future cloud sector expansion and AI opportunities. Specifically, Citi analyst Atif Malik said that Arita benefits from both the “generative AI megatrend” and broad “early AI-related opportunities.”\n\nThough the company hasn’t yet posted earnings, analyst forecasts trend toward the bullish side as well. Consensus estimates peg earnings per share at $1.70, or 20% higher YOY. The company’s last report beat expectations, with management painting a rosier-than-expected picture for Q4 and its end-of-year report. All eyes are on this tech stock to buy before its February 12th earnings call as AI investor sentiment cycles back to the “hard tech” side of the equation.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares suffered thus far in 2024 after a convertible note offering spooked investors wary of dilution. But the company’s 20% drop likely won’t last long – making today’s pricing entry point ideal among small-cap tech stocks. Most already know that the company secured a $515 million contract to launch and service select space assets, but wider institutional attention has only recently accelerated.\n\nSpecifically, like Arista, Citi analysts are bullish on RocketLab. The rating and analysis side of the banking giant set a Buy rating for the stock with a $6.00 price target, or about 40% above today’s per-share pricing. Citi set the target based on a 3x multiple of the company’s current sales projection, indicating that the substantial government contract is just the beginning of an expanding sales cycle as the company matures and proves competitive with existing space stocks. Small-cap tech stocks tend to have the best long-term upside potential at the cost of higher volatility, so getting in with RocketLab today is a surefire way to capture a slice of a $1 trillion growing industry.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nI talked last year about the investment opportunity that the Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and VMware merger represented from an equity arbitrage perspective. But, now that the deal is closed, there’s a tech stock opportunity in Broadcom now that VMware’s acquisition softens its reliance on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nHistorically, Apple accounts for about 20% of Broadcom’s revenue based on its ongoing 5G and wireless component deal. Expanding into cloud computing massively increases Broadcom’s total addressable market. Broadcom expects VMware integration to healthily boost its bottom line, although the first year also must account for about $1 billion in transaction costs that will cut into early-stage profitability. Still, a short-term hurdle is a small price to pay for long-term synergies, and Broadcom’s current per-share pricing (which has bearish undertones) positions it as a tech stock ready to surge once management fully divests unused VMware segments and begins working in sync with its new sectors.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) can’t stop its winning streak after announcing a new, secret deal with the U.S. government. While “announcing” and “secret” might seem counter to one another, the secretive nature of the deal surrounds what AST will provide and for how much. But swirling unknowns don’t impact the main message. Like RocketLab, the U.S. government throwing its hat in with ASTS is an important endorsement of the company’s viability and offerings. That endorsement rings especially loudly, considering ASTS is firmly in the pre-revenue stages, with its first widespread commercial launches planned for later this year.\n\nThe news comes, of course, on the heels of ASTS’ massive strategic funding deal that includes big-name investors like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). That deal was soon followed by a dilutive share offering announcement, sending shares close to penny stock territory. But, with all the bullish tailwinds propelling this small-cap tech stock forward, expect big things in 2024 for ASTS.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: SoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) seems to have finally found its spot between “pure” next-gen fintech and bigger-picture legacy banking. At the end of January, the cheap tech stock banked its first-ever profitable quarter at a slim two cents per share. But profit is profit, and the fact that SoFi successfully nailed its first in a “higher for longer” macroclimate means that the stock should surge as rates settle.\n\nUniquely, SoFi is now pivoting toward a wider range of offerings to cement its place as a one-stop financial services stock when coupled with its range of banking and borrowing solutions. SoFi recently announced that it now offers alternative investments within its investment platform, letting investors access otherwise off-limit assets like private credit and venture capital through managed funds.\n\nNot all are as bullish on SoFi’s future as recent developments would imply, though, as Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the stock based on “[SoFi] pricing in too much optimism on the path to 2026 profitability laid […] while staring in the face of a worsening top-line growth outlook for 2024.” But investors have plenty to justify optimism, and the tech stock is still priced to buy well below past highs.\n\nFabrinet (FN) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN), a small-cap semiconductor stock, is another tech stock positioned for massive upside in the coming years. The company counts Nvidia among its big-name client list, underscoring its long-term potential. Even as chipmakers battle for supremacy, Fabrinet’s focus on data transmission makes it a major supplier to the best-in-class semiconductor stocks. This helps shield it from company-specific risk while capturing the entire segment’s long-term upside.\n\nThough the company reported underwhelming earnings last week, management’s long-term outlook remains rosy. Executives project a slight bump for next quarter’s earnings, though its forecast remains slightly below past analyst expectations. Slowing growth in the short term means consolidation and accumulation opportunities for investors before tech stocks’ next leg up as the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors keep maturing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The Bull Case for NVDA Stock: How Nvidia Could Be Worth $1,600 by 2027",
        "content": "From a quantitative standpoint, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are a strongsell. The company scores an F in the MarketMasterAI stock-picking system, and my most recent February algorithm update only gives NVDA stock 3.5% upside over the next six months. Companies historically sell off after enormous run-ups, and Nvidia’s 400% rise since 2021 lands it squarely in that camp. Super-normal profits, after all, tend to attract unwanted competition.\n\nBut Nvidia is not a normal company. The company has a commanding first-mover advantage in AI accelerator chips, a product that’s seen insatiable demand from cloud computing providers. The Silicon Valley-based firm has been lucky; Nvidia’s decision to remain a fabless producer (i.e. outsourcing production to others) only worked because its primary partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) proved to be so capable. And Nvidia’s management had the uncommon foresight to keep its GPU software proprietary, essentially locking in developers.\n\nTogether, that’s created a computing behemoth that even the best quantitative algorithms cannot fully comprehend. A bull case for a $1,600 price target for Nvidia is emerging. And here’s why it can realistically happen.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia’s Path to $1,600 Per Share: CUDA Software\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Nvidia began developing CUDA, a software platform designed to run multiple processors in parallel. The goal was to create a solution for general computing on graphic processing units (GPUs) — essentially a way for ordinary programs to interact with these new chips.\n\nThese efforts were wildly successful.\n\nSince then, CUDA has become the standard software for everything from computer games to AI training. The ecosystem includes entire libraries, optimizing tools, a compiler, and a runtime library to deploy applications. MarketMasterAI uses these tools to run on Nvidia’s GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, the business side of CUDA has been even more notable. The system remains a closed-source platform, creating a lock-in effect to Nvidia’s GPUs. Any code optimized for Nvidia’s products must be rewritten to run on other systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s created a formidable barrier to entry. Data centers running on Nvidia’s GPUs have high switching costs to move systems. Even if Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) or Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) develops a strong competitor to Nvidia’s H100, the costs of moving to AMD’s ROCm platform will dissuade many from making the switch. In other words, Nvidia’s GPUs will remain the gold standard for AI model training for the foreseeable future.\n\nThese facts are virtually impossible for quantitative systems to detect. All an algorithm sees is a company whose growth is expected to slow in the coming years; Wall Street expects Nvidia’s net profit growth to slow to 70% in 2025 and then decline to 17.5% in 2026.\n\nBut the economics are clear: Nvidia’s fabless business model and high lock-in effects create immense profits from a tiny capital base. Analysts estimate the chipmaker’s returns on capital invested (ROIC) will expand from 100% today to 185% by 2026, helping Nvidia generate $66 billion of annual free cash flow. Even if Nvidia’s ROIC falls a third by 2046, a 3-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model still values Nvidia at $1,600 a share, 140% upside. As analysts at Morningstar note, “Nvidia dominates AI today and the sky is the limit for the company’s profitability if it can maintain this lead over the next decade.”\n\nThe Risks to Nvidia\n\nHowever, Nvidia’s $1,600 price target comes with significant risks.\n\nCompetition. The greatest concern is that one (or more) competitor releases a solid alternative to Nvidia and its CUDA software. We’re already seeing some strong contenders. In December, AMD launched the MI300, a 3D chip that supposedly runs 20%-40% faster than Nvidia’s flagship H100s. Intel could soon launch rival systems of its own. Growth. Nvidia has faced unexpectedly stiff challengers in autonomous driving from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and others. Automakers have also been wary of locking themselves into a single computing standard. That means most of Nvidia’s growth will come from AI training — leaving all its eggs in a single basket. Cyclical Demand. Data centers and gaming are historically boom-bust industries, with years of super-normal growth punctuated by sudden slowdowns. Though Nvidia’s asset-light model protects the company from financial issues, the sudden evaporation of demand will set the firm’s profits back several years.\n\nTogether, that means Nvidia’s free cash flow could decline from 2027 onwards. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plan to launch in-house GPUs in the coming years, and merely the threat of these new entrants could force Nvidia to reduce prices and accept lower margins. Re-running a 3-stage DCF model with more conservative assumptions reduces its fair value to $320. (This assumes ROIC drops to 28% and growth to 3.3% by 2047).\n\nNvidia’s $1,600 price target also assumes that the company will be able to achieve 21% average growth through 2046 and maintain high returns on capital. This will become increasingly difficult as cloud computing demand shifts from building new AI capacity to replacing existing servers.\n\nWe’re already seeing the limits to Nvidia’s growth. In 2023, the firm returned $9.6 billion of its cash to investors after finding nowhere else to invest it. And only time will tell whether this is the start of a more worrying trend.\n\nShould You Buy Nvidia Stock?\n\nThe problem with valuing a company like Nvidia is that most of its cash flows are far into the future. Only 8% of Nvidia’s current market capitalization is explained by cash flow over the next three years, while the next 20 years explain 33% of Nvidia’s value. The remaining 63% of Nvdia’s value sits beyond 2046. By comparison, cash-generating Qualcomm will justify almost 20% of its value in the next 3 years.\n\nThat means tiny changes in today’s assumptions will have outsized impacts on Nvidia’s justified value. Increasing growth rates by just 1% annually from 2027 onwards raises Nvidia’s fair value by 14.5%, all else equal. Shrinking growth by 1% cuts 12.2% from its market capitalization… more than the entire market capitalization of Intel. That makes an investment in Nvidia riskier than people might expect… which is why MarketMasterAI could be right about the company’s chances over the next six months.\n\nNevertheless, Nvidia has surprised investors before. The company remains the only notable player in AI training. And if its competitors fail to launch compelling alternatives, investors can expect Nvidia to keep rising from here. After all, the sky’s the limit when it comes to AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held a LONG position in GOOG and GOOGL.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best robotics stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the robotics industry, head directly to 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nIn 2023, the global robotics market was valued at $46.0 billion. IMARC Group anticipates substantial growth, projecting the market to reach $169.8 billion by 2032. This forecast indicates a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during the period from 2024 to 2032. The robotics market's expansion is attributed to significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a surge in demand for automation due to increasing labor shortages and rising labor costs, government initiatives and funding, and the expanding application areas of robotics.\n\nThe adoption of robotics has, in fact, doubled in the last six years, setting the stage for further acceleration. According to a 2022 report by the International Federation of Robotics, at least 3.5 million industrial robots were operational in manufacturing factories worldwide as of 2021, and industrial robot installations reached an all-time high. The investment in industrial robots has been on an upward trajectory since 2010, driven by manufacturers aiming to reduce production costs. Recent developments indicate that the impact of robotics is poised to extend beyond manufacturing into different industries. Notably, in the health sciences and wellness sector, robots are increasingly being deployed in operating rooms, clinical settings, and research laboratories to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks. With evolving technologies, robots are expected to operate more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own.\n\nThe high capital expenditure and retraining costs associated with automation through robotics have historically limited efficiency gains to larger companies. However, this scenario is changing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The average price of an industrial robot has decreased by half over the last decade, dropping from $47,000 in 2011 to approximately $23,000 in 2022. Forecasts by ARK Invest suggest a further 50% to 60% reduction in costs by 2025. Moreover, new business models, such as robotics-as-a-service, are enhancing accessibility by mitigating upfront capex costs through lease agreements.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe past five years, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, have underscored the vulnerability of globalized supply chains, especially for businesses relying on intricate components like semiconductors. In response, a significant number of European (74%) and US (70%) businesses intend to reshore or nearshore their operations, as indicated by a 2022 survey by ABB Robotics. A substantial portion of these businesses (75% in Europe and 62% in the US) plan to invest in robotic automation within the next three years. Legislative acts like the US CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act further signify the trend toward reshoring manufacturing, either through incentives or mandates. Amid widely reported labor shortages, particularly in manufacturing, there is a clear opportunity for automation and robotics. China, aggressively pursuing robotics in the last decade, surpassed the US in technology adoption in 2021, illustrating the impact of this trend.\n\nBill Gates discussed some groundbreaking robotics initiatives in a GatesNotes blog post at the beginning of 2024. The Microsoft co-founder considers developing machines that mimic human body functions, such as walking, jumping, touching, and gripping objects, to be a greater challenge than advancing artificial intelligence, which already demonstrates daily progress. Gates highlighted his enthusiasm for five robotics startups, starting with Agility Robotics, an American startup that has developed a human-centric, multipurpose robot tailored for logistics work. This robot, approximately the size of a human, can handle heavy loads and express \"emotions\" through LEDs on its face, enhancing interaction with human colleagues. Another notable initiative is from Tevel, an Israeli startup deploying autonomous flying robots for continuous selective fruit picking, ensuring ripe apples are harvested around the clock. Gates also mentioned Apptronik, whose robots have the potential to assist astronauts on Moon or Mars missions. Gates also praised the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) at UCLA for its robot capable of navigating rocky, unstable terrain without falling. Lastly, he acknowledged Field AI, a company developing AI-powered software for robots, enabling complete autonomy in various missions. Gates envisions robots, including humanoid models, playing crucial roles in responding to future natural disasters or major health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic. They could manually weed on farms, carry heavy loads in factories, and become essential in healthcare, hospitality, and household settings.\n\nTo benefit from the growth potential in the robotics industry, some of the best stocks to invest in include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The company gave a weak outlook as a major customer slowed its 3-nanometer technology transition. The Fund sold the stock.”\n\n11. Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nStryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) is a medical technology company operating in two segments – MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Orthopaedics and Spine.

Stryker is a large diversified medical device company with two business segments: (1) MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and (2) Orthopedics and Spine. The stock sold off during the quarter along with many other medical device stocks because of concerns about the impact of GLP-1 weight loss medicines on their business. Specific to Stryker, the concern was that weight loss would reduce demand for hip and knee implant procedures because obesity is one factor that drives osteoarthritis. We think this concern was overstated and saw the sell-off as an opportunity to buy a high-quality growth company at a reasonable valuation. We think Stryker is well positioned with its broad product portfolio to benefit from the trend of more orthopedic and other medical procedures moving from the hospital to ambulatory surgery centers. The company also has several new product launches coming up that should drive growth. At its recent Investor Day, management provided long-term financial goals including organic sales growth at the high end of the medical technology industry and double-digit EPS growth.”\n\n10.

Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power.

We had previously owned United Technologies and were impressed with their CEO, Greg Hayes, now the CEO of RTX. The opportunity to purchase RTX came after the company disclosed a problem with an engine component that will result in a significant charge to inspect and replace. This is a fixable issue requiring time and money, but we believe the price decline provided a good opportunity to start a position in this highly profitable, well-managed company.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds 11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon 12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None. 14 Best Robotics Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Palantir Joined Amazon And Microsoft In Showing That AI Already Lived Up To The Hype",
        "content": "Although much of the AI buzz has been somewhat saved for the magnificent seven, which are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), there are other companies successfully riding the wave. Last week, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) reported its fourth quarter earnings and it topped estimates fueled by AI demand that continues to be unrelenting in the U.S.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Palantir reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $608.4 million, topping LSEG’s estimate of $602.4 million. Net income grew from $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share Palantir earned in 2022’s comparable quarter to $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of 8 cents were in line with LSEG’s estimate.\n\nHeavy Reliance On Government Deals Is No Longer An Issue\n\nPalantir reported its customer base grew 35% YoY to 497 customers it served during the fourth quarter, showing it is enjoying a surging demand in the private sector whose customer count rose 44% annually. Therefore, Palantir showed it is successfully building its business outside its legacy government sector. What’s even more impressive is that Palantir used a low-cost mechanism to get customers into its pipeline.\n\nCustomer Acquisition At Its Finest\n\nWhile Microsoft infused billions into OpenAI, with Amazon and Alphabet following suit by investing into Antrophic, Palantir tried to stand out with a unique lead generation strategy. By hosting almost 600 immersive seminars that it calls \"boot camps”, Palantir aimed to fuel interest in its AI platform as it gives attendees the opportunity to try out its software and understand the value of Palantir’s contribution in generative AI-drive use cases. In 2023 alone, Palantir successfully hosted over 500 of those boot camps with growth of its private sector software users showing they did a good job of luring them in.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Operates In The Shadows Of Big Tech But It Won Its Place Fair And Square\n\nPalantir has delivered when it comes to profitability and it passed the test of consistency. Although its market cap of only $51 billion doesn’t place it in the basket tech mammoths like Microsoft, its latest jaw-dropping report had no shortage of impressive key performance indicators that sent its stock to the Moon as it rocketed by roughly 50% over the five trading days that followed its latest report. Like Microsoft and Amazon, Palantir showed what AI can do for business with expanding margins flowing to the bottom line, along with compounding cash flow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Nvidia Overtakes Amazon in Market Value: ETFs to Tap",
        "content": "Nvidia NVDA experienced a record-breaking surge fueled by an artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy and analysts’ bullish view. After the biggest monthly increase ever in market value in January, the chipmaker overtook Amazon AMZN at $1.78 trillion and became the fourth-most valuable company in the United States.\r\n\r\nInvestors can tap the strength with the help of ETFs having the largest allocation to Nvidia. These include VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, AXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF WUGI, Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, MeetKevin Pricing Power ETF PP and Pacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF TRFK.\r\n\r\nNvidia stock has risen about 47% so far in 2024 and is by far the biggest outperformer among the so-called “Magnificent Seven.”\n\nAI Boom\n\nA key factor driving the surge is Nvidia's dominant position in the AI sector. The world’s largest chipmaker continues to benefit from the explosive demand for its cutting-edge chips used in AI applications, which are used to power ChatGPT and many similar services. It is boosting supply to meet surging demand. Nvidia's chips are used in applications ranging from robotics and the metaverse to medical imaging and video analytics (read: Should You Buy Nvidia After Its Huge Run? ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nIn January, the premier AI chip manufacturer announced the launch of new GeForce graphic processors for AI-equipped laptops and PCs at CES. It also revealed that its automated driving system is being adopted in electric vehicles, with Li Auto and other EV companies integrating Nvidia Drive Thor into their fleets.\n\nAnalysts Bullish View\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.23 a month ago based on 37 recommendations.\r\n\r\nOf the 39 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.18% and 5.13% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 83.78%, while Buy represented 8.11%.\r\n\r\nMost of the analysts raised the price target on Nvidia ahead of its quarterly earnings release on Feb 21, which is expected to come in stronger than expected. Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $750, while Goldman and Bank of America hiked the price target to $800. Meanwhile, Melius Research boosted the price target for Nvidia even higher to $920 from $750. Based on short-term price targets offered by 37 analysts, the average price target for Nvidia comes to $675.52. The forecasts range from a low of $410.00 to a high of $1,100.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Surprise in the Cards?\n\nNvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of +5.26%. According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThis largest chipmaker saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. Nvidia is expected to post massive earnings and revenue growth of 412.5% and 233.52%, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nFurther, Nvidia has a top Growth Score of A, indicating it has strong growth prospects despite the fact the stock is trading at a higher P/E ratio of 35.62 versus 26.52 for the industry.\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nLet’s delve into each ETF below:\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment. It follows the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which tracks the most liquid companies in the industry based on market capitalization and trading volume. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF holds 26 stocks in its basket, with Nvidia occupying the top position at 24.5%. \r\n\r\nVanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has managed assets worth $14.2 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. SMH is heavily traded with a volume of 7 million shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 with a High risk outlook (read: 5 Sector ETFs Beating the Market Halfway Through Q1).\r\n\r\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF (WUGI)\r\n\r\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF is an actively managed ETF that invests in stocks of companies that benefit from the ever-evolving digital economy. It holds 33 stocks in the basket, with Nvidia occupying the top position at 18.9%.\r\n\r\nAXS Esoterica NextG Economy ETF has accumulated $29.1 million in its asset base and charges 75 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 2,000 shares.\r\n\r\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ)\r\n\r\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF follows the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index, which seeks investment in companies that stand to benefit from the increased adoption and utilization of robotics and AI, including those involved in industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots and autonomous vehicles.\r\n\r\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has 42 stocks in its basket, with Nvidia occupying the top spot with a 19.9% share. The ETF has AUM of $2.4 billion and an average daily volume of 1.2 million shares. It charges 69 bps in annual fees.\r\n\r\nMeetKevin Pricing Power ETF (PP)\r\n\r\nMeetKevin Pricing Power ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in U.S.-listed equity securities of Innovative Companies, which, in Kevin’s view, have more “pricing power” than their peers. The fund holds a small basket of 16 stocks, with Nvidia occupying the third position at 14.3%.\r\n\r\nMeetKevin Pricing Power ETF has accumulated $41.5 million in its asset base. It charges 77 bps in annual fees and trades in a lower volume of 12,000 shares a day on average.\r\n\r\nPacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF (TRFK)\r\n\r\nPacer Data and Digital Revolution ETF aims to offer investors exposure to the globally listed stocks and depositary receipts of data and digital revolution companies.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Arm Holdings Plc was already one of world’s most expensive stocks for its size heading into last week’s earnings report. After three days of manic share buying, it’s now in a league of its own.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Says Putin Can’t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill Trump Asks Supreme Court to Keep DC Election Trial on Hold Putin Seeks Revenge on a World Order He Once Wanted to Join Wall Street Roiled by ‘Still Sticky’ CPI Signals: Markets Wrap\n\nThe stock is priced at 38 times revenue projected over the next 12 months, after jumping more than 90% since the chip designer gave a bullish sales forecast that it attributed in part to artificial intelligence spending. That’s far more expensive than any stock in the Nasdaq 100 or the S&P 500, including Nvidia Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock fell about 10% on Tuesday, but it is coming off a four-day surge of more than 100%.\n\nThe magnitude of the rally in Arm’s shares — to now nearly triple the IPO price — has captivated traders, who have watched the stock add the equivalent of PayPal Holdings Inc.’s market value in the past three days. Despite the rapid gains, the surge doesn’t appear to be driven by short covering with bets against the stock weighing in at just 1% of shares available to trade, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.\n\nArm designs semiconductors used in a wide range of products including smartphones, cars, televisions and appliances. The company is benefiting from a corporate scramble to add artificial intelligence technology, which promises to accelerate Arm’s expansion, Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas said last week. The U.K.-based company forecast sales of $850 million to $900 million in the current quarter, far surpassing analyst estimates.\n\nUp until recently, the AI chip story has been confined to the accelerator market — chips used to train large language models that underpin generative AI services like ChatGPT. That portion of the industry is dominated by Nvidia with Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. seen as having a chance to cash in on the gold rush.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther chipmakers including Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. have argued that for AI to become a mainstream technology, it has to make it on to end-user devices like personal computers and smartphones. But they’ve been able to show few benefits to their finances, yet.\n\nArm is the first to back up that assertion with numbers. That’s most notable in its licensing division where it showed that more companies are planning on using its technology to build chips to support their AI ambitions.\n\nDespite the promise, the stock has risen so far that it’s left even bullish investors concerned that its gains are out of touch with fundamentals. On Feb. 9, Banco Santander analyst Carlos Trevino cut his rating on Arm to the equivalent of sell from buy, citing the difficulty in justifying such a move.\n\nConsider Arm’s revenue growth projections relative to Nvidia’s. Wall Street estimates call for Arm’s sales to rise 23% in the fiscal year that ends in March 2025. Nvidia is expected to see sales jump 60% in its fiscal year that ends in January 2025. That stock is half as expensive as Arm, with a price to estimated sales of about 19 times.\n\nRead more: Arm Extends Blistering Rally as Stock Nearly Triples Since IPO\n\n“In momentum markets you often see people going after certain names, which get started going and then keep going and going,” said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. “You can worry about valuation and extrapolate what would have to happen for the valuation to be justified, but the market can make you look stupid by continuing to go up.”\n\nOn Monday, the company attracted its highest call volume on record, with investors bidding up the cost of short-dated calls — signaling continued demand for upside exposure.\n\nOn Wall Street, analysts are mostly bullish. Of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 18 have buy ratings and just three say sell. The average price target sits around $90, which implies a decline of 39% from the stock’s $148.97 closing price on Monday.\n\nSuch a drop would not surprise Dennis Dick, head trader at Triple D Trading, even though he notes that momentum can continue to carry the stock higher.\n\n“When stocks are being driven by a story - and this is being driven by the AI story - the valuation takes a backseat,” he said.\n\n“Speculative investors will pay anything, but when valuation matters again, what you’ll have is a gap between what speculative investors and what value or even growth investors are willing to pay. When this stops, there will be no one to sell to.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nAs big tech stocks continue to rally, the battle for the world’s third most-valuable publicly-listed company is heating up between Saudi Arabian Oil Co., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia. The cohort only trails fellow mega-caps Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. The next catalyst comes when Nvidia reports earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nOpenAI’s Sam Altman said the United Arab Emirates could serve as the world’s “regulatory sandbox” to test artificial intelligence technologies and later spearhead global rules limiting their use. Elon Musk’s X is adding new advertiser targeting features to better entice video creators and compete against YouTube. Sony Group Corp. may report the PlayStation 5’s strongest holiday quarter yet on Wednesday, helped by the blockbuster release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 and the launch of a slimmer and lighter version of the console. An Ohio federal judge granted a tech industry group Netchoice’s request to block enforcement of a state law that would require online platforms to identify would-be users under age 16 and obtain parental consent.

The strength, along with the insatiable demand for its accelerators that power AI tasks, led UBS Group AG and Mizuho Securities to follow counterparts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in boosting price targets ahead of the company’s earnings results due Feb. 21.\n\nThis week, UBS lifted its target to $850 from $580, and also increased its estimates for earnings per share. Meanwhile, Mizuho raised its target to $825 from $625. Demand for Nvidia’s H100 AI accelerators continues to outstrip supply, Mizuho’s Vijay Rakesh wrote in a client note, calling the stock the best AI play.\n\nThe stock of the Santa Clara, California-based company, the top performer on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes this year, has become one of the most-loved equities on Wall Street.

Wall Street’s average 12-month price target of about $690 is some 4.5% below Monday’s close.\n\nNvidia was down about 2% in early trading Tuesday, sinking along with other big-tech stocks after a report showed US consumer prices rose last month by more than forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates shares in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan I Hire My Crush?

        "title": "12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best autonomous driving stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of autonomous driving and how it's one of the most important sectors today especially when we consider the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe biggest trend in the stock market these days is artificial intelligence. While data science has been an industry for years, artificial intelligence has come to the public's attention only because of OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT. Before ChatGPT became available for public use, data science was primarily used in industrial cases such as supply chain management, drug and vaccine development, fraud detection, and others.\n\nAnother application that relies heavily on data science is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving is the technology that relies on a computer to aid a driver while they're on the road, and the industry has been able to progress quite a bit over the past couple of years. In fact, the same drivers of the A.I. wave, i.e. semiconductors designed and sold by firms such as NVIDIA Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), are also behind the rapid progress of autonomous driving systems.\n\nThese systems are made by public and private companies, and the former are traded on the stock markets as autonomous driving stocks. Autonomous driving stocks are those companies whose hardware or software is present in autonomous driving systems, or whose business operations are indispensable to the functioning of the autonomous driving industry. The potential of car makers to continuously gather data from every vehicle as it is being driven and then use this data to train algorithms that are capable of making driving decisions on their own has proven to be quite beneficial to autonomous driving stocks.\n\nIn fact, the world's most valuable car maker in terms of market capitalization, the Austin, Texas based electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) owes, some, if not most, of its market value to the simple fact that the firm's first principles driven approach led by its chief Elon Musk has enabled it to also operate as a technology company. This has made Tesla the world's most valuable autonomous driving stock, and the firm's massive market capitalization of $588 billion is based on its production systems and the massive amounts of data it has at its disposal to train its autonomous driving product, the Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while Tesla's FSD continues to remain functional and operational despite the daily dose of controversy surrounding it, 2024 has also seen some other autonomous driving stocks struggle. One such autonomous driving stock is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), whose Cruise autonomous driving system underwent a tragic accident in October last year that led California to pull its permits. Since then, a crucial GM update provided in January 2024 has created uncertainty about Cruise's future, and some quarters worry whether it will be able to regain compliance by the end of this year, especially after having laid off 25% of its workforce.\n\nSince Tesla's FSD is in a world of its own, its rivals such as GM compete with each other. Another mega cap stock that is also an autonomous driving stock is none other than the consumer technology behemoth Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now structured as a holding company that makes money from or funds the losses of a variety of lucrative business, one such Alphabet division is Waymo. When it comes to California, Waymoe and Cruise account for 99% of the test driving miles in 2023. And now, as Cruise's future becomes uncertain, Waymo has the 'road clear' when it comes to develop autonomous driving technologies.\n\nAs for Cruise, here is what General Motors had to say during the firm's latest earnings call:\n\nOur plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value.\n\nYou’ll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we’ve done, not just tell you what we’re going to do.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best autonomous driving stocks to buy. Some top autonomous driving stocks are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 12 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy Now\n\nAn auto warehouse filled with newly acquired used cars.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy, we ranked the top 20 autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023.

        "title": "ROKU Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?",
        "content": "Roku ROKU is set to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 15.\r\n\r\nFor fourth-quarter 2023, Roku expects total net revenues of $955 million, total gross profit of $405 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $10 million.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $959.66 million, indicating 10.68% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss per share has remained unchanged at 65 cents per share in the past 30 days. The figure suggests growth of 61.76% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same in one, the average earnings surprise being 9.67%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.\n\nRoku, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Roku, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nRoku, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Roku, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nRoku’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from the growing popularity of The Roku Channel, expanding TV brands & retailer partner base and third-party streaming channels.\r\n\r\nRoku has become the No. 1 TV streaming platform by hours streamed in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Globally, users streamed a record of 26.7 billion hours in the third quarter, up 1.6 billion hours from the prior quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the to-be-reported quarter, Roku unveiled two fresh additions to the Roku Home Screen, such as All Things Food and All Things Home. These new destinations bring together top-notch food, home and lifestyle content from various sources on the platform, creating seamless and engaging discovery experiences.\r\n\r\nBoth All Things Food and All Things Home will showcase a diverse array of streaming options within their respective categories, encompassing free and subscription-based services, live and linear TV, Premium Subscriptions, Roku Originals and more.\r\n\r\nThese new features are expected to have boosted streaming hours as well as platform revenues in the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for streaming hours is pegged at 28.44 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nActive account net adds were 2.3 million in the third quarter, taking the total active accounts to 75.8 million globally, representing greater engagement in Roku TV and more monetization opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for active accounts is pegged at 79 million, indicating growth of 12.9% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, supply chain issues are causing disruptions in its player unit sales in terms of shipping delays, product availability issues and product price increases.\r\n\r\nBoth consumers and advertisers have significantly curtailed spending due to inflation and recessionary fear, which is expected to have negatively impacted the company’s earnings for the quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the third quarter, the average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 7% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $41.03 (on a trailing 12-month basis). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARPU is pegged at $39.98, indicating a decline of 4.1% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Our Model Indicates\n\nOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for ROKU this time around.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",
        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Nvidia (NVDA)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 32.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $746.11 in the previous session. Nvidia has gained 45.9% since the start of the year compared to the 9.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 32% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 21, 2023, Nvidia reported EPS of $4.02 versus consensus estimate of $3.36 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 11.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $20.25 per share on $59 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $23.18 per share on $91.26 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 64.37% and 54.69%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nNvidia may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nNvidia has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 35.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 26.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 232.2X versus its peer group's average of 17.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.64. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Nvidia meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Nvidia shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We further our partnership with Intel Foundry through a strategic multiyear agreement on providing design software and leading IP at multiple Intel advanced nodes, thereby advancing Intel's IDM 2.0 strategy and accelerating mutual customer success. Cadence is at the forefront of the AI revolution, closely partnering with marquee companies on their trailblazing AI design for training and inference from cloud to the edge.\r\nNVIDIA and Cadence have collaborated closely over several years. And in Q4, we deepened our partnership through a meaningful expansion of our hardware solutions and EDA software. Earlier in the quarter, we announced our work on Cadence.AI with NVIDIA's NeMo Retriever. And now we are thrilled to deepen our partnership and extend it to the new Millennium, multiphysics supercomputer and SaaS solution, which is co-optimized with NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI platform.\r\nAnd as the exclusive EDA partner of Arm Total Design, Cadence and Arm are closely collaborating to accelerate the development of custom SoCs, based on the Neoverse Compute Subsystem.\r\nOver the year, we have continued building out our generated Cadence.AI portfolio. The industry's broadest AI offering spanning chip, to board, to system and delivering exceptional optimization and productivity benefits. Earlier in Q2, we introduced Virtuoso Studio, an Allegro X AI bringing AI to custom analog and PCB designs. And in Q4, we added Voltus InsightAI for automatically addressing voltage drop violations. We also pioneered bringing LLM capabilities to chip design, successfully helping Renesas accelerate functional specification to final design. Accelerating momentum of our Cadence.AI portfolio has led to an almost tenfold increase in the number of customers adopting our Gen AI solutions in 2023, as customers embrace the technology to develop optimized products much more efficiently.\r\nNow let's talk about some of the product highlights for Q4 and 2023. Rising system complexity and challenges stemming from the growing hyper-convergences of the electrical, mechanical and physical worlds, are driving the need for a seamless platform solution across design, packaging, simulation and analysis. We made this a core tenet of our Intelligent System Design growth strategy 6 years ago and our System Design & Analysis business continued its strong momentum delivering 18% year-over-year growth in Q4 and 22% growth for the year.\r\nPCB and advanced packaging are linchpin technologies that sit at the crucial intersection of mechanical and electrical domains and Cadence's rich heritage in these areas remain a key strategic differentiator, especially in the emerging chiplet era. We continue advancing these technologies with Allegro X AI providing greater than 10x acceleration in PCB design and endorsed by Schneider Electric and Kioxia at its launch. Our multiphysics analysis portfolio couples our expertise in physics-based modeling with AI-driven optimization and is delivering superior results to customers across multiple vertical segments, especially aerospace and defense and automotive.\r\nRecently, we launched Celsius Studios, the industry's first complete AI thermal design and analysis solutions for electronic systems, delivering up to a 10x performance benefit over legacy systems with endorsement by Samsung and BAE Systems.

Our digital software is proliferating in all top 20 semiconductor companies and our digital full flow was adopted by 34 additional customers during the year. We are very pleased with the accelerating momentum of our flagship Cadence Cerebrus Gen AI solution, whose transformative PPA and productivity benefits have led to its deployment in all our top 10 digital customers and used in well over 300 tape-outs.\r\nIn Q4, Cadence Cerebrus run rate more than quadrupled at several market-shaping customers, and it also drove significant digital full flow expansions at 2 top-tier semi customers. Our Integrity 3D-IC Platform is the industry's only unified 3D-IC design and analysis platform and ties our best-in-class SoC and package design technologies with system-level planning and analysis. In Q4, GUC successfully used integrity to tape-out a complex 3D stacked die design, with a wafer-on-wafer structure on an advanced FinFET node.\r\nNext, I will talk about our Functional Verification business, which had another remarkable year. delivering 11% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 and 22% growth for the full year. Escalating system and software bring-up challenges along with pressing need for first-pass silicon success continued driving strong demand for our functional verification solutions. Our best-in-class dynamic duo of Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platform delivered another record year with strong momentum across AI, hyperscale, auto and mobile.\r\nVirtually all of the top hyperscalers are Palladium customers, and the majority of them are also dynamic duo customers. Last month, we announced a new set of Palladium Z2 applications that included the industry's first 4 state emulation and mixed-signal modeling capabilities that will significantly accelerate SoC verification, marquee customers, including NVIDIA and Samsung supported the announcement.\r\nOur hardware family added 26 new and over 110 repeat customers during the year with the top 3 deals being with a global marquee system company, the leading AI system company, and the leading communication services company. Demand for the Dual have greatly exceeded our expectations when more than 2/3 of the orders in the year, including both platforms. Our custom IC Virtuoso inspective franchise solutions tackle the most complex challenges in analog, mixed signal, RF design and circuit simulation and are increasingly crucial for our customers. Building on our market leadership, our custom IC revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q4.\r\nCustomer interest in our recently announced Virtuoso Studio is strong with over 2,000 downloads so far and adoption of our newer Spectre platform products continues to ramp. Virtuoso had a major win with a top global memory company, which replaced its internal tools with our technology. Our IP business drove a strong finish to the year, growing 36% year-over-year in Q4. We continue to sharpen our Star IP strategy with a targeted acquisition such as Rambus PHY IP and Invecas to capture market opportunities offered by AI and heterogeneous integration. Customer interest in the Rambus PHY assets, especially HBM and GDDR IP have been extremely positive, which have already been instrumental in closing some strategic deals. Our Invecas acquisition is also highly synergistic to the strategy, adding a skilled engineering team with expertise in delivering custom solutions across design, product engineering, advanced packaging and embedded software.\r\nIn closing, we are pleased with our outstanding performance in 2023 and are excited by the business momentum and market opportunities in 2024. Now I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2024 outlook.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nThanks, Anirudh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Cadence delivered a strong Q4 and 2023, driven by growth across all of our businesses. Robust design activity and customer demand coupled with our strong execution helped us to achieve revenue growth of 15% and EPS growth of over 20% for the year. Fourth quarter bookings were strong, and I'm pleased that we achieved record backlog and record current remaining performance obligation levels, finishing the year with approximately $6.0 billion in backlog and at approximately $3.2 billion in cRPO.\r\nHere are some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Total revenue was $1.069 billion for the quarter, and $4.090 billion for the year. GAAP operating margin was 31.5% for the quarter and 30.6% for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 42.9% for the quarter and 42.0% for the year. GAAP EPS was $1.19 for the quarter and $3.82 for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.38 for the quarter and $5.15 for the year.\r\nNext, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at year-end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $650 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $272 million and $1.35 billion for the full year. DSOs were 43 days, and we used $700 million to repurchase Cadence shares during the year.\r\nBefore I provide our outlook for Q1 and 2024, I'd like to share some assumptions that are embedded in our outlook. In 2023, our upfront revenue mix increased to approximately 16%, largely due to strong hardware demand. In 2024, we expect another record hardware revenue year and strong IP growth. And as a result, at the midpoint, our outlook assumes that our upfront revenue mix for the year will increase to approximately 17.5%.\r\nIn Q1 2023, our upfront revenue mix was approximately 20%, largely due to our effort to improve hardware delivery lead times at the start of last year. In Q1 2024, at the midpoint, our outlook assumes an upfront revenue mix of approximately 14%. Our non-GAAP EPS outlook is based on a tax rate of 16.5%. And finally, our outlook for Q1 and 2024 is based on our usual assumption that export control regulations in place today remain substantially similar for the remainder of the year.\r\nIn our outlook for 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $4.55 billion to $4.61 billion. GAAP operating margin in the range of 32% to 33%; non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%, GAAP EPS in the range of $4.08 to $4.18; non-GAAP EPS in the range of $5.87 to $5.97. Operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, and we expect to use approximately 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase Cadence shares in 2024.\r\nFor Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 36.5% to 37.5%. GAAP EPS in the range of $0.74 to $0.78, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.14. And as usual, we published a CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.\r\nIn conclusion, I am pleased that for 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 15% and EPS growth of over 20%. We achieved the 7th consecutive year of over 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margins, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 42%. And we finished the year with record backlog and cRPO setting ourselves up for a great 2024. As always, I'd like to thank our customers, partners and our employees for their continued support.\r\nAnd with that, operator, we will now take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJason Vincent Celino\n\nHappy Monday. So maybe my first question on the backlog strength, really impressive, especially given the hard year-over-year comp. John and Anirudh, what drove the strength here? It sounds like its hardware related or maybe it's broad based. Anything helpful?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nJason, yes, it's very broad-based, broad-based across geographies and broad-based across all of the businesses. Actually, on the hardware front, you might recall this time last year, we finished with over 6 months of backlog for hardware. We addressed those lead times at the start of the year. And now we're down to a more normal 8 weeks of hardware backlog. So when you compare the backlog at the end of '23 against the end of '22, I think it reflects strong bookings, broad-based bookings across all geographies, across all businesses. But on the hardware side, slightly less hardware or maybe less hardware, certainly in backlog at the end of '23 versus the end of '22.\n\nJason Vincent Celino\n\nOkay. And then when we think about 2024 as a whole, is it a big renewal year? Or I guess, how does 2024 look compared to other years particularly '23, when you think about renewal timing and things like that?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. Great question, Jason, that's a -- last year was kind of very heavily weighted towards the second half for renewals. We don't expect it to be that heavily weighted in the second half of this year. Looking at software renewals and when they come due, if you look at the annual value, it's probably weighted 40% first half to 60% second half.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Charles Shi with Needham.\n\nYu Shi\n\nI guess, top of the mind of many investors. Can you guys provide any thoughts on the Synopsys and ANSYS merger or whatever you call it. Especially now, Cadence probably needs to execute on that Intelligent System Design strategy more organic way than -- organic way? Any thoughts would be great.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. Charles, this is Anirudh. So as you know, we have been executing on our Intelligent System Design strategy for 6 years now. We started this in 2018. And we know for a while that there will be this convergence of electrical and mechanical domains. This convergence of system and semi-companies, semi-companies becoming system companies and system companies doing silicon, as you all know. And now we have commented that about 45% of our business is coming from system companies.\r\nBut this is not -- I mean we have been executed on this from 2018 and focusing on, of course, our core business, which is EDA, expanding into SD&A, which is what we call System Design & Analysis and of course, AI over the last 5, 6 years. And if you look at our results on SD&A, even in 2023, our business revenue is up 22% in SD&A. And it has been up more than 20% for the last several years, whereas that market is not really growing at that rate. So we are gaining a lot of share in SD&A and this is primarily due to our products, right, and our customer response. So the customers have really embraced our strategy and embraced our product differentiation.\r\nSo we first started with the finite element with Clarity, and that is benchmarking very well, winning a lot of share, a lot of customers. And then recently, you must have seen our new product in CFD. CFD is a big market. That's the -- there are two big simulation areas in SD&A. One is finite element, which we are already had and the other is CFD. And with Millennium, this is like one of the most revolutionary products in CFD in the last 30 years, and I can tell you more about Millennium later.\r\nSo -- and then the third thing in our SD&A strategy is we are the only company that has a very strong position in packaging and PCB, which is critical for chiplets and 3D-IC. So overall, I feel very confident in terms of our market position. The strategy we have implemented for 6 years, and I see a lot of growth and momentum going forward.\n\nYu Shi\n\nMaybe a follow-up. I do want to dig a little bit into your digital IC design and the sign-up revenue. You reported last quarter, I think it's exceeding $300 million when it has been bumping around $250 million since, I think, early part of 2022. But then it does seem to show some really good strength since second half '23. You talked about the share gains, and I do understand this is the part where you have the most overlap with your direct competitor, Synopsys. And just really curious, how sustainable the strength you saw in Q4? And is there any color you can provide us on what's driving the revenue upside for that business in the fourth quarter? How should people think about the sustainability of that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nCharles, that's a good question on digital. I mean there are multiple reasons driving that. But I would say the main -- and we had good growth in Q4, as you saw in our digital business. But of course, the main reason that's driving that is the AI super cycle. So there's a lot more design activity. You even noticed some of our key partners, increasing the Cadence of their major kind of product development. So there is AI, in AI, we participate in several ways. One is just the build-out of the AI infrastructure, which is, of course, a great partnership with NVIDIA and all the other hyperscalers.\r\nAnd then also, our AI-enabled products like Cerebrus and Optimality and overall AI portfolio. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Cerebrus, which is the flagship product for digital implementation using AI. Our business went to 4x. So that's also providing a lot of growth in terms of -- so there's one there is overall much more design activity, especially at the most advanced node and then AI products provide acceleration on top of that.\r\nAnd then the other thing that I had mentioned before, but as people use Cerebrus, which is the overall AI product and digital implementation, it also has a pull-through of the full flow, not just place and route, but also synthesis and signoff. So what I'm very pleased to see is one AI products like Cerebrus is doing well, but they're also pulling through synthesis. Our position has improved dramatically in synthesis in the last 1 year and also a lot of signoff engagement. So overall, I'm pretty pleased with the technology progress, the AI progress, and also engagement with some big customers that traditionally were not using Cadence. And now, like we mentioned, all top 20 customers are using Cadence solutions in digital. So we'll see how it progresses, but I think it's good progress on digital, and I expect that to continue.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nCharles, I would just add to that, that in Q4, we saw some very good cash collections from customers that were kind of lower creditworthy customers that we didn't think we would collect those -- that cash. So it wasn't in our forecast. So we had some upside from that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nI actually had a question on growth. Just kind of first on the segment side, IP growth has been more modest than the entire company growth. So I was hoping if you could give us some color on that. But then Anirudh, my bigger question is that when I look at the overall sales growth for Cadence, right, so 19% in '22 than 15% last year, and now 12% is what you're guiding to for this year. I mean, these are impressive growth rates versus the semiconductor industry, but still, it shows a deceleration, right, for the last few years, which is very different then the acceleration that we see for a lot of other semiconductor companies that are exposed to the AI and Generative AI team.\r\nSo what is the right way to interpret this deceleration in your sales? Like should we be expecting acceleration back at some point as some of these AI initiatives get bigger? Or what is the right way to interpret and compare your growth rate versus the acceleration of growth in a number of the AI names?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, Vivek, good question. So first, on the IP part, like in '23, I think first 3 quarters, we had -- the growth was much more challenged is primarily with the compare the previous year, but as you know, and some of the macro uncertainties but as you can see in Q4, we had very strong growth in IP, more than 30% growth in IP. And also, this whole AI super cycle, as you know, is driving much more disaggregation right? So the 3D-IC is consolidated at HPC and AI application and that requires more IP, like UCIe or SerDes IP, and then HBM and memory IP. And that's why we acquired assets of the 5 assets of Rambus and overall our own portfolio and UCIe and DDR and all is doing pretty well. And then we did start several acquisitions to improve our talent in IP. So overall, I do think because of AI, because of our own actions that IP should do much better in '24. That's our current modeling.\r\nAnd '23 had some unusual challenges like I mentioned. But going forward, IP business should improve. And we have focused on profitability over the last few years in our IP business. And I think I'm pleased to say that the profitability levels we are happy with now, okay? So now I think we can focus more on growth and expanding our portfolio. And you may have also seen that there's all these other activity as most advanced nodes and more foundries, and we're also pleased with our partnership with Intel, Intel Foundry that we just announced today. And also all the other major foundries, but we are glad to do much more with IFS, and that should also help our IP business going forward.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nAnd Vivek, I'd just like to add, I mean you asked about how to look at the revenue growth. We tend to look over a 3-year CAGR because most of our customers are on 3-year baseline contracts on the software side. And if you look at -- since 2017, our 3-year CAGR has been accelerating, and it continues to accelerate. In 2022, we hit 15%. We actually exceeded 15% on a 3-year CAGR basis. For last year, we're very, very pleased that we were over 15% again. And then at the midpoint of the guide for '24, the 3-year CAGR is about 15.3%. So that will be 3 consecutive years of over 15% revenue growth on a 3-year CAGR basis. Now from time to time, you can get some lumpiness in things like hardware timing or IP timing, and that can distort individual quarters or individual years. But we do think looking over a 3-year CAGR basis is probably the best way to look at it. That's how we look at it ourselves.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nGot it. And for my follow-up, maybe, John, one or two clarifications, what's the assumption for China contribution in '24? And then the incremental EBIT, I think from the guidance, it seems like it's below 50%, right? It's still impressive, but it is below what we have been used to the last few years. So if you could clarify that, that would be very helpful also.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. Sure. Great questions again, Vivek. On the incremental margin front, we typically don't start the year in the initial guide with over 50%. We tend to start lower than that and we build towards greater than 50% with growth through the year. As you know, we always like to under promise and over deliver. But -- and if you look at our incremental margin over the last few years that it was slightly lower in 2023 compared to previous years. And that's because -- on the organic side, we had incremental margins north of 55%, but we did some acquisitions. And typically, when you have an acquisition, it can be dilutive in the early year or two, but -- and that's a bit of a headwind for incremental margins.\r\nIn relation to China, glad you asked me about that. But China, the last 4 years for China, China has contributed 15% of our 2020 revenue, then followed that with 13% of '21, 15% in '22 and 17% in '23. Now last year, I think China benefited from that large hardware backlog that we had. That was kind of an outsized portion of that backlog was for the China region. So it was a boom year last year for China. I wouldn't expect to repeat that this year. In fact, our guide, we'd expect China to be flat or slightly down. So we've kind of derisked China into the 14% to 15% range for this year, which would be consistent with the previous 3 years.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nGary Wade Mobley\n\nLet me apologize in advance for the background noise. I want to ask about the disconnect between record levels of cRPO and what is assumed in your revenue outlook and as well your higher outlook for upfront revenue. And so why the assumption that less of that cRPO translates into revenue in fiscal year '24, especially considering the higher mix of upfront?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, Gary, good question. The -- yes, in terms of cRPO and the relationship between cRPO and this year's revenue, if you recall last year, we had over 6 months of hardware backlog in cRPO at the end of 2022. So a large portion of our hardware revenue in '23 came out of backlog at the end of '22, we ramped up production capacity and we're back to more normal levels of about 8 weeks lead time now for deliveries on the hardware, which is really, really important for customers. Customers want to be able to purchase the hardware and feel like they're going to get delivery of that hardware within the year. So typically, your revenue and hardware is more correlated to your production capacity than it is to what's coming out of backlog versus what's coming out of new business in the year.\r\nAnd as a result of addressing those hardware lead times, the revenue profile for this year takes a slightly different shape to 2023. In 2023, in Q1, we had a lot of hardware coming out of backlog in 2024, we expect another record hardware revenue year and the business is planning to build more hardware each quarter throughout 2024 to meet that demand. But there's kind of more of, I guess, hardware revenue is expected to grow quarter-over-quarter this year, whereas last year, Q1 was our biggest hardware quarter.\n\nGary Wade Mobley\n\nJust to be clear, John, cRPO does not include hardware backlog that RPO does?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nThe cRPO would include hardware. I mean, even when you have over 6 months hardware delivery lead time, it would all be expected to revenue in a year. So that's -- although it's in your backlog, it's also all in your cRPO. So cRPO last year would have had a lot more hardware in it than cRPO this year, certainly on the product revenue side.\n\nGary Wade Mobley\n\nAll right. And I wanted to circle back, Anirudh on the metric you gave in your prepared remarks, that is a quadrupling of the Cerebrus run rate at several market-shaping customers. So should we take that to mean the annual contract value for those who took Cerebrus at market-shaping customers quadrupled -- or maybe if you can just clarify that I'm missing that?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nGary, so, yes. I think Cerebrus doing very well. It deployed at all the top 10 customers. And actually, even AI, in general, we mentioned a number of customer engagements are up like 10x in the last 12 months. And so Cerebrus run rate, as we have mentioned before, the Cerebrus business, first, the customers will try some and then they will adopt more. So I think what's good to see in Q4 is what people were -- what the customers were doing and then they have adopted that at a much bigger rate.\r\nSo we are happy to see that. I think there is still room to go in that. Like we have always mentioned that we think it will take 2 contract cycles and we are like that 6 years and we are like 2 years into it or 2 or 3 years into it. But that's good in our model, right? We want consistent growth going forward. But yes, the uptick in Cerebrus is very promising. And then the other products are -- came a little after Cerebrus, like Verisium or Allegro X AI or Virtuoso Studio or Optimality, and they're also seeing good progression.\r\nSo overall, in terms of AI, what I'm very happy about is we are -- I mentioned this before also in the last call, we have 3 big ways to benefit from AI. And this is true for any kind of new technology. There are a lot of comparisons to AI, but if you compare it to like the Internet, the first phase is the infrastructure development, okay? So -- and this -- our marquee partnership with NVIDIA, which we have had for more than a decade, and we talked about it today with developing AI products with them, them developing their own chips. Palladium, we are a development partner with NVIDIA in Palladium for more than a decade, and that also puts Palladium in a very strong position with all the other kind of AI developments. So that's the first phase of AI benefit, which is more the infrastructure.\r\nAnd then the second phase is like what you asked, which is our own products. And it started with Cerebrus in digital side, but now we have 5 major kind of co-pilot platforms in all the 5 businesses, and those are progressing pretty well moving from like initial deployments to more wider deployments. And that's the second phase of AI deployments in which AI will be adopted into existing products like chip design and system design. And one thing I want to point out is there's a lot of talk of what is a good application for AI. I believe one of the best applications for AI is chip design. It's because over the last 30 years, we have done so much work in automatic chip design. We have a language like RTL, we have all kinds of optimization we have built in. So the chip process is already very automated. So it's an ideal thing to apply AI on top of it for chip and system design, which is what we are seeing.\r\nAnd then the third phase of AI is new products it will enable. And I believe for several years, and that's why the investment in OpenEye, the OpenEye, the biggest new market that AI will enable will be life sciences, okay, and biosimulation and bio life sciences. And I think you will see that years going forward. So there are these 3 phases of our AI activity. One is AI infrastructure. Two is applying AI to our own products for chip and system design. And third is AI in bio and life sciences. So overall, I'm very pleased, very confident in our positioning in AI and the results we have delivered.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nAnirudh, you noted the large number of new products you've introduced just in the last year, Virtuoso Studio, Optimality, Allegro X and so forth. And then, of course, Millennium just a couple of weeks ago. Could you talk about how you're thinking about the contribution of those incrementally collectively this year as part of your guidance and perhaps even rank the ones that you think might be most incremental to your revenue growth this year over and above the pre-existing products such as Innovus and the signoff products, then I've follow-up.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nJay, good question. I mean, as you know, we are a very innovative company, and we have done that for years now, and we invest one of the highest percentages of R&D -- of revenue into R&D. And then it's good to have all these new products in multiple areas, of course, the 3 big areas being like EDA, SDA and AI. But we don't try to like rank our children. We want all of them to do well, and it's also difficult to predict how it will -- because these are all for the long run, right? So there is, of course, a lot of momentum with the AI products. There's a lot of momentum with 3D-IC and chiplet as you know. There's Millennium, I'm super excited about. I think this is the biggest innovation in CFD in the last 30 years. And I talked about the 3-layer cake, right? Which is AI orchestration at the top layer, physical simulation, physics-based modeling at the middle layer and then accelerate compute at the bottom layer and CFD needed to be disrupted in that context, right?\r\nSo we have -- and we didn't talk about it much when we made the acquisition about 2 years ago. There is acquisition from Stanford Cascade, which is very, very high fidelity, very accurate to CFD. So we had that at the heart of it. And then AI on top and then accelerate compute at the bottom together with NVIDIA. And this completely changes the game in CFD. For the first time, we are able to simulate entire cars and planes in few hours is almost emulation for systems that has never been possible before. So there is a lot of potential in Millennium. Now because Millennium is a new product, we are offering both cloud and on-prem.\r\nPalladium is mostly, as you know, on our chip business, Palladium is mostly on-prem but Millennium is both in CFD. And right now, the -- most of the customers are choosing the cloud version, which is great. It's more ratable, okay? So then Millennium and then you must have seen today, we have this great partnership with Dassault. Actually, I'm also pretty happy about that. Dassault is a leader in PLM and MCAD, and overall partnership. We have broadening partnership with this. So -- and then we talked about our IP business, how that can grow and this new partnership with Intel and IFS hardware continues to do well. So I think it's good to have multiple engines contributing to the growth. And then we always focus on margin at the same time. So we are well positioned going forward. But it's difficult to predict which one will do better than the others, and we don't guide on a product basis anyway.\n\nJay Vleeschhouwer\n\nRight. So that's a good segue to my follow-up. And since you mentioned so Dassault, Cadence is actually quite visible here at the conference today. And so my question is, when you think about your ISD strategy generally and perhaps CFD specifically, could you talk about the kind of resources and investments you're having to make to effectuate that strategy beyond or over and above the core EDA strategy? And what do you know now about those markets that you might not have known 3, 4, 5 years ago when you were much earlier in developing the strategy.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, Jay, that's a good question. I mean one thing to point out, our SDA business is about in 2023 is about 12% of revenue. So it's already at a good pace. And also, it has enough scale now to apply significant R&D to that space, and also simulation space, right? We know simulation space pretty well. And there's a lot of high R&D synergies from our EDA, R&D to SDA, R&D. So I'm pretty happy with how much R&D we have invested and we'll continue to invest there. But at the same time, it is also very profitable, okay? Which is -- which our model always, right? It's not just revenue growth but also profitability.\r\nAnd which we -- when you asked me, we thought it should be more profitable when we started 6 years ago because simulation is more profitable in EDA. So that's what is playing out in SDA. So it is pretty profitable. And it has played out roughly to the extent I thought it would. In simulation always is accuracy first and then performance and capacity and the market is always looking for new simulators and that's how it has played out in electromagnetic.\r\nAnd then in CFD, now I'm much more confident with this disruption, this massive disruption with Millennium. And the key thing with Dassault, and we have mentioned this before, as we -- I'm very confident in SD&A. You can see in terms of product synergy, product differentiation. But we have always said that we are a competition software company, so that also means what we will not do, right? So typically, things in the system space, which are not as computational are things like PLM, things like implementation MCAD, mechanical CAD platforms and Dassault is the clear leader in those. They are great in PLM, they are great in with SOLIDWORKS, in CATIA in the high end. So it's a perfect partner for Cadence. As we focus on competition software and EDA and SBA, packaging and PCB to partner with Dassault and we're glad to see that expansion that was announced today.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\n\nYour -- back to your IP business, it was up 4, 5 percentage points last year. And I know that it was a relatively tough comp relative to 2022, but I would have thought that the growth in IP would have been closer to your overall growth, just given that higher chip design complexity does motivate your customers to license more IP in order to drive efficiencies in their chip design cycle time. So was there some customer push off of IP into this year, just maybe given timing of customer programs? Or was there some other dynamic that played in relative to your outlook for 12% total growth this year? How do you think your IP business does this year?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, good question. I think the shape of the IP revenue last year was a little atypical. I mean I think the two reasons were that in 2023, we had very, very strong Q4. But first 3 quarters were not strong at all. So overall year is in the single digits, like you mentioned, but a very strong Q4. So I think there are a couple of reasons for that. And one is that there were some tough compares from '22 to '23 in IP, especially in the beginning of the year. And then like I mentioned, of course, last couple of years, the macro environment has been tough, though it is improving now. And then IP typically gets affected more than others in terms of a tough macro semiconductor environment.\r\nSo as a combination of that, I think the first 3 quarters were more challenging. But Q4 and then going into this year, I'm pretty cautiously optimistic about IP. One, our portfolio is better, is broader. And then this whole AI super cycle, like I mentioned, and then new engagements we have, like with IFS and other companies. So overall, I feel better about '24 John, do you want to comment about the assumption.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, yes. Of course, Harlan, as you know, we always focus on profitable and scalable revenue growth and the IP revenue contributes largely to our upfront revenue percentage. But last year for 2023, our upfront revenue percentage increased from 15% to 16%. That was on the back of a strong record hardware year. But as you say, IP revenue growth was quite low in comparison to prior years. This year, we're expecting the 16% to go to 17.5%. That's because we expect both of those to contribute significantly to improvement in upfront revenue this year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nAnd then we expect the IP growth to be higher than Cadence average this year. We'll see how it plays out. Okay. Yes.\n\nHarlan L. Sur\n\nPerfect. And then good to see the strong outperformance on the SDA business, right, up 22% last year, certainly outgrowing the overall market in your peers in that segment. The recent Millennium M1 supercomputer, I think, it's a great example of the synergies between your chip design portfolio, your SDA portfolio, right? You're basically taking the success you've had in hardware-based verification and emulation sort of bringing that same concept to your SDA portfolio. It seems like there would be a lot of untapped demand for hardware acceleration within your SDA customer base? Like how big is this market opportunity for the team as you look out over the next several years?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nAbsolutely. Even for 30 years, even when I was in grad school, I always believe that hardware acceleration is a massive opportunity for EDA and SDA in general. And you see that worn out in Palladium. So we have always dreamed about hardware acceleration. And that's why there's 3-layer cake. Hardware acceleration is the bottom layer and of course, AI orchestration is the top layer. And a perfect example is Palladium. Now in Palladium and hardware emulation, what happened is if you look at overall functional verification on the chip side first, it's more than a $2 billion business. I think if you look at all the software and hardware became roughly 50% of that. So hardware-assisted verification became almost 50% of chip verification.\r\nNow CFD is also a $2 billion business. And it needed this hardware-based acceleration along with AI, so I don't know whether it will play out the same way, but there is a potential of a big portion of CFD to go to hardware-based acceleration. Now it will take a few years. And we are clearly leading in that. And the other thing it does, the hardware-based acceleration or emulation for CFD is it will improve the area -- it will improve the market size of CFD as well.\r\nLike I was talking to one of these big aerospace companies. And they said, current CFD, the current simulation is only done to 20% of the flight envelope. Which is unheard of in chip design. In chip design, we simulate 99-point-some percent of the use cases so that when the chip comes back, it works. But if you look at the system domain because the accuracy is not there because the speed is not there, they're only covering 20% of the use cases and all of them only in software. So the potential with Millennium is one that 20% goes to much closer to much higher than 50%. And then a big portion of that can go to hardware-assisted emulation and verification. And by the way, the same thing can repeat again, this 3-layer can repeat again in bio, which is a few years out.\r\nBut I think right now, the opportunity is there in system simulation and CFD. So I'm pretty optimistic. But it's a new use case for that market. And sometimes the new use cases can take some time to deploy. So we always have to be cautious about that. But the response so far has been phenomenal. And people -- and because they were doing some of this themselves, the customers, but to have a combined solution with AI, software and hardware and you are exactly right. It mimics our success we have done on the chip side.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Marco Conti with Deutsche Bank.\n\nJohn Marco Conti\n\nI know you've touched on this already, but could you run us again through the phasing of top line and margins through 2024 guidance, as well as providing some more color on what is causing the lower level of revenue seasonality in your Q1 guidance given Q1 implies 22% versus the median of 25% over the past 7 years in terms of its seasonality. Can we explain this perhaps by hardware and/or IP timing? Or is there something else?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nJohny, for the question. But yes, on the revenue side, the -- we expect 2024 to take a slightly different shape to 2023. That's largely a function of the revenue mix by quarter. You'll recall last year in 2023, we had 20% upfront revenue in Q1 when the year ended up at 16%, but this year, for Q1, we're expecting 14% in Q1 when the year is expected to be 17.5%. So clearly, from that, you expect that -- we'd expect that upfront revenue to increase quarter after quarter this year, whereas last year, Q1 was really the high watermark for upfront revenue.\r\nAnd then on the expense side, we've invested heavily. We have about 1,000 extra heads this year. And that's for continued innovation, and we're launching new products all the time. But -- so with that expense on some of the acquisitions is more front loaded for the year. And as a result, that's kind of feeding into lower margins for Q1 in comparison to the rest of the year. For Q2, Q3 and Q4, we'd expect margins to be similar or higher than last year. Yes. I think that's -- those are probably the main things to get across.\n\nJohn Marco Conti\n\nYes, that was really good. Really helpful. And perhaps just one last follow-up on the commentary around expectations of operating cash flow into next year. I mean the lower end timing seems flat. So perhaps what are the moving levers there. And also, how come 70% of the backlog is flowing into 2024 compared to 75% in '23?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. Johny, that's -- yes, let me take the second part first, and then I'll come back to the cash question. But -- so last year, we had over 6 months of lead times -- for hardware delivery lead time. So there was a lot of last year's hardware revenue came out of backlog. The 5% shift can pretty much all be allocated to less hardware coming out of backlog for this year. Now hardware revenue for the year will probably be more of a reflection like it has been in the last few years of just how much hardware we're able to produce in the year, and we expect to increase hardware production each quarter for this year. But to meet the demand that we're expecting. But last year, the operating cash flow was kind of muted. It was less than -- although we beat on all our metrics, we came in just under the midpoint of $1.350 billion, I think it was $1.349 billion for operating cash flow, but that included us investing spending a lot to ramp up on purchase -- advanced purchase of raw materials to build that inventory that we believe we need for hardware this year.\r\nWe intend to do that again in Q1. But -- so we've already included that in our operating cash guide. So we're investing some of that operating cash to improve gross margins by prepurchasing a bunch of raw materials that we believe we need for -- to keep up with the demand on the hardware side. Now the other thing I wanted to highlight is that the business's forecast for hardware is again for another record hardware revenue year and for hardware demand to continue to accelerate quarter after quarter this year. Normally, I wouldn't include some of their expected demand for the second half. But until I see the -- it's a pipeline business. So we look at lead times. We look at the pipeline kind of closer to the summer before taking up the second half of the year. So the guide does not include the full forecast from the business. I'd like to hedge that back in the second half until we get to the summer. I'd prefer to see the pipeline come through. And then there is potential to take the second half higher when we see that pipeline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research.\n\nJoshua Alexander Tilton\n\nJohn, you kind of anticipated what I was going to ask with your last comment there. So I just want to clarify very simply, is what you -- should we just interpret what you said is that even this strong upfront revenue guide, which I think implies another year of 20%-plus growth would still fall under the motto of underpromise and overdeliver?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, I think that's fair. That's fair. But I didn't include the full forecast. The guide would have been higher. Of course, we have a strong IP as well this year. I mean, certainly compared to last year. IP didn't contribute a huge amount. I mean it's been a great business for us. but we're much more confident going into '24 of the IP contribution to 2024 revenue. But hardware is going to be strong. Again, I mean, by nature, we always like to kind of hold back on the second half guide for hardware until we see the pipeline around summertime. So we haven't included the full forecast from the business in the guide.\n\nJoshua Alexander Tilton\n\nSuper helpful. And then just my follow-up is, how do you see the competition maybe specifically in digital changing, if at all? If Synopsys can indeed close this ANSYS acquisition and fully integrate ANSYS's tool set into their design flow.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nWell, I don't think that will change the competitive landscape at all. That's my assessment in digital or even in SD&A. Because digital, anyway, we are competing very effectively in the marketplace. And with this AI, it is pulling in a full digital full flow position. I think your comment may be more tied to a part of digital, which is like 3D-IC. But with 3D-IC, we always talked about there are three big portions of 3D-IC. There is an actual chip implementation tools, which is -- I mean digital is much bigger than that, right? Digital, we have a very big business, which is growing at all the top 20 customers. But 3D-IC has these three components to it. One is the chip design tools.\r\nSo in chip design tools, we are the only company that has both analog and digital chip implementation, okay? And the second part in 3D-IC is packaged design and Cadence is the leader in packaged design, and that thing is still a very strong differentiation no matter what the M&A news is outside. And then the third part is the simulation tools like thermal and electromagnetic and there, we are already doing pretty well. So I'm very confident in our product positioning and competitive advantage. No matter what happens on the M&A side because anyway, we are competing very effectively.\r\nAnd then the other thing that is good about Cadence is we also formed a very strong partnership in the ecosystem. We talked about Dassault on the SD&A side. But the other one that I want to highlight, we have a lot of news today, but one of the things that I want to highlight is our partnership with Arm. Arm is also expanding into what they call Total Design, going into more towards silicon, more towards custom solutions. And we are the exclusive partner with Arm as they go implement that. And that really also helps our digital business. And -- so overall, I feel pretty confident in our digital position, including 3D-IC.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nAnirudh, I just had a quick question, I guess, to go back to Vivek's question on growth rates, I understand the 3-year CAGR, it's been excellent. It's been growing, and that's really nice to see. But when you think about these phases of AI at this point, is it too early to start thinking about contribution from AI as you go through these renewals? I mean can you talk about how -- if there is -- if you're seeing an impact yet or what that impact is or how we should think about AI as sort of if you think about the next 3 years or contribution to growth looking forward?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. I think AI is definitely helping us already, like we mentioned about our AI tools by itself has gone up by 3x and then Cerebrus more higher than that. And then also AI itself is the infrastructure part of AI, like our partnership with NVIDIA and all the hyperscalers. So overall, we are pretty pleased with that. But of course, we are mostly a ratable business. So these things take like multiple years to bleed in. And I think that's fine. Our model always is to have strong revenue growth and margin growth. So I think this thing will still take multiple years to come into our model, but that's -- I think that's a good thing. It provides multiple years of growth.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes. I think it's very early innings right now on the AI adoption. We've been focused mainly on proliferation. And we're very, very pleased with the uptake of our AI tools and just how strongly they're growing on the booking side. It is starting to feed into the P&L already. But as Anirudh says, because it's ratable, that takes time to show up in total. But very, very early innings in adoption of AI tools right now. I think there's a lot more to go.\n\nRuben Roy\n\nRight, right. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just quickly, John, you talked a lot about the hardware and I think it's pretty clear at this point. But just to make sure I understand, it sounds like lead times have normalized. Is that correct? And also in terms of sort of the visibility you get from your customer base, that hasn't changed, right? Is that what you're saying in terms of how far out your customers are ordering, and then I guess it would be just kind of a function of increased attach rates, which has given you the confidence that you're going to have another big growth here in hardware. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nNo, I think you are. Yes, yes. I mean the business has great confidence in terms of what they're hearing from customers and customers' plans and budget plans. But I push back on the forecast and as you know, I mean, the hardware itself, from a purchasing perspective, has some degree of seasonality in it, like Q4 would always be bigger for purchasing activity from customers than in Q1. And now that we're down to more normal lead times, you kind of have that growth quarter-over-quarter built into the forecast. Now again, I've been conservative in the second half on that forecast. But still even with my conservatism, I still have second half being higher than the first half of hardware.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird.\n\nJoseph D. Vruwink\n\nJust a follow-up on some of the earlier questions. So I think of your growth is being tied to the R&D budgets at your customers, not the revenue at your customers and certainly, R&D budgets, they tend to move around more steadily perhaps. And then Anirudh, you mentioned earlier, a lot of your revenue is ratable at the same time. So basically, changes can take some time to work through the model. I just wanted to ask, though, because I think 2024 has the potential to see a pretty big inflection in R&D spending within the semi customer base? If you are maybe seeing that, a, is it included in your outlook starting the year and then b, if it does end up moving higher and influencing kind of renewals and purchasing decisions, does that actually manifest in a bigger way, probably more in 2025 than it really would in 2024?\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes, Joe, that's a very good observation. I mean, definitely, the -- we are -- like we are very diversified, we are very ratable, we are tied to R&D, which are all good things in our model. And then the mood seems to be changing a little bit, '23, as we have mentioned before, was a tough environment, though we kind of grew very well. And there was some change I feel in Q4 in the overall -- I mean, you guys know that as well in the overall macro sentiment and maybe there will be more investment in '24 and '25. But I think we based our outlook and John can comment more on the backlog that we see rather than guessing what will happen in '24 and '25. But if there is an improvement in R&D, then that's good for our business. But we do see there's a lot of design activity. And then we see our position improving EDA and IP especially this year and continue expanding in SDA and AI.\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, certainly, everyone feels seems to be more optimistic this time this year compared to this time last year. This time last year, everyone was asking me, when was the recession going to happen. But this year, design activity seems to be strong. Even when we talk about China, we're still seeing strong design activity in China, but I derisk the guide for that because part of the large outperformance in China last year in achieving 17% of our revenue was because of that hardware backlog. And now that we're back to more normal lead times, we thought it's prudent to assume that China revenue drops back to prior levels of between kind of 14%, 15%. But -- so that's embedded in the guide. I thought the right -- I mean we always -- the approach at this time of the year is always tried to derisk the guide for the things that we think people might be concerned about, but -- and then have the business focused on doing the best business with customers for the long term that we always feel our Cadence employees do the best business when they're not chasing.\n\nJoseph D. Vruwink\n\nOkay. Yes, I think that's all smart. And then I guess, John, just on kind of your approach to forecasting the upfront revenues. I think in 3Q, you were kind of intimating that, look, we're running at kind of an elevated share of total. We haven't typically been 15% coming from upfront products, so maybe it normalizes. And now it's changing and suddenly it's going to remain a higher share of total. Can you just go into what changed in 4Q? And is any of that kind of AI, obviously, verification hardware, I mean these AI designs basically need the cutting edge is AI acutely being seen in the strength of your hardware order activity?\n\nJohn M. Wall\n\nYes, yes, of course. That's -- and partly, it's -- I mean, if you've seen over the last number of years, we've seen the upfront contribution to our revenue mix has been increasing, and it went from 15% in '22 to 16% last year. And I think what you're referring to is we expect it to go to 17.5% this year. That's a virtue of an expectation that we're going to have another record hardware revenue year that we expect stronger IP growth this year compared to last. We feel much more confident in the contribution from IP growth and of course, we're launching new products all the time.\r\nNow in relation to things like Millennium, we expect a large part of Millennium sales to be cloud-based but maybe not all of them will be cloud-based. I think that's another tailwind potentially for upfront revenue for the year. But I've hedged back slightly, what I expect in the second half because I'd like to see the pipeline in the summer before we take that up even higher. But the forecast is higher than 17.5%, but I'm only comfortable going out with a guide of 17.5% for upfront revenue for this year.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nAnd just to add, I mean, AI contributes to -- I mean, AI design activity, as you know, contributes to hardware strength, given our strong position. And also AI is more HPC and chiplet-based and it does help our IP business as well, and then all the comments on Millennium. So -- but let's see how it progresses. But yes, I mean, the IP is also strong this year, along with hardware and Millennium.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn it back to Anirudh Devgan for closing remarks.\n\nAnirudh Devgan\n\nYes. Thank you all for joining us this afternoon. It's an exciting time for Cadence as we enter 2024 with product leadership and strong business momentum. Our continued execution of the Intelligent System Design strategy, customer-first mindset and a high-performance and inclusive culture are driving accelerating growth as we grow our core EDA business, while expanding our portfolio.

        "content": "Market News\n\nWall Street closed with a mixed performance on Monday as investors awaited crucial inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. NVIDIA market value surpassing Amazon added to the market dynamics. The Dow index concluded in positive territory, contrasting with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, which ended in the negative zone.\n\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.4%, or 135.76 points, to close at 38,807.45. Notably, 11 components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 19 were in green.\r\n\r\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.3% or 42.74 points to finish at 15,947.92. The tech-laden index reached its intraday all-time high of 16,212.23 hit in November 2021.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.1% to end at 5,022.49. Three out of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark ended in negative territory, while eight were in the positive zone. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) declined 0.8%, 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLU) gained 1.1%.\r\n\r\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7.7% to 13.93.

        "content": "Easing inflation and rising optimism surrounding rate cuts sent stocks on a rally at the end of last year and the positive sentiment has been continuing. On Feb 9, the S&P 500 hit yet another milestone, breaching the 5,000 mark for the first time to close at 5,026.61 points.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally has been continuing this year after a solid 2023 when it ended 23.9% higher. The index is now more than 6% higher on a year-to-date basis. A number of factors are boosting investors’ confidence, which has been helping Wall Street.\n\nRobust economic data, slowing inflation, and expectations of multiple rate cuts this year, along with solid four-quarter earnings, have lifted investors’ sentiment.\n\nU.S. GDP grew a solid 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, surpassing estimates of a rise of 2%. Overall, U.S. GDP grew 2.5% in 2023, higher than 1.9% a year earlier.\n\nAlso, inflation has declined sharply over the past year, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening policy that saw it hike interest rates by 525 basis points to take its benchmark policy rate to the range of 5.25-5.50%.\n\nCore CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell to 3.9% annually in December from 4% in November. Also, core PCE inflation, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, increased a meager 0.2% month over month in December, while it increased 2.9% annually, the lowest annual rate of interest since March 2021.\n\nInvestors are now trying to gauge when the Federal Reserve will go for its first rate cut. Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell sounded a bit hawkish and said that a March rate cut is unlikely, investors are pricing in at least five rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year. Investors are now expecting the first rate cut in May.\n\nAlso, the fourth-quarter earnings season has turned out to be quite impressive. As of Feb 9, 338 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their quarterly results, with total earnings of these companies up 5% compared to the same period last year, while revenues are up 3.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe optimistic scenario has also resulted in a solid rebound in consumer confidence. The Conference Board said that the U.S. consumer confidence level index rose to 114.8 in January, from December’s reading of 108, the highest since December 2021.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, American Express Company AXP, Colgate-Palmolive Company CL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN thathave a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 268.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nAmerican Express Company is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. AXP offers business travel-related services through its non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV).\n\nAmerican Express Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. AXP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company’s business strategy closely defines efforts to increase its leadership in key product categories through innovation in core businesses, tracking adjacent categories’ growth and expansion into new markets and channels. Due to the shift of consumer preference to organic and natural ingredients, CL is expanding its Naturals range, including Naturals toothpaste.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.2% over the last 60 days. CL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world’s largest social media platform. META’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.96 billion people on a monthly basis as of Sep 30, 2023.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected earnings growth rate of 31.9% for the current year.

OKE is well-poised to gain from increasing volumes in its pipelines and fee-based commitments as production volumes are rising.

        "title": "Tyler Technologies (TYL) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Tyler Technologies TYL is slated to report fourth-quarter 2023 results after market close on Feb 14.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.86 per share, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.66. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $483.3 million, calling for a 6.9% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nTyler surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 3.8%.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, TYL’s non-GAAP earnings of $2.14 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents. However, revenues of $494.7 million missed the consensus mark of $495.5 million.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nTyler Technologies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTyler Technologies, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tyler Technologies, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nTyler’s fourth-quarter top line is likely to have benefited from the demand for its subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions as the public sector continues to transition from on-premise and outdated systems to scalable cloud-based systems. Our estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter Subscription segment revenues is pegged at $281.9 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 9.8%.\n\nHowever, public sector entities’ continued shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace is likely to have negatively impacted Tyler’s Software Licenses and Royalties segment revenues. Our estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.3 million.\n\nOur estimate for Professional Services revenues stands at $65.2 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 9.2%. Our estimate of $115.4 million for the Maintenance segment’s third-quarter revenues suggests a year-over-year decrease of 1.7%.\n\nOverall, our estimate for the company’s Total Subscriptions, Professional Services and Maintenance revenues, which include all the four abovementioned segments, is pegged at $472.5 million. This calls for a year-over-year increase of 6.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Tyler’s closed acquisitions over the past 12 months are anticipated to have brought incremental revenues during the quarter under review. TYL bought three businesses in the last 12 months, namely ARInspect, ResourceX and Computing System Innovations or CSI and Safeground Analytics.\n\nHowever, ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues might have disrupted Tyler’s business during the period in discussion. Inflationary pressures might have led public sector entities to delay procurement processes and lengthen sales cycles, which could have hurt Tyler’s revenues in the quarter under review.\n\nAdditionally, the acceleration in the shift to the cloud in the new business and the related decline in license revenues are likely to have weighed on operating margins. Also, higher operating expenses are expected to have clipped TYL’s profitability during the quarter to be reported.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tyler this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nThough Tyler currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, AutoZone AZO and Block SQ have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.26%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 21. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.51 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 412.5%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $20.18 billion, calling for a year-over-year rise of 233.5%.\n\nAutoZone is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.83% at present. AutoZone’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.9%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $26.18 per share, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $24.64. AutoZone’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 4.4% to $3.85 billion.\n\nBlock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, with the average surprise being 11%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block’s fourth-quarter earnings stands at 60 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 172.7%. It is estimated to report revenues of $5.69 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 22.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Widespread catalysts are rocketing some cryptos as the global crypto market is surging upward.\n\nThis will be the year that the crypto market outshines the traditional equity markets, notable due to the stretched valuation of tech companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nOftentimes, the crypto market and the broader indices such as the S&P 500 move in tandem with a strong correlation. This happens especially during bull markets like we’ve been witnessed over the past few weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThen, it sends a strong signal for investors to scoop up these cryptos to buy before they peak. So, let’s consider the top three.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin cryptocurrency with pile of coins, Vector illustrator\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe main coin that should be on everyone’s mind is Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The scheduled halving event in April is projected to significantly impact Bitcoin’s supply/demand dynamics.\n\nBTC tends to rally before and after the halving event takes place. With the recent approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, expect less liquidity for institutions to buy from over-the-counter markets. This will move them closer to buying from exchanges and thus, directly driving up the price of the currency.\n\nThese events have some analysts feeling very bullish, with predictions suggesting that Bitcoin could reach as high as $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nSolana (SOL) Concept art of the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSolana (SOL-USD) is a high-performance blockchain that supports decentralized applications and finance. A February purchase could lead to substantial future gains. The network reported a substantial increase in active developers, daily user transactions, and unique fee payers at the end of last year.\n\nAdditionally, SOL will be focusing on Runtime v2, which promises to significantly improve network performance. Also, it will attract more developers to the platform. Runtime V2 aims for network efficiency and its Move programming language will allow for accessible, developer collaboration.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of SOL’s price action, some analysts anticipate potential dips into the $70s before a recovery. But, the overarching sentiment remains optimistic. As a popular altcoin, a rising BTC price may lift SOL to new heights and into more bullish territory. Also, technical analyses suggest that Solana is on a stable upward path.\n\nChainlink (LINK) A physical token representing the Chainlink (LINK-USD) crypto.\n\nSource: Stanslavs / Shutterstock.com\n\nChainlink (LINK-USD) is a decentralized oracle network that’s making a comeback. This crypto was once a hot name in the industry before its popularity was overtaken by meme coins and other options.\n\nThis year could be big for LINK, as it rolls out its Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). And, it will integrate traditional finance (TradFi) markets with real-world assets (RWA) on the blockchain. This would allow people to tokenize and fractionalize assets such as real estate. In turn, that gives investors the option to own a tiny fraction of its overall value versus buying it outright.\n\nMarket analysts have a positive outlook on Chainlink’s price potential in the coming years. Some predictions have set to reach over $100 by the end of this year, and $126 per token by 2030. It trades at $20.30 at the time of writing.\n\nWith big developments on the horizon, investing in LINK now could lead to big gains down the road.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has surged over 5,000 for the first time largely due to significant increases in a few massive tech stocks.\n\nThe runs of stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), who are among the group that was dubbed the Magnificent Seven, have been well documented to this point. And we recently pointed out that their market dominance has made sense when considering their outsized contribution to the benchmark's earnings projections.\n\nIf earnings are the ultimate driver of long-term stock performance, then it's logical that the companies that contribute the most earnings growth to the benchmark will see outsized stock returns.\n\nBut the run of Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading earnings projections isn't projected to last for all of 2024.\n\nNew research from Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian shows the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to grow earnings by more than the Seven in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAs seen in our chart of the day, the earnings recovery of the other 493 stocks would mark a significant reversal of earnings leadership in recent quarters. To Subramanian, this could signal a shift in stock market leadership too.\n\n\"We believe the narrowing growth differential will be the catalyst for the market broadening out,\" Subramanian and her Bank of America colleague Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis earnings shift puts fundamental backing to one of the most prominent calls on Wall Street to start 2024: The stock market rally will broaden. Subramanian says this will likely come in \"June or earlier.\"\n\nOn top of the earnings turnaround, Subramanian also highlights the Fed's interest rate path will play a key role in why market returns are expected to broaden. The June prediction is in line with projections from the bank's economics team for the first rate cut to come in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd this speaks to a larger thread that's formed among the folks who see a broadening coming — that the Fed's rate path needs to be more certain first. A construction crew pours concrete on the sixth floor of a 15-story residential apartment building in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, on Dec. 18, 2018. (Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) (Robert Nickelsberg via Getty Images)\n\nFundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote on Friday that his prediction for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200 is \"looking too conservative.\" But in the shorter term Lee believes \"uncertainty\" around the Fed could cause investors to get anxious.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider recently explained a similar theory to Yahoo Finance that once investors stop \"worrying so much\" about when exactly the Fed will cut, the rally can broaden as investor's come to terms with earnings expectations like those seen in Subramanian's chart.\n\n\"If I'm looking out over the next six or 12 markets, I do think we'll see an expansion in market breadth,\" Snider said.\n\nAnd it's not about seeing the Big Tech stocks tumble, he added. \"I think it's more likely you start to see more robust performance across the remainder of the equity market.\"\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNasdaq Composite Back in Action: 5 Top Picks\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. — the world's largest contract chipmaker — recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nFuture Catalyst\n\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\n\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration’s R&D efforts.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance.\n\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\n\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nIt’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\n\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\n\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Chip giant Arm floated in New York last year after deciding against a launch in London - REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nBritish semiconductor champion Arm has eclipsed the value of all but two FTSE 100 companies as shares rallied after it posted booming sales.\n\nShares in Arm were changing hands for more than $158 on Monday, up 33pc on its closing price on Friday, valuing the business at over $155bn (£123bn).\n\nThe jump in its valuation means Arm is now behind only Shell and AstraZeneca in the values of FTSE 100 companies, which are worth £162bn and £147bn respectively.\n\nArm’s stock has more than doubled so far this year as investors flock to the microchip designer and its value has soared 159pc since the company went public on New York’s Nasdaq exchange in September.\n\nThe company’s skyrocketing share price has seen its overall value climb above HSBC, Unilever and BP as investors buy into claims it stands to benefit from a groundswell of interest in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe Cambridge business, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange before it was taken private by Japan’s Softbank in 2016, designs critical technology used in billions of microchips - including smartphones and data centres.\n\nDespite efforts from Rishi Sunak to lure the business back to the Square Mile, Arm opted for a bumper New York float which valued the business at around $55bn.\n\nLast week, Arm reported an increase in revenues of 14pc to $824m. Rene Haas, Arm’s chief executive, told investors the company was seeing “strong momentum and tailwinds from all things AI”.\n\nTechnology shares in the US have driven the S&P 500 to record highs this year, prompting some analysts to warn of an AI-driven bubble.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia now have a combined market capitalisation of over $12 trillion.\n\nRichard Windsor, an independent analyst, said after Arm’s results the company had benefited from comparisons to US rival Nvidia, which would continue “as long as the AI bubble does not pop”. Nvidia overtook the value of Amazon on Monday with a price tag of $1.8 trillion.\n\nHe added: “The market loves anything that has exposure to the current frenzy.”",

The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on February 21, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $4.51, signifying a 412.5% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $20.18 billion, reflecting a 233.52% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 1.04% increase. At present, Nvidia boasts a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at valuation, Nvidia is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 35.62. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 26.52, so one might conclude that Nvidia is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that NVDA currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.64. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.72 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 197, finds itself in the bottom 22% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

Do we now.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: --for months, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: One thing, though, guys that I did bring with us today is a little bit more evidence that shows why we might broaden. Because I think that's one thing that I know. I've gotten into many conversations with strategists about and I'm sure you guys have too is, OK, so we're going to broaden, well, one of my first questions is always, when are we going to see it in earnings? We have to see it in earnings at some point to prove what we probably see in price reaction and Bank of America was out with an interesting note today.\n\nPointing out the difference in Mag Seven earnings expectations versus the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, and essentially pointing out, you can see here with your purple and blue lines, the purple line is the 493, the non Mag Seven stocks. The light blue line is the Mag Seven stocks. You can see in Q4 right now analyst projections are for the 493 to finally cross the Mag Seven and have higher year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nNow we could probably point to the fact that Mag Seven is going to have tough comps at that point in Q4 as far as your earnings growth goes. But we're seeing that gap really come closer together guys. And I think that's the big takeaway here. And B of A made the point that that might lead to some level of broadening or at least support that to see that. Because remember, we were looking at that one graph with big tech a couple of weeks ago before earnings, and it was just a massive dispersion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we're seeing that come away a little bit.\n\n- Yeah. When you talk to strategists, Josh, do they say, OK, well, if this rally is going to continue, it has to broaden?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: It seems like that at some point. Yes. At some point, strategists argue we would have to see more than basically at this point you could argue. It's for stocks driving us higher. But I think the main thing that most strategists are pointing out is it's probably not going to happen tomorrow and it might not even happen this month, Josh. I think a lot of people are highlighting-- Bank of America specifically highlighting June.\n\nA lot of people are talking that area of time because what do we think we're going to see in May or June? Probably a little bit more certainty around the Fed. That's becoming the consensus call. When we talk about broadening now is we still think it's going to happen, but we need the Fed to get out of the way first. And then we might see that broadening happen.\n\nSo a lot of people do think, if we're going to go significantly higher than where we're at now with 5,000, maybe there is some sort of consolidation. We sell off a little bit. And then you move higher once we get the Fed out of the way, so to speak in a better understanding of where they're headed.\n\n- Out of the way. That's what we're watching for. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Arm Holdings Plc soared again on Monday, extending a three-day rally that has driven its value up almost 100%, after a blockbuster earnings report last week showed artificial intelligence spending is bolstering sales.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nS&P 500 Rally Hits a Wall in Run-Up to CPI Report: Markets Wrap Pentagon Chief Austin in Critical Care for Bladder Issue Trump Asks Supreme Court to Keep DC Election Trial on Hold Trump Says There’s ‘No Way’ Taylor Swift Can Endorse Biden\n\nThe chip designer’s shares rose 29% on Monday to close at a record on volume that was more than 10 times the average over the past three months. The advance pushed the stock’s gains to more than 90% in the three trading sessions since Arm’s results were released after markets closed on Feb. 7.\n\n“What you’re seeing here is a feeding frenzy for anything to do with AI,” said Dennis Dick, trader at Triple D Trading. “Algos are getting involved, retail traders are getting involved, people are buying options. All that is just snowballing.”\n\nArm is benefiting from a push beyond smartphone technology, helping fuel growth and profitability. Last week, the company projected revenue of $850 million to $900 million for the March quarter, far surpassing the average analyst estimate at $778 million. Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas said opportunities presented by AI are still in the early stages.\n\nThe enthusiasm for the shares produced some noteworthy trading activity, with much of the gains arriving in just a few hours of trading. The shares topped out at nearly $127 within the first 36 minutes of trading on Feb. 8, and the latest session saw the bulk of the rally concentrated within the first 108 minutes of the day.\n\nThere’s some expectation that this advance could continue, with traders continuing to pay up for options, especially short-term calls protecting against further share gains. The most actively traded option was the $185 call expiring Friday, with more than 54,000 contracts changing hands. It traded last around $6 each. Based on the stock closing at $148.97, shares would need to gain another 28% by the end of the week for the contract be worth something at expiry.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far, Nvidia Corp. has been the biggest beneficiary of AI-driven demand for computing power. The chipmaker’s shares more than tripled last year amid a surge in revenue and profits related to sales of its so-called AI accelerator chips. Nvidia’s rally has continued this year, sending the stock up another 46% and briefly pushing its market value past that of Amazon.com Inc.\n\nArm and Nvidia were once destined to merge as part of a $40 billion deal announced in September 2020, but they ultimately dropped the plans. The merger faced opposition from the start with Arm’s own customers scorning the idea and regulators vowing to give it close scrutiny.\n\nArm has nearly tripled since its shares debuted in September and now has a market value of more than $150 billion, making it more valuable than Boeing Co. and AT&T Inc. The Cambridge, England-based company is still 90%-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the business in 2016 for $32 billion.\n\n“We’re getting to a point where it is moving parabolic, and that means serious market cap is being put in, because this was a fairly large company to begin with,” Dick said.\n\n--With assistance from Ian King, Ryan Vlastelica and David Marino.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan I Hire My Crush?

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The craze for artificial intelligence stocks sent options traders piling into bets on Arm Holdings on Monday, with many positioning for more gains in the shares after they almost doubled in price in less than a week.\n\nArm Holdings' shares are up 80% since Wednesday, after the company forecast better-than-expected quarterly results powered by demand for its technology to design chips for artificial intelligence features.\n\nThe jump in the stock price has ignited trading in the chip designer's options, with volume soaring to about 490,000 contracts a day over the last three sessions. That is more than 10 times the options' average daily trading volume in the month prior to the earnings report, according to Trade Alert data.\n\nThe exploding options volume pointed to investors hunting for the 'next NVIDIA,' said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, noting that the surge in bullish options activity was likely helping boost the stock.\n\nChip heavyweight Nvidia, at the center of the artificial intelligence frenzy, has risen about 220% over the last year, making it the best performing S&P 500 stock for that period.\n\nOn Monday, 600,000 Arm contracts changed hands by 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT), with the day's volume projected to hit a record 816,000 contracts, data showed.\n\nWith Arm shares up 20% at $137.72 on Monday, call options on the shares rising above $185 by Friday were the most actively traded Arm contracts. Call options convey the right to buy shares at a set price in the future, while puts offer the right to sell shares.\n\nArm's share price rise has made for massive gains for recent bullish options bets. For instance a trader who had bought about 5,000 of ARM January 2026 calls for about $12.2 million on Feb. 7, saw the value of those contracts jump to about $42 million, based on their last trading price, on Monday. Despite those gains, the trader appeared to be holding on to those call options, a bullish sign for the stock, Murphy said. ARM puts were also busy on Monday, possibly pointing to some investors looking to lock in some of the stocks' recent gains, he said.\n\nArm's technology is not directly used in the AI work, but companies like Nvidia are choosing it for central processing units that complement their AI-specific chips.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)",

Nvidia was up 0.1%, while Amazon dipped 1%.\n\n\"Earnings are coming in better than expected, the forecast for inflation continues to decline and the Fed is still likely to lower rates, Wall Street is having a hard time finding something to go wrong with the stock market rally,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\nTraders awaited January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) this week to gauge prospects for interest rate cuts this year. This week the market also gets data on industrial production, retail sales and preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment.\n\n\"An inflation number that's really hot might get some investors a bit nervous, but other than that the Fed is going to be in the same mode,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith data reflecting a robust economy, central bankers have shown less eagerness for early rate cuts. The odds for at least a 25-basis-point rate reduction in May have dropped to 52.2%, from over 95% at the start of 2024, as per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nAt 1:52 p.m., the S&P 500 gained 6.01 points, or 0.12%, to 5,032.62 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 12.13 points, or 0.08%, to 15,978.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.04 points, or 0.51%, to 38,867.73.\n\nThe small caps Russell 2000 index also surged 1.8%.\n\n\"Investors are rotating into those areas that have not kept pace with the broader market because that's possibly where there is greater value,\" said Stovall. \"Today could be sort of a bottom fishing day for the market.\"\n\nAmong other movers, Diamondback Energy jumped 9.2%, helping energy to top the 11 S&P 500 sectors with a 1.16% gain. Diamondback announced a $26-billion deal to buy the largest privately held oil and gas producer in the Permian basin, Endeavor Energy Partners.\n\nJoby Aviation gained 6.6% as the electric-powered aircraft maker signed an agreement to launch air taxi services in the United Arab Emirates by early 2026.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.3-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Shares of Arm Holdings surged more than 40% on Monday, adding to a staggering rally fueled by optimism around artificial intelligence.\n\nThe stock last traded up 21% at $139.65 after reaching as high as $164, 42% above its close on Friday.\n\nWith Monday's jump, Arm's shares have gained more than 80% since the British tech company last Wednesday became Wall Street's newest AI-related darling following a quarterly outlook that beat Wall Street's expectations.\n\nArm's stock market value has now reached a record $141 billion, nearly tripling since its initial public offering last September.\n\nAbout 10.5 million Arm shares, worth about $1.4 billion, have been sold short by traders betting the stock will fall, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics atS3 Partners, which tracks short sellers.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence Monday's stock surge is the result of a short squeeze, which occurs when short sellers rush to buy back shares in order to cover a potentially money-losing trade, Dusaniwsky said.\n\n\"Although there has been some short covering, the primary reason for the stock move is long share buying,\" Dusaniwsky said.\n\nThe recent spike in Arm's shares echoes sharp gains in Nvidia in May 2023 after the Silicon Valley chipmaker said AI computing was fueling massive demand for its chips.\n\nAfter Nvidia's stock market value more than tripled last year, on Monday it overtook Amazon.com as the U.S. stock market's fourth most valuable company, just behind Alphabet.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, only a fraction of Arm's shares are available for trading. Following its IPO, owner Softbank kept a 90.6% stake. The chip designer's 10 largest shareholders control almost 95% of its shares, according to LSEG data. That tiny supply of Arm shares available for trading may be contributing to the stock's recent surge.\n\nBy comparison, Nvidia's top 10 shareholders own about a third of the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoftbank could sell some of its Arm stake starting on March 12 after lock-up restrictions related to the IPO end.\n\nWith Monday's rally, Arm is trading at an exceedingly high 99 times expected earnings, even after analysts last week dramatically lifted their earnings estimates, according to LSEG data.\n\nNvidia's forward PE briefly hit 84 last June, but quickly fell as analysts raised their earnings estimates at a faster pace than the company's stock rally. Nvidia's stock is now valued at 34 times expected earnings.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Lance Tupper and Andrea Ricci)",

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Nvidia (NVDA)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Nvidia (NVDA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 39.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 64.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -2.8%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.95, which means that the company gets $0.95 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 54.7% this year versus the industry average of 3.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nvidia was up\n\n2.6%, while Amazon dipped 0.4%.\n\n\"A lot of people earlier in the year may have thought we were set for a bit of pullback in the semiconductor sector and it didn't happen, so it's certainly people saying, I don't want to miss the performance like I did last year,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.\n\nTraders await January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) this week to determine the timeline for monetary policy easing this year. Other data through the week also include industrial production, retail sales and preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment.\n\n\"An inflation number that's really hot might get some investors a bit nervous, but other than that the Fed is going to be in the same mode,\" Saluzzi added.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith growing data reflecting a robust economy, central bankers have effectively pushed back against traders' bets for early rate cuts. The odds for at least a 25-basis-point rate reduction in May have dropped to 55.8%, from over 95% at the start of 2024, as per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nRemarks from Federal Reserve officials including Richmond President Thomas Barkin and Minneapolis chief Neel Kashkari, scheduled through the day, will be scrutinized for any hints on the timing for rate cuts.\n\nAt 11:57 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 202.88 points, or 0.52%, at 38,874.57, the S&P 500 was up 19.56 points, or 0.39%, at 5,046.17, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 74.54 points, or 0.47%, at 16,065.20.\n\nThe small caps Russell 2000 index also surged 1.8%.\n\nAmong other movers, Diamondback Energy jumped 10.2%, helping energy to top the 11 S&P 500 sectors with a 1.0% gain, after announcing a $26-billion deal to buy the largest privately held oil and gas producer in the Permian basin, Endeavor Energy Partners.\n\nJoby Aviation gained 8.2% as the electric-powered aircraft maker signed an agreement to launch air taxi services in the Emirate by early 2026.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.45-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 149 new highs and 29 new lows.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best metaverse stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the metaverse, head directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe global metaverse market was valued at $98.7 billion in 2023, and it is anticipated to grow significantly, reaching $1,402.5 billion by 2032. IMARC Group predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.29% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse’s expansion. Tarik Chebib, Capital.com’s chief revenue officer, told Reuters:\n\n“The internet will end as we know it and the metaverse will totally reshape the global economy.”\n\nThe gaming industry, with its widespread use of alternative realities in games like Fortnite and Roblox, is poised to play a pivotal role in the metaverse, according to Tarik Chebib. Given the global user base of 3.2 billion gamers, there is substantial potential demand for the metaverse revolution. Furthermore, the gaming sector contributes valuable software expertise to serve as the foundation for metaverse development. The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion. Microsoft's leadership in the industry, particularly with titles like Minecraft, suggests a trend where other companies may follow suit. Chebib further commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Video games help us visualize what the metaverse could look like. Gaming companies are really interesting cases as they have already created worlds where people buy skins, avatars and collect different things.”\n\n2022 was expected to be the year of the metaverse, marked by Facebook's transformation to Meta in October 2021, reflecting Mark Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the potential of virtual and augmented reality. However, this did not materialize, and in 2023, the metaverse took a backseat to artificial intelligence. However, in 2024, there is potential for a metaverse resurgence in public attention as Apple launched its $3,500 Vision Pro headset, announced midway through 2023. Speculation suggests it could have a transformative impact on the metaverse similar to what the iPhone did for smartphones and the iPad did for portable tablet computing.\n\nSome of the best metaverse stocks to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe assessed the total holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:METV) and chose the top metaverse stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  13 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nPhoto by David Dvořáček on Unsplash\n\nBest Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a technology company facilitating digital payments globally for both merchants and consumers. On February 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.48 and a revenue of $8 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $130 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the number of payment transactions rose by 13%, reaching 6.8 billion, while the total payment transactions for the fiscal year 2023 increased by 12% to 25 billion. Despite that, active accounts decreased 2% year-over-year, amounting to 426 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 78 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $244 million.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.”\n\n12. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and supply of semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. On December 7, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $11.06 and a revenue of $9.3 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $20 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 87 hedge funds were long Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.70 billion.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”\n\n11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment company with three segments – Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences. On February 8, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) declared a $0.45 per share semi-annual dividend, a 50% increase from the prior dividend of $0.30. The dividend is payable on July 25, to shareholders of record as of July 8.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 89 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 92 funds in the preceding quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 32.8 million shares worth $2.66 billion.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”\n\n10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, and sale of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices globally. It is one of the top metaverse stocks to watch. On February 7, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a revenue of approximately NT$215.79 billion for January, showing a 7.9% increase from January 2023 and a 22.4% rise from December. TSMC also recently announced plans to construct a second chip fabrication facility in Japan in collaboration with Sony, Denso, Toyota, and the Japanese government.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 107 hedge funds were bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 121 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is a significant position holder in the company, with a stake worth $780.3 million.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was also a top contributor to performance. The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading “N3″ node. Nearly all of the Company’s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world’s most important and largest companies, but because the Company’s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%. Therefore, our growing position in these shares represent a significantly relatively overweight portfolio position versus our peers and benchmarks. We could not be more pleased by this anachronistic institutional imperative.”\n\n9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) offers technology infrastructure and marketing services to enable engagement between merchants, brands, and businesses with users and customers worldwide. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to buy. On February 7, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPADS of $2.67 and a revenue of $36.67 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.03 and $270 million, respectively. Alibaba announced that its board has authorized a $25 billion expansion of its stock buyback program until the end of March 2027. The company now has $35.3 billion remaining for share repurchases over the next three fiscal years.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 112 funds in the preceding quarter.\n\nL1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic data points began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this restructure will be a strong positive catalyst to unlock the sum-of-the-parts valuation upside in the company.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units, and other related products and services. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nOn February 1, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, projecting $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi analyst Christopher Danely suggested that AMD might be intentionally underestimating the revenue and there are indications that the actual figures could exceed the projections. Danely estimates that AMD might generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from the MI300, a product associated with artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 7th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. On December 18, Adobe and Figma jointly announced the cancellation of their $20 billion merger due to increasing regulatory challenges globally. The companies stated that they see no clear path to obtaining necessary approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. In light of the terminated deal, Adobe will pay Figma the agreed-upon $1 billion termination fee. Following this development, Barclays upgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock to Overweight, citing reduced concerns over dilution.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nApple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares valued at $156.75 billion.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 11 Best Small Cap Electric Vehicle Stocks to Invest In 26 Largest Mining Companies by Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. overtook Amazon.com Inc. in market value on Monday, the latest milestone in a stunning rally over the past year fueled by soaring demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPentagon Chief Austin in Critical Care for Bladder Issue Once-Bitten Europe Is Better Prepared for Trump’s NATO Tirades Trump Says There’s ‘No Way’ Taylor Swift Can Endorse Biden S&P 500 Keeps Rising to Defy Valuation Warnings: Markets Wrap\n\nNvidia rose as much as 2.9% on Monday, to reach a market value of about $1.83 trillion, topping Amazon at $1.80 trillion, according to Bloomberg data. The chipmaker is now the fourth most valuable US-listed company, sitting below Alphabet’s $1.85 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corp. weighs in at $3.11 trillion and Apple at $2.9 trillion.\n\nRead More: Nvidia Nears Amazon’s Market Value as Blazing Rally Drives Ahead\n\n“Amazon was actually among the winners in the current earnings season as Amazon’s outlook is improving,” said Saxo Bank’s Peter Garnry. “Nvidia is just riding the first investment wave of the current AI boom with massive capital expenditures being deployed in data centers.”\n\nAfter remaining range-bound in the second half of 2023, Nvidia’s shares have been on a tear in the new year, rising nearly 50% amid signs that demand remains strong for its chips used in data centers for complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Nvidia has added about $600 billion in market value so far this year, more than it gained in the last seven months of 2023.\n\nOf course, Amazon’s year is off to a good start as well. The e-commerce giant’s shares jumped 8% last week after reporting strong sales in the fourth quarter and giving a forecast for profitability that topped estimates. The rally briefly pushed Amazon’s market value above Alphabet’s.\n\nNvidia Corp. is the last of the tech giants to report earnings, which are due on Feb. 21.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCan I Hire My Crush?

Their shares were up 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.\n\nMegacaps with greater exposure to AI have spearheaded a Wall Street rally, also riding on hopes of imminent rate cuts and an upbeat outlook from businesses.\n\nThe latest milestone in a four-month rally among Wall Street's main indexes was the S&P 500 closing above the psychological 5,000-point level on Friday. The Nasdaq briefly surpassed the 16,000 mark for the second straight session on Monday, bringing it closer to its all-time high hit in November 2021.\n\n\"We are at hefty levels and the real question out there is how much longer can this market continue to rally without any new serious catalyst on the way,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.\n\n\"We'll begin to shift towards the macro news with CPI that could set the stage whether the market continues to rally.\"\n\nTraders await January's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) this week to determine the timeline for monetary policy easing this year. Other data through the week also include industrial production, retail sales and preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment.\n\nWith growing data reflecting a robust economy, central bankers have effectively pushed back against traders' bets for early rate cuts. The odds for at least a 25-basis-point rate reduction in May have dropped to 61%, from over 95% at the start of 2024, as per the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nRemarks from Federal Reserve officials including Richmond President Thomas Barkin and Minneapolis chief Neel Kashkari, scheduled through the day, will be scrutinized for any hints on the timing for rate cuts.\n\nAt 9:51 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.04 points, or 0.05%, at 38,692.73, the S&P 500 was up 1.20 points, or 0.02%, at 5,027.81, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 5.72 points, or 0.04%, at 15,996.38.\n\nAmong other movers, Diamondback Energy jumped 7%, helping energy to top the 11 S&P 500 sectors with a 0.8% gain, after announcing a $26-billion deal to buy the largest privately held oil and gas producer in the Permian basin, Endeavor Energy Partners.\n\nCitigroup slipped 0.8% after Reuters reported U.S. regulators have asked the lender for urgent changes to how it measures default risk of trading partners and its own auditors have found a plan to improve internal oversight to be lacking.\n\nJoby Aviation gained 3.5% as the electric-powered aircraft maker signed an agreement to launch air taxi services in the Emirate by early 2026.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.18-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 25 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 13 new lows.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Nvidia (NVDA): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.21, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.21 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 34 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.2% and 5.1% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $12.32.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look atJim Cramer's 11 Latest Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer examined the recent market movements during his program on CNBC on February 10. Cramer said the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks. Cramer said this hasn’t happened since 1972.  He thinks amid strong earnings and rate cuts on the horizon, investors have learned that you are much better off \"owning stocks\" instead of trading them. Cramer said he's long been a believer of owning stocks and holding them for long periods of time. Cramer talked about the recent market rally and said it would take something really \"nasty\" to stop this rally.\n\nWhat is the Best Time to Buy Stocks?\n\nCramer said the best time to own stocks is between the Fed's last rate hike and the first cut. Cramer said that it would make sense for the Fed to postpone rate cuts amid inflation and investors can skill take benefit from strong earnings and rally in stocks.\n\n\"Authentic Stupidity\"\n\nCramer recently also talked about a trend which he calls \"authentic stupidity\" where some stocks that should go higher are either going down or unable to realize their true potential. Cramer believes Apple is one of the victims of this authentic stupidity. Cramer quoted a \"nameless analyst\" from DA Davidson who in January gave a $166 price target to Apple and a Neutral rating, citing lack of innovation. Cramer said the same analyst, after the launch of Apple's Vision Pro, upped his price target on Apple shares to $200 and said \"game changing innovation is back.\" Jim Cramer's Latest Stock Picks\n\nEveryone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap quality tech stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But what are his latest stock picks? For this article we watched Cramer's latest programs and picked some new stocks on the analyst's radar. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nJim Cramer believes Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH), which is down about 42% over the past one year, might finally be bottoming. Cramer said Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH) suffered because of rising interest rates since the residential solar industry was highly reliant on financing. Cramer quoted Enphase Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH) CEO Badri Kothandaraman who recently said in Enphase Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH) fourth quarter earnings call that things are expected to start turning around for Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH) in the first quarter.\n\nCramer specifically highlighted the following comments of the CEO:\n\n\"We think Q1 could be the bottom quarter. Europe is already showing early signs of recovery, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back quickly.\"\n\nEnphase also talked about Q1 guidance during its call:\n\n\"Let’s now come to our Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $260 million to $300 million. We expect the sell-through of our products to be seasonally down in Q1. We plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximately $130 million in Q1. We are forecasting to undership in Q2 as well, although at a much reduced level, and expect the channel to be normalized by the end of Q2. Let’s talk about new products, starting with IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been increasing steadily over the last few quarters. Our third-generation battery delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery today at a 15-year industry-leading warranty. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well positioned to grow our battery sales in 2024.\"\n\nYou can read the entire earnings call transcript of Enphase by clicking here.\n\n10. Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 49\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on asset management and financial services company Oxford Lane Capital Corp (NASDAQ:OXLC). Cramer advised against buying the stock as he said we don’t know \"what they own.\" Cramer said he likes \"the concept\" of the industry and in this regard recommended investors to buy Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) instead.\n\n\"They really know how to do it,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX). The biggest stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) is owned by Thomas Steyer's Farallon Capital which owns a $239 million stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Brookfield because we believe both companies are likely to increase market share in a secular growth opportunity for alternative assets.\n\nInstitutional allocations to alternative investment assets such as real estate, infrastructure, and private equity are likely to continue to grow significantly in the years ahead because alternatives have a long track record of generating attractive relative and absolute returns with less volatility than several other investment options.\n\nWe are bullish on the long-term prospects for Blackstone and Brookfield. Both companies are led by exceptional management teams that attract and retain exceptional talent. They are two of the largest real estate managers in the world with impressive investment track records. Both Blackstone and Brookfield have global franchises, strong brands, and loyal customers.\n\nWe believe the shares of both companies are attractively valued and are optimistic about the long-term potential for the Fund’s investments in both companies.”\n\n9.

(NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.”\n\n6. Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 63\n\nJim Cramer was asked about his thoughts on home construction company Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) in a latest program.

        "title": "Upstart Holdings (UPST) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Upstart Holdings UPST is slated to report fourth-quarter 2023 results after market close on Feb 13.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues of approximately $135 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $135.3 million, suggesting a decline of 7.9% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark is pegged at a loss of 15 cents per share, suggesting a significant improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 25 cents.\n\nUPST’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 35.2%.\n\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\n\nUpstart Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nUpstart Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Upstart Holdings, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nDegradation in the macro environment, conservative assumption for Upstart Macro Index in loan pricing, seasonal headwinds and tightening from funding partners are expected to have hurt the top line in the quarter under discussion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from fees is pegged at $150 million, indicating a 3.8% decline from the year-ago quarter.\n\nConsumer delinquencies are elevated, and funding markets remain limited in their appetite for risk. This is expected to have increased loan pricing in the company’s platform and lowered approval rates for loan applicants, thus reducing transaction volume and affecting the top line.\n\nHowever, Upstart’s fourth-quarter results are likely to gain from its strategy to operate as a multiproduct company. Recent launches across its product portfolio powered by generative AI and machine learning may have favored UPST’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMoreover, the company is expected to have gained from a growing partner base in the fourth quarter. It is engaged with multiple prospective partners who are actively exploring long-term capital relationships.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Upstart this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.\n\nStory continues\n\nUPST currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -9.59%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Akamai Technologies AKAM and Block SQ have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.26%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 21. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.51 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 412.5%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $20.18 billion, calling for a year-over-year rise of 233.5%.\n\nAkamai is slated to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 13. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.61% at present. Akamai’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.59 per share, suggesting an increase of 16.1% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.37. Akamai’s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 7.5% to $997.6 million.\n\nBlock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters while missing on one occasion, with the average surprise being 11%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block’s fourth-quarter earnings stands at 60 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 172.7%. It is estimated to report revenues of $5.69 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 22.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nasdaq Composite Back in Action: 5 Top Picks",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. — the world's largest contract chipmaker — recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nFuture Catalyst\n\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\n\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration’s R&D efforts.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoth with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in he last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance.\n\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\n\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Twilio (TWLO) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?",
        "content": "Twilio Inc. TWLO is slated to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 14.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues stands at $1.04 billion, indicating a marginal improvement of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $1.02 billion.\n\nTwilio anticipates non-GAAP earnings between 53 cents and 57 cents per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 57 cents per share, suggesting a strong 159.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 22 cents per share.\n\nTwilio’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 157.8%.\n\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nTwilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nTwilio Inc. price-eps-surprise | Twilio Inc. Quote\n\nFactors at Play\n\nTwilio’s fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from continued digital transformation initiatives as organizations continue to reconfigure their setup for a hybrid operational environment. The strong uptake of Segment, the growing adoption of Twilio Flex and an increasing clientele base are likely to have favored the fourth-quarter performance.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, Twilio added around 2,000 new clients, taking the total active customer count to 306,000 as of Sep 30, 2023. In the fourth quarter, the company’s increasing scope among leading enterprises is likely to have acted as a key tailwind.\n\nSolutions like Twilio Conversations, SendGrid Ads and SendGrid’s Email Validation application programming interface are likely to have contributed to the fourth-quarter performance. The company’s efforts to fortify its global footprint are likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter's results.\n\nHowever, softening IT spending as customers are pushing or postponing their large IT investment plans in the ongoing uncertain macroeconomic environment and geopolitical issues are likely to have weighed on the to-be-reported quarter’s top line.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, Twilio’s bottom line is likely to have benefited from its cost-saving initiatives, which include headcount reduction and the closure of several offices. The company ended the third quarter with 5,905 employees, down from the previous quarter’s 6,428 staff and the year-ago quarter’s 8,992 personnel.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Twilio this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for the Upcoming AI Wars",
        "content": "Last month, the writers at InvestorPlace.com and I recommended four stocks to buy for the coming “AI Wars.” Governments worldwide know that artificial intelligence has incredible potential, and everyone is racing to come out ahead.\n\nThe United Kingdom has promised to pour $1.3 billion over the next five years into AI and supercomputing, while China will put in double that amount. If you include government subsidies of chip factories (the most capital-intensive part of AI investment), roughly $120 billion has now been pledged.\n\nWe’re already seeing the effects of this new AI nationalism. Since January, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) — one of the four stocks we highlighted last week — have surged 45% on strong fourth-quarter earnings. The secretive company specializes in helping corporations and governments eke out AI-driven insights from mounds of data. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of Louis Navellier’s top picks, has risen 45% since the start of the year after tripling the prices of its AI-focused H100 flagship processors. U.K.-based AI chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is up almost 60% after earnings… the list goes on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, these companies are raising prices and creating monopolies… and governments are happy to allow it.\n\nOf course, some AI stocks will take time to play out. Last Friday, shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (another of our four picks from last week) fell 12% after the chipmaker announced a weaker-than-expected forecast. It will likely take one or two more years for Intel to see the benefits of the billion-dollar subsidies the U.S. government is providing.\n\nNevertheless, this much is clear: When governments and investors all want a sector to succeed, the combination of supporting tariffs, subsidies and lax regulation can often make it so. We’ve seen this before in other industries… from shale oil and gas drilling in the Dakotas to electric vehicle production in China’s Anhui province. Once a state begins putting its thumb on the scale, those favored industries have little choice but to succeed.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis week, Luke Lango reveals another group of stocks in The AI Endgame. During that event, Luke will tell us all about the final phase of the AI Revolution, which could send several unknown stocks soaring to new heights… while simultaneously erasing thousands of stocks from the markets. You can sign up to reserve your spot for that event — Tuesday, Feb. 13, at 8 p.m. Eastern — here.\n\nAnd in the meantime, our writers here at InvestorPlace.com have chosen three blue-chip stocks to help keep you ahead as these AI Wars continue to escalate.\n\n3 Blue Chip AI Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerhaps the clearest potential winner of AI nationalism will be Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google. The company launched its answer to OpenAI’s ChatGPT on Wednesday, and our initial tests suggest it’s even better than GPT-4.\n\nThis comes as much-needed good news for the search giant. Digital ad revenues have been slowing for years, and Google has become increasingly reliant on its cloud computing business for growth. A strong showing by its new AI product — Google Gemini — will help it push past rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It’s one of the reasons why David Moadel, one of InvestorPlace’s top contributors, believes that Alphabet is a Mag 7 bargain:\n\n“There no denying that Alphabet is committed to developing the latest and greatest in AI tech… [and] agree with Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali, who asserts that Alphabet “remains at the forefront of the AI race.” All three of the analysts mentioned here assigned a “buy” rating to GOOG/GOOGL stock.\n\n“My forecast GOOG stock is 100% bullish and I encourage investors to grab some shares before the next long-term rally commences.”\n\nAI nationalism is also particularly important for Alphabet because it has the most to gain from lax regulation. Google has the broadest access to online data of any major tech firm, having indexed the web for the past 25 years. Many publishers also give Google the ability to “crawl” content behind paywalled sites — a privilege that virtually no other firm has.\n\nThat makes Google the most likely company to beat ChatGPT — provided it can use the data it’s collected. Studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) continue improving as more training data is added. So, a hands-off approach by regulators will be essential to helping Google win.\n\nOf course, other American blue-chips will also benefit from favorable regulation. Export restrictions to China will eventually turn into import restrictions, protecting companies like Nvidia from cheaper Chinese rivals. Microsoft and Amazon will both find themselves protected from trustbusters because regulators recognize that AI is only as good as the massive amounts of data it hoovers up.\n\nBut AI will benefit Google the most, given the company’s awkward reliance on a slowing search business and the amount of data it has. Alphabet is also the cheapest of the Magnificent 7 stocks, trading at only 21 times forward earnings. If the company manages to beat OpenAI, a renewed surge of growth gives the search giant a 50% to 60% upside from here.\n\n2. ASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nLast year was a tough time to own ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the world’s only producer of advanced chipmaking machinery. The Netherlands-based company had found itself caught in the China-U.S. fight over chip export restrictions, and shares lost as much as 25% going into the fall. Regulators knew that ASML served as the lynchpin of advanced semiconductor manufacturing, so they banned sales of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) chipmaking machinery to kneecap China’s growing chipmaking business.\n\nHowever, Western governments have since realized that choking off ASML’s business entirely is a bad idea. Roughly a quarter of ASML’s total operating costs come from its R&D department, and ASML needs to keep innovating to stay ahead of the competition. Subsequent export restrictions have since been watered down to include only the latest models.\n\nThat’s had a predictable effect on earnings estimates and share prices. Analysts have been nudging their 2024-2025 estimates up across the board, and shares have risen over 50% since October. It’s why InvestorPlace.com’s Chris MacDonald continues to recommend shares of this impressive firm.\n\n“ASML’s top position in EUV technology is critical for semiconductor advancement, especially in advanced memory solutions. CEO Peter Wennink maintained a humble outlook despite positive signs of a 2024 revenue similar to the previous year. The company sets eyes for significant growth in 2025.”\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany Chinese firms will win thanks to AI nationalism. The Chinese government has a $40 billion state fund to boost the semiconductor industry, and dozens of chipmaking firms have sprung up to take advantage of the handouts. Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Nexchip Semiconductor and United Nova are among these names.\n\nHowever, the “safest” of Chinese AI plays is most likely Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), a monopolistic software giant with few strong competitors. Unlike Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Tencent has remained on the right side of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Its CEO has never “disappeared” for months on end. And Tencent has been far better managed than Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China’s top search-engine company, which failed to recognize opportunities in cloud computing. Tencent has masterfully navigated M&A deals across the greater China region, earning north of 20% returns.\n\nMost importantly, Tencent has no stake in the cut-throat world of semiconductor manufacturing. The company focuses on mobile games, online chat, enterprise businesses, music streaming and other high-margin tech services that AI will make even more profitable. Analysts expect the firm to earn 30% operating margins going into 2024. (SMIC, by comparison, barely covers its cost of capital.)\n\nThe Chinese tech giant also has significant exposure to cloud computing, business services, and fintech, which fits neatly into its AI ambitions. In 2022, this segment eclipsed its gaming sales, and analysts see this as a significant growth area for the next several years. Josh Enomoto at InvestorPlace.com sees at least 34% upside from current prices, while a successful pivot to AI would mean even more.\n\nOf course, Tencent comes with the broader risks of buying Chinese stocks. The country has recently seen an exodus of investors, driven out by fears of real estate contagion and a rapidly decelerating economy. The tech firm also remains beholden to the whims of the CCP; in December, Tencent’s shares fell double-digits after Chinese regulators announced a wide range of rules aimed at curbing spending on video games. (The CCP would later fire a top government official over the resulting market meltdown, sending Tencent’s shares back up.)\n\nStill, Paul La Monica sees this most recent drawdown as an opportunity to buy Chinese shares cheaply. He notes that insiders have recently snapped up shares.\n\n“The reported stock purchases by Ma and Tsai are certainly a sign of confidence and could suggest that Alibaba and the overall Chinese stock market have bottomed. Investors are also growing increasingly optimistic about the possibility of more stimulus from Beijing. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that a nearly $280 billion market stabilization package is in the works, where state-owned financial companies would buy up local shares of Chinese stocks.”\n\nAnd now that even Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to calm investors, this likely marks as the best time in years to buy shares of Tencent.\n\nThe New AI Wars\n\nSo far, we’ve talked about the large companies helped by direct government intervention. These are essentially the equivalent of the South Korean family-run conglomerates (chaebol), or the eight conglomerates of Japan. Dependable and protected… but with somewhat limited upside because of their size.\n\nMeanwhile, Luke has ventured further to find the secondary winners of this new AI reality. Though his research, he’s found incredible growth companies that are leading innovation, even without much government help. Many of these firms could even rival the big players someday. And to get you started, Luke releases a new report this week that outlines five 1,000% winners for The AI Endgame.

        "content": "In the dynamic stock market realm, tech stocks to buy have consistently been the beacon leading the charge for all-time highs, underpinning the sector’s long-term growth potential. Despite the unsettling layoffs, this period harbors a silver lining for discerning investors. Historically, tech sector downturns have unveiled lucrative long-term buying opportunities, a trend likely to spill over into 2024. Layoffs, while often viewed through a grim lens, can efficiently catalyze a company’s evolution towards streamlined operations, heightened efficiencies, and a clear focus. For tech entities, this process is not just about slashing costs but enhancing value-added and per-capita effectiveness, setting the stage for sustainable success. Amidst this backdrop, certain tech stocks emerge as compelling investments, promising revitalized frameworks and potentially elevated valuations in the wake of downsizing.\n\nTech Stocks To Buy: Apple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 18.3%\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent journey through turbulent times, marked by dropping iPhone sales within the key Chinese market, has cast a shadow over its ubiquitous dominance. The fourth-quarter results showed a 13% dip in iPhone sales across China, exacerbating concerns among investors and stakeholders. Yet, it’s imperative to recognize that this setback is part of a broader narrative that doesn’t undermine Apple’s inherent value and many opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn dissecting Apple’s situation, it’s critical to acknowledge the resilience and adaptability that has become synonymous with its brand. Despite the slowdown in hardware sales, Apple’s services segment has emerged as a powerful counterbalance, demonstrating stellar growth and compensating for any perceived shortcomings in device sales. Furthermore, Apple’s capacity to exceed Wall Street’s top and bottom-line expectations amidst these challenges underscores its operational ability and market understanding. Furthermore, the introduction of Apple Vision Pro, hailed by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives as a potential “game-changer,” is poised to invigorate Apple’s product lineup. With an anticipated sale of 600,000 units in 2024, Apple Vision Pro is a testament to Apple’s innovative spirit.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 12.6%\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), Google’s parent company, exemplifies the virtue of patience fused with its persistent innovation, especially in the fast-evolving artificial intelligence (AI) realm. While the AI fervor escalates, Google has been comfortably exceeding expectations, leveraging YouTube’s advertising potential that many have long awaited. The video-sharing giant is refining its monetization tactics, implementing key measures including blocking ad blockers and rolling out premium features, strategies which are beginning to bear fruit. Coupled with Google Search, YouTube is crafting a competitive edge, positioning Alphabet towards sustainable, double-digit growth.\n\nThe figures are telling: Alphabet’s sales soared to $307.4 billion, a commendable 10% year-over-year (YOY) bump, with YouTube’s $9.2 billion contribution last quarter underscoring the promise of this platform. Furthermore, Alphabet’s recent unveiling of the Gemini AI upgrade signals its intent to compete head-on with OpenAI’s breakthroughs. By harnessing its expansive data across a myriad of domains, Alphabet is effectively positioning itself to maximize AI monetization.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 12.8%\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a standout performer in the competitive semiconductor realm, boasting more than 90% in stock value in the past year. This growth titan delivered another strong quarter of sales increase, an 11% increase from the prior year, beating estimates by $60 million.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s forward-looking stance is evidenced by its ambitious projection of $3.5 billion in data center revenue this year, which marks a substantial 75% jump from its earlier $2 billion forecast. Its data center revenue in the last quarter alone increased by 38% YOY, bolstered by a remarkable quarterly bump of 43%. This surge stems from its triumph in CPU and data center GPU revenues, surpassing expectations, thanks partly to the new AI-focused MI300X GPU. This innovative chip is quickly gaining traction, poised to snatch market share from the current leader, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with its superior speed, efficiency and robust pricing strategy.\n\nIBM (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 17.6%\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is showcasing its prowess in AI and strategic innovation, ushering in a new era of growth and tech leadership. The tech giant is providing a bullish 2024 top-line expansion guidance of roughly 5%, excluding currency fluctuations, a figure that comfortably surpasses analysts’ average expectations. IBM underscores its forward-looking stance in the tech sphere. This optimistic projection is bolstered by an anticipated impressive free cash flow of about $12 billion for the year.\n\nThe deployment of AI systems across IBM’s customer base is pushing for the increased demand for both its software and services, illustrating the transformative impact of AI on the tech sector. CEO Arvind Krishna’s revelation, which shows that IBM’s AI-related pipeline had doubled from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, further emphasizes the company’s dynamic engagement with AI technologies. Moreover, its strategic focus on hybrid cloud, security, AI, and quantum computing, highlighted by the unveiling of its 433-qubit Osprey processor, positions it uniquely in the tech domain.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 7%\n\nNetflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) journey post-pandemic epitomizes its robust position in the streaming market. Amid initial setbacks, including subscriber declines which cast doubts on its growth trajectory, Netflix has pivoted remarkably, showcasing a compelling resurgence. This turnaround is a testament to the company’s adeptness in navigating the competitive streaming landscape, where it continues to assert its dominance.\n\nThe secret to Netflix’s sustained momentum lies in its commitment to enriching its content library, a diverse mix that spans various genres and languages, appealing to a global audience. The record addition of 13.1 million global streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter alone, significantly up from 7.7 million in the same quarter the previous year, emphasizes the platform’s unparalleled appeal and market penetration. Closing 2023 with a staggering 260 million paid memberships and reporting a vigorous 12.5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, Netflix’s trajectory is on an extraordinary upswing.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 35.2%\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) stands as a true titan in the fintech landscape, navigating past challenges to effectively position itself on the cusp of robust growth, thanks to the industry’s explosive expansion. This fintech has captured the attention with its latest ventures into self-custody wallets and a Web5 toolkit, setting new benchmarks in decentralized app development. These innovations effectively diversify Block’s portfolio as it stands as a true juggernaut in the fintech sphere, ensuring its competitive edge remains sharp in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nFinancially, Block has demonstrated resilience and strength, with third-quarter GAAP earnings per share surpassing expectations by six cents. This performance, coupled with a significant 24.3% YOY revenue increase to $5.62 billion, exceeded forecasts by $190 million, highlighting a robust upward financial trajectory. Block’s strategic foray into various fintech domains, including digital payments and cryptocurrency, positions it advantageously in the financial ecosystem. The company’s broadening product portfolio and proactive market engagement signal a well-crafted strategy to leverage emerging trends.\n\nT-Mobile US (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 10.1%\n\nT-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a standout performer among the leading 5G wireless carriers, showcasing unparalleled performance over the past year. In 2023, the carrier’s strategic moves paid off incredibly, with an impressive addition of 1.3 million postpaid accounts. Moreover, its fourth-quarter report highlighted that its Ultra Capacity 5G network covers approximately 300 million Americans, equating to 98% of the U.S. population.\n\nFurthermore, T-Mobile’s prowess is equally impressive. The company reported an adjusted 2023 free cash flow of $13.59 billion, an amazing 77% bump from the previous year, translating to a healthy % free cash flow yield of 4.5%. Beyond the numbers, T-Mobile’s strategy of bolstering its presence in stadiums and entertainment venues significantly enhances its brand visibility. Its strategic initiatives have fostered a bullish sentiment among analysts, with Tipranks analysts rating TMUS stock as a ‘strong buy.’ The anticipated 14% bump in value, with a 12-month forecast price of $204, underscores the confidence in T-Mobile’s trajectory as a leading stock within the 5G technology sphere.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "\"A few good ideas is all you need. And when you find the few, you have to act aggressively. That's the Munger system.\"-Charlie Munger\n\nBoom! $150,000 lands in your pocket out of nowhere.\n\nWhat would you do? Buy a new car? Embark on the vacation of a lifetime? Renovate your home?\n\nIf I were to find myself in such a hypothetical scenario, I know what I would do: I'd follow Charlie Munger's advice and invest it -- perhaps $50,000 each into three stocks. Maybe it would go something like this: Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Visa\n\nFirst up is Visa (NYSE: V), the world's largest payment-processing company.\n\nNotice that I called Visa a payment-processing company rather than a credit card company. That's because Visa doesn't issue credit or debit cards. Indeed, contrary to popular belief, Visa doesn't offer customers credit, set rates, or charge fees. Instead, Visa partners with financial institutions like banks and credit unions by offering access to the Visa-branded payment network (for a fee).\n\nThat's a key distinction, as Visa has no credit risk. It also means the company's revenue is largely tied to the volume of payments and transactions on its network.\n\nAt any rate, Visa's no-nonsense business model has delivered exceptional shareholder gains. Over the last decade, Visa's stock has generated an annualized total return (price appreciation plus dividend payments) of 18.4%. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nThat means $50,000 invested in Visa 10 years ago would be worth $271,000 today -- not too shabby. However, I also have my eye on some spicier picks.\n\n2. CrowdStrike\n\nNext up is a younger, faster-growing company. It's CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), a leader in AI-driven cybersecurity solutions. While I value Visa for its steady growth, CrowdStrike is all about potential.\n\nThe company is growing revenue at a 35% year-over-year rate as of its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Oct. 31, 2023). Moreover, the overall cybersecurity market that CrowdStrike aims to satisfy is growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, that's because cybercrime is booming. Hackers -- seeking money, political retribution, or chaos -- are running amok right now. Large organizations, ranging from large-cap corporations to governments and non-profits, are all scrambling to protect their networks, harden their defenses, and safeguard their data.\n\nMore to the point, some analysts expect the cybersecurity market to grow by 50% to $274 billion by 2028 -- presenting a significant opportunity for cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike.\n\nAt any rate, CrowdStrike's stock has rewarded investors since its debut in 2019. Its total return since then is more than 423% or almost 43% annually.\n\nIn other words, $50,000 invested in CrowdStrike's Initial Public Offering (IPO) on June 12, 2019, would be worth $260,000 as of the time of this writing.  CRWD Total Return Level Chart\n\nThat's an impressive return, and if CrowdStrike shares grow at that rate over the next decade, my hypothetical portfolio would be well on its way to $1 million.\n\nHowever, I still have one final pick to make.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nLast, we arrive at Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). In my opinion, no other stock can match Nvidia's combination of actual results and potential.\n\nAs for the results, they're plain to see. MetaPlatforms, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and many others are buying all the Nvidia AI chips they can get their hands on. And yet, the demand seems insatiable because the world can't get enough of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFor his part, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jensen Huang put it this way: \"For the very first time, because of generative AI, computer technology is going to impact literally every single industry and every single country.\"\n\nSo, given the massive demand for AI chips, it should come as no surprise that Nvidia has been one of the best stocks to own over the last 10 years.\n\nIndeed, a $50,000 investment made in Nvidia shares 10 years ago would now be worth an astronomical $9.2 million as of this writing. NVDA Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt's hard to believe that a similar return is possible for Nvidia shares over the next 10 years, but no one really knows.\n\nOne thing is certain: The world is desperate for more AI products, which means more AI chips. Nvidia is currently the market leader, but others, like AMD and Intel, want to catch up. Moreover, some big tech names like Alphabet and Apple are developing their own AI chips, given the lucrative nature of the market.\n\nStill, Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from the surge in AI demand for many years. And that's why it gains the final place in my hypothetical portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Gaming Was Nvidia's Largest Business. Now, 80% of Its Revenue Comes From Somewhere Else Entirely",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) inception aimed to revolutionize 3D computer graphics for gaming and multimedia sectors. Initially achieving success with various chips, the company made a significant leap in 1999 with the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce 256, the world's first graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nThis milestone had culminated in the latest GeForce RTX 40 Series, which can deliver life-like graphics to digital content with the help of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), an incredible innovation by Nvidia. DLSS uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create additional frames in a video game scene and enhance image quality.\n\nUntil fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022), gaming was routinely Nvidia's largest revenue driver. The segment generated $12.5 billion in sales that year, which accounted for 46% of the company's total revenue. But then, everything changed: Data source: Nvidia. Chart by The Motley Fool.\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the data center\n\nData centers used to be where companies stored valuable information, but have since evolved to become centralized hubs for online operations (otherwise known as cloud computing). Today, data centers are home to powerful chips designed by Nvidia to process AI workloads.\n\nThe shift began in 2016 when Nvidia delivered the first AI supercomputer to OpenAI, which it used to develop the early generative AI models that culminated in the famous ChatGPT online chatbot.\n\nNow, Nvidia's leading H100 data center GPUs sell for up to $40,000 a pop. With centralized data center operators like Microsoft and Amazon ordering hundreds of thousands of them to give cloud customers the computing power they need to develop AI.\n\nIt sent Nvidia's data center revenue soaring 279% year over year in the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023). The data center segment now accounts for 80% of Nvidia's total revenue, leaving the gaming segment in the dust.\n\nNvidia is now a $1.8 trillion behemoth, and $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone. The good news is that Nvidia stock could probably still go higher from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Now Worth More Than Berkshire Hathaway, Tesla, and AMD Combined. But Will It Last?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the best-performing stock in the entire S&P 500 last year. As of Feb. 7, it is also the best-performing stock so far this year.\n\nAt first glance, this accomplishment sounds like Nvidia simply sustained its momentum when the calendar year flipped, which it did. But keep in mind that Nvidia, like the rest of the S&P 500, had a 0% year-to-date performance on the morning of Jan. 1. After surging by 238.9% in 2023, Nvidia is already up an additional 41.6% in 2024. Put another way, it is up 379.7% since Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nI have never seen a company the size of Nvidia follow up a banner year with such a swift and sudden spike. In fact, Nvidia is now worth more than Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, electric vehicle leader Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and its fellow semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices -- combined.\n\nBut for those considering adding Nvidia to their portfolios now, the real questions are whether the growth stock can continue its rally and whether it's worth buying at today's levels. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's surge has been nothing short of historic\n\nThe only price move that I can think of that comes anything close to what we are seeing with Nvidia is what Tesla did in 2020, when it gained 743.4% in a single calendar year, boosting its market cap from $75.5 billion to $677.4 billion.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has topped even Tesla in terms of value creation. At the end of 2022, Nvidia had a market cap of $359.5 billion. As of Feb. 7, Nvidia's market cap is $1.73 trillion. So, in a little over 13 months, Nvidia added $1.37 trillion to its market cap, roughly double what Tesla did in a similar time.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that Nvidia's combination of percentage gain and market cap gain is changing the market. Nvidia now accounts for 4.1% of the value of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, an ETF that mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. It's also 5% of the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. Every time someone buys $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, they are also investing $400 in Nvidia. That's a big deal, and it's contributing to making the market more tech-heavy than ever before.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe pitfalls of becoming a \"story stock\"\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia's business is putting up phenomenal numbers. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIts top- and bottom-line growth is extraordinary. Its operating margin is also incredibly high, as Nvidia is pocketing 46 cents in operating income from each dollar in sales. Investors think the performance will improve, as customers can't get enough of Nvidia's products to power their artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations.\n\nThe danger for Nvidia isn't how the business is doing -- it's the pressure that investors are putting on the stock. The higher Nvidia goes before the fundamentals can catch up to the valuation, the greater the risk that Nvidia becomes a \"story stock.\" With a 92.6 price-to-earnings ratio, some may argue it already is one.\n\nA story stock is a company whose valuation is based entirely on a story, or what it could become in the future rather than what it is today. Tesla did this in 2020 when it posted the incredible 743% return mentioned earlier. But Tesla largely lived up to the hype, as its revenue and bottom-line growth have been incredibly strong. Sure, the business has slowed recently. But overall, it has been an impressive period for Tesla, the company.\n\nTesla the stock, however, is actually down by more than 20% from where it traded at the end of 2020. TSLA Chart\n\nThe stock's more recent underperformance is largely because investors were willing to pay such a high price for Tesla before it delivered its stunning results. When Tesla did that in 2021, 2022, and 2023, investors had already priced that progress in. I fear the same dynamic may play out with Nvidia.\n\nTesla is a perfect example of how a business can deliver excellent results at the same time as its stock is performing poorly, simply because the stock price previously got too far ahead of itself.\n\nA simple and relatively safe way to invest in Nvidia\n\nThe tailwinds for Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor industry are stronger than ever. It's just that Nvidia stock is, at least for now, priced for perfection. But that doesn't mean it should be avoided altogether.\n\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: VUG) is well-suited for investors who feel like they've been caught flat-footed while the AI ascension has zoomed past them. Nvidia makes up 5.3% of the ETF -- a sizable position, but not enough to make or break its performance. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- comprise over 50% of the fund.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Vanguard Growth ETF is at an all-time high, and the valuations of its top components have gotten much more expensive. But for just a 0.04% expense ratio, or 4 cents for every $100 invested, an investor can get exposure to a lot of megacap growth names, including Nvidia. It's a good way to get a starter position in Nvidia without overly committing.\n\nHit the pause button on Nvidia\n\nAt this point, I don't think investors have to fear Nvidia stock will run away from them. In many ways, its big gains are behind it; it's too late to buy Nvidia if you were looking to nearly 5x your money in a little over a year. Aside from getting limited exposure with the Vanguard Growth ETF or a similar fund, I think the best way to approach Nvidia now would be to simply hit the pause button and wait.\n\nIf the company's fundamentals have improved a year or two from now, but the stock price has languished, then Nvidia will be a far better value (and probably a strong buy). But for now, so many expectations have been pulled forward, leaving too much hot air and room for the stock to fall.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AI Stock Alert: Why Smart Investors Need to Be Cautious With C3.ai in 2024",
        "content": "Any AI stock forecast has to consider that the space had a fantastic year last year but 2024 is starting off as a bit of a mixed bag. While the industry leaders are off to the races again, smaller AI stocks trying to establish themselves are having a slow start. Put C3.ai (NYSE:AI) in the latter category.\n\nAfter surging 170% in value in 2023, AI stock is down 6.5% in the new year. The AI software platform’s last earnings report showed the potential C3.Ai has but also the problem it faces. That’s why my AI stock forecast says becoming profitable could be the biggest hurdle it faces.\n\nAI Stock Forecast: A Reassessment\n\nThe market is rewarding AI stocks that offer investors both revenue growth and profits. Although the industry is still in its infancy and has a long runway ahead, investors are already becoming choosy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThink of last year as the euphoria of discovery of a new market opportunity. Money poured into any stock with the most tangential relationship to AI. Many companies tried to associate themselves as “AI stocks” by simply incorporating AI into their apps. This year investors sobered up.\n\nThey are still rewarding companies with a proven track record like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and C3.ai competitor Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) but are withholding judgment on others. C3.ai may have the most to prove.\n\nProfits Tomorrow\n\nIn all frankness, the enterprise AI platform keeps pushing its promise of profitability further into the future. The timeline for non-GAAP profits shifted from 2024 to a window between Q2 and Q4 of 2025. In December that was nudged further back into the second half of 2025. Don’t be surprised if investors are told next quarter to wait until FY2026 for profits to materialize.\n\nWorse, losses are growing too. C3.ai updated its guidance last quarter to full-year losses of $125 million at the midpoint of its range. That’s nearly triple last year’s losses. Mounting losses and ephemeral promises of profitability are worrisome for the AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the surface, the rationale seems reasonable. CEO Tom Seibel says C3.ai wants to pursue the brass ring of generative AI. “I believe that it more than doubles the size of our addressable market overnight,” he told analysts. The company will invest in various areas to capture market share quickly. It sees this as a trillion-dollar opportunity.\n\nTo do so, it will build on its “14-year investment in the C3.ai platform.” That harkens back to when the company was first called C3 Energy and targeted utilities. It’s been through several transformations over the years. For a while the company was called C3 IoT as it sought to capitalize on interest in the internet of things. Now AI is the hot trend and the company rebranded once more.\n\nPatience is a Virtue\n\nI continue to urge investors to use caution with C3.ai. Artificial intelligence is going to make millionaires out of investors backing the right horse. There is intense competition as companies jostle for position. Palantir, for example, does a lot of what C3.ai wants to do but does so better and profitably.\n\nOf course, it took Palantir time to become profitable. Last year was its first posting GAAP profits, though it had been profitable on an adjusted basis for some time. C3.ai hasn’t even reached that stage yet.\n\nIt has several strategic partnerships in the tech sector, energy, and with defense contractors. It shows C3.ai has something to offer. Yet in an arena where the market is asking for stocks to put up or shut up, this AI stock may be one to pass on.\n\nIf the opportunity is as great as suggested, there will be plenty of opportunity to buy in at a later date when it overcomes the profitably hurdle.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia's Stock Price Hits Record High, As Analysts Increase Their Outlook On The Company\n\nGlobal markets have turned into a one-trick pony, with all the movements dominated by just a handful of stocks, all within the tech sector in the United States.\n\nThe S&P 500 has now reached a three-year high, according to Jason Goepfert at Sentimenttrader.com, but it is with less than 40 per cent of stocks being above their 10-day moving average, less than 60 per cent above their 50-day average and less than 70 per cent above their 200-day average. That’s only happened once since 1928: Aug. 8, 1929.\n\nThe ratio of the equal-weighted S&P 500 to the cap-weighted S&P 500 has also now fallen to its lowest level since 2009, according to Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp.\n\nAnd since Microsoft Corp. announced its US$10-billion investment in ChatGPT in January 2023, the Magnificent Seven have generated more than 100 per cent of the S&P 500’s price return, with 42 per cent of that return coming from one stock, Nvidia Corp., said macro researcher Andy Constan.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, 2023, Nvidia had added US$750 billion in market cap over 70 consecutive trading days, which is an average of US$10.7 billion per day. That is something considering its market cap five years ago was only US$90 billion and it is now the same size as Amazon.com Inc., making it the world’s fifth-largest company.\n\nBy spending US$5 billion over the past five years, investors have boosted Nvidia by more than US$1.61 trillion in market value, a 19x increase. Somehow, Nvidia is going to backfill trillions by only spending US$10 billion over the next five years, which paints a picture as to how large the expectations are for artificial intelligence and how much market share the company is expected to have.\n\nIt isn’t just Nvidia. Meta Platforms Inc. on Feb. 2, 2024, experienced the largest one-day gain in market capitalization in Wall Street history by adding US$196 billion in market value, bringing its total market capitalization to more than US$1.22 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Amazon last did that in February 2023 when it added $191.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe are breaking new ground here with a level of concentration in so few companies not seen in decades. Daily moves are now so large that they eclipse the size of some of the largest companies in Canada and the world. What is particularly scary is that the average professional trader is between 30 and 39 years old, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, so they likely wouldn’t know this trend is unusual.\n\nOil: that’s a dead commodity, why would anyone touch it? Industrials: if it isn’t AI, it isn’t worth the time. Banking: who needs banks when you have bitcoin? Electric vehicles are more than transportation, they’re data centres or smartphones on wheels.\n\nSome may ask how we got here?\n\nFor 15 years, a lot of U.S. tech companies used either government subsidies or leveraged a near-zero cost of capital to give us products and services at or below cost in order to build out and solidify massive ecosystems that only they control.\n\n“Tech companies conquered the world not with software, but via the usual route to power: ducking regulation, squeezing workers, strangling competitors, consolidating power, raising rents, and riding the wave of an economic shift already well underway,” reads an excerpt from An Alternative History of Silicon Valley Disruption in Wired magazine.\n\nWhile the focus of many people was entirely on things such as climate change and big evil oil, something else quietly took over: Big Tech. This has transformed the markets, the U.S. economy and our lives in many ways that so few realize.\n\nWith the explosive growth of passive investing, these companies ended up dominating the indexes and forcing all of us to buy more of them, thereby compounding their dominance. Most are now transitioning from revenue growth to profitability, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see that result in more layoffs and, eventually, price increases — look at Apple’s latest product launches for example.\n\nIndependent investors should be aware of how everything is connected A new way to use the old retirement laddering strategy Investors’ euphoria over Big Tech ignores a key history lesson\n\nThese companies can now do such things given they have solidified their oligopolies. In addition, they likely no longer need the Fed’s easing or low-rate policies since many shored up their balance sheets, and this is one reason, aside from AI, why their share prices are back at levels prior to when the rate hikes began.\n\nWhere do we go from here? This is a rather difficult question to answer, especially if you haven’t experienced anything like it before. The few of us old-timers who went through the 1990s certainly remember, but we’re hoping for a much different outcome.\n\nMartin Pelletier, CFA, is a senior portfolio manager at Wellington-Altus Private Counsel Inc, operating as TriVest Wealth Counsel, a private client and institutional investment firm specializing in discretionary risk-managed portfolios, investment audit/oversight and advanced tax, estate and wealth planning.\n\nIf you like this story, sign up for the FP Investor Newsletter.",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 12, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n5 Standout Features of Q4 Earnings Season\n\nThe overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum.\n\nEarnings aren’t great, but then again, no one expected corporate profitability to be great. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.\n\nWith quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 9th, here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed.\n\nFirst, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters.\n\nThe absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.\n\nFor the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 80.5% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 65% have beaten revenue estimates.\n\nSecond, companies are making good progress on the margins front.\n\nThe year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance and others.\n\nOn the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Medical, Autos, Energy and Transportation sectors.\n\nThird, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.\n\nFor the 64.5% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +21.5% on +6.4% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates.\n\nLooking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.4% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.\n\nPlease remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector, as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.5% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nWhat this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture, both negative as well as positive. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role.\n\nPlease note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.5% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.\n\nFourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nEach of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.\n\nNvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.\n\nPlease note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.\n\nFive, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.\n\nEstimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Sector Back in Growth Mode\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Arista Networks, Cadence Design, Shopify and Nvidia",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 12, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Arista Networks ANET, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, Shopify SHOP and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Outside the Magnificent 7\n\nToday’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks breaks down where the stock market stands as the S&P 500 hits the 5,000 level for the first time following a largely bullish earnings season thus far. Many of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks have posted strong results. There are also plenty of big tech names outside of this exclusive group for investors to consider buying this earnings season, including the three highly-ranked tech stocks we explore today: Arista Networks, Cadence Design Systems and Shopify.\n\nThe S&P 500 touched 5,000 for the first time on Thursday with quarterly results and guidance already out from six of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks. The market has remained mostly bullish as the overall Q4 earnings picture for the S&P 500 has improved significantly over the last month. Better yet, the outlook for 2024 has remained robust and hardly signals a recession is on the horizon.\n\nThere are still tons of earnings reports to come, including from Nvidia and the three big tech names we dive into today. But Wall Street is now likely more concerned about upcoming guidance from Walmart, Target, and other retailers, as well as January inflation data due out on February 13 since enough large-cap tech names have already provided their all-clear signal.\n\nThat said, stocks and indexes never go straight up and there will almost certainly be a pullback to key shorter-term and longer-term moving averages in the coming weeks since things are looking a bit frothy.\n\nInvestors with long-term outlooks should take advantage of any downturns and dips to scoop up their favorite stocks at slightly better prices, while also not being afraid to buy at near-term highs—because strong stocks keep breaking records over the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista Networks - Q4 Financial Results on Monday, February 12\n\nArista Networks is a networking infrastructure provider and a leader in data-driven, client-to-cloud networking for large data centers, campus and routing environments. ANET has accumulated over 8,000+ cloud customers worldwide, including Microsoft, Meta, and other giants.\n\nANET is projected to grow its sales by 34% in FY23 and 12% next year to climb from $4.4 billion in FY22 to $6.5 billion in FY24. This expected top-line growth follows 23% average revenue expansion over the past five years. Arista’s adjusted EPS are projected to soar 43% in FY23 and 10% higher in FY24. ANET’s upbeat revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now and it has topped our estimates by an average of 12% in the last four quarters.\n\nANET stock has skyrocketed 1,900% during the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 275%. This outperformance includes a 100% surge over the past 12 months and it hit new highs on Thursday. Arista Networks might be a bit overheated right now. But Arista Networks has a sturdy balance sheet and Wall Street is high on the stock.\n\nCadence Design Systems - Q4 Financial Results on Monday, February 12\n\nCadence Design Systems is a titan of the electronic systems design space. The company’s modeling and computational software helps design semiconductors and other vital technologies, helping “turn design concepts into reality.” Cadence boasts Nvidia as a key customer because the GPU and AI chip powerhouse loves its simulation capabilities.\n\nCadence is one of two major players in this key industry that might grow in importance as chips get smaller. Investors can therefore view Cadence as both a chip and an AI investment. Cadence is projected to post 15% revenue growth in FY23 and 11% higher sales in FY24, following 15% averages sales growth in the past three years. CDNS is expected to post 20% adjusted earnings growth in FY23 and 14% higher in FY24, and its positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) heading into its Q4 release.\n\nCandence stock is up nearly 2,000% in the last 10 years vs tech’s 275% and 500% in the last five years. CDNS is up 13% YTD and trading at new records. The stock is far from a value play, but its valuation levels are improving and Wall Street has been paying up for the stock for years.\n\nShopify - Q4 Financial Results on Tuesday, February 13\n\nShopify has been at the cutting edge of e-commerce for nearly two decades, helping companies, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and others with everything from site design and sales to marketing, payments, shipping, and more. Shopify makes money from recurring subscription fees and various add-ons.\n\nShopify’s days of 60% growth are over, but it started to make up for slowing expansion by raising its prices in 2023 for the first time in over a decade. Shopify’s sales climbed 21% in FY22 and its revenue is projected to jump 25% higher in FY23 and another 19% in 2024 to hit $8.32 billion vs. $5.60 billion in FY22.\n\nShopify, like all of the former growth at-all-cost tech firms, is now committed to profits. Its adjusted earnings are projected to climb from $0.04 a share last year to $0.70 in 2023 and then surge another 50% in FY24 to $1.04 a share. Shopify’s upward earnings revisions help it capture that Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nSHOP shares have skyrocketed 230% off their October 2022 lows, including a 75% run during the past year. Despite the comeback, Shopify still trades roughly 50% below its all-time highs and its 2022 stock split has it at around $88 per share. Plus, SHOP’s balance sheet is stellar.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US companies are discussing cost control on earnings calls at a record rate, amid a push to reallocate funds and invest in new technologies, according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley strategists.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPentagon Chief Austin Admitted to Care Unit in Hospital Trump’s NATO Remark Sparks Political Storm in World Capitals Germany’s Days as an Industrial Superpower Are Coming to an End Top Nigerian Banker Killed in California Helicopter Crash\n\nTranscript mentions of “operational efficiency” are at highest ever in the US during this earnings season as companies focus on expense discipline, but also invest in technologies “that can drive future productivity like AI,” a team led by Michael Wilson wrote in a note.\n\nThere is a notable overlap among the industries discussing operational efficiency most prevalently and those that are discussing AI, the strategists said. These groups include software, professional services, health care services, and financial services.\n\nPfizer Inc., BlackRock Inc., and Lam Research Corp. were among S&P 500 companies touting operational efficiency in their earnings calls this season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe rising focus on cost control comes as firms position to protect margins amid hopes for a soft economic landing. Investors have looked for signs of cooling in the jobs market to gauge when the Federal Reserve will lower borrowing costs, although recent hot data has signaled the Fed won’t be easing anytime soon.\n\nManaging expenses has been a key theme this season. Walt Disney Co. said profit this year will rise at least 20% thanks to cost cutting. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. is looking to reduce costs and Levi Strauss & Co. said a new initiative to boost efficiency will include cost-cutting operations like eliminating jobs.\n\nSome companies are reallocating these funds to grow their business. Estée Lauder Cos. is cutting jobs as part of a revamp plan to allow it to respond more quickly to new beauty trends and invest more in its brands. Meta Platforms Inc. is spending aggressively on artificial intelligence advancements while Amazon.com Inc. will be cautious about new investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the artificial intelligence front, all eyes will be on Nvidia Corp. which is expected to report later this month. So far this season, Arm Holdings Plc soared as artificial intelligence spending helped bolster the chip designer’s forecast. Palantir Technologies Inc. also benefited from big demand for its AI technology.\n\nThe bar is high for Nvidia, which has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI trend. Analysts estimate earnings-per-share will rise 602% in its fiscal quarter ending Jan. 31 from a year ago. The Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech stocks including Nvidia need to deliver stellar earnings to keep outperforming the broader market, according to various strategists.\n\nRead more: Nvidia CEO Says Tech Advances Will Keep AI Cost in Check\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Wilson recently listed Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. among a screen of high-quality growth stocks that have overweight ratings from the bank’s analysts.

        "title": "Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks Are Liable to Be Familiar Names",
        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. However, volatility has been heightened for a majority of the decade. Over the previous four years, Wall Street's major stock indexes have bounced between bear and bull markets in successive years.\n\nWhen volatility and uncertainty rule the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to seek out the safety of time-tested and outperforming industry leaders. A perfect example over the past decade has been the \"FAANG stocks.\" But since the midpoint of 2021, companies enacting stock splits have been especially popular. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have been gravitating to stock-split stocks for years\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to change both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse-stock split).\n\nAlthough some companies that have enacted reverse splits have gone on to deliver big-time gains to their shareholders, the bulk of investors' interest in stock-split stocks lies with those conducting forward splits.\n\nFor more than a year, I've been highlighting nine of the most high-profile and widely owned businesses to have completed forward splits since July 2021. In chronological order, this includes:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split in 2021. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split in 2022. DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split in 2022. Shopify(NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split in 2022. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split in 2022. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split in 2022. Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split in 2022. Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split in 2023. Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split in 2023.\n\nStory continues NVDA Chart\n\nAside from the similarity of completing a forward-stock split and handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 over long periods, these nine former stock-split stocks all bring easily identifiable competitive advantages and/or seemingly untouchable moats to the table.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of the share of GPUs in use in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace brings in about 40% of online retail sales in the U.S., while Amazon Web Services is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services provider. DexCom is a top-two player in continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) and has developed numerous generations of CGMs for diabetics. Shopify is the leading provider of e-commerce software platforms in the United States, as of 2023. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share in January, while Google Cloud is the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure services share. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV producer that's generating a recurring profit. Palo Alto Networks is one of the largest next-generation firewall solutions providers in the cybersecurity space. Monster Beverage is the second-leading provider of energy drinks in the U.S., with a 30% share in 2023. Novo Nordisk is a dominant player in the global insulin market, as well as a key innovator of injectable GLP-1 drugs, which have induced weight loss in patients.\n\nMore importantly, among these nine former stock-split stocks are two companies that appear ripe for yet another split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nOut of the nine high-profile stock-split stocks over the past two-and-a-half years, none has a more compelling case to conduct yet another split than semiconductor stock Nvidia. When Nvidia enacted its 4-for-1 split in July 2021, its share price was at roughly $750. Last week, Nvidia's stock hit a fresh (split-adjusted) all-time high of just over $700 per share.\n\nAs noted, artificial intelligence is the driving force behind Nvidia's surging sales and profits. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs have been the clear top choice by businesses looking to incorporate AI solutions and generative AI into their growth strategies.\n\nWhat's been particularly helpful for Nvidia is that demand for AI-fueled GPUs has handily outstripped the supply of these chips. Though Nvidia would probably love to sell more of its A100 and H100 chips, this scarcity has sent the price for existing AI-GPUs into the stratosphere. Whereas Nvidia's cost of revenue has only modestly moved higher, data center sales should have more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (which ended in late January).\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that leading chip-fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is in the process of dramatically increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity. CoWoS is a practical necessity in high-compute data centers given the need to incorporate high-bandwidth memory. Thus, Taiwan Semi's actions should help Nvidia meaningfully ramp production in the current calendar year.\n\nNevertheless, red flags remain with Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence stock -- and not even a potential stock split will whisk them away.\n\nNvidia is beginning to see competition take shape both externally and internally. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year, while Intel unveiled its Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 generative AI software chip in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's top revenue customers, Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are in the process of developing AI chips of their own to lessen their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nTo boot, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble. The fear of missing out (better known as \"FOMO\") has a tendency to lift investor expectations well ahead of tangible demand with next-big-thing trends. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nThe other former stock-split stock that appears ready for round two is none other than cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks. When Palo Alto effected its 3-for-1 forward split in mid-September 2022, its share price was near $550. In the 17 months since conducting its split, shares of the company have more than doubled and are approaching $370.\n\nThe beauty of cybersecurity is that it's become nothing short of a basic necessity for businesses with an online or cloud-based presence. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing, businesses with an online or cloud presence need cybersecurity solutions to protect their data and that of their customers from hackers and robots that don't take a day off.\n\nThe catalyst that's really helped power Palo Alto Networks' gains over the past five years is its purposeful shift away from physical firewall products and toward cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. By the end of fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends July 31), less than 62% of Palo Alto's net sales were traced back to subscriptions and support. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31, 2023), nearly 82% of its sales derived from subscriptions and support.\n\nA cloud-based SaaS operating model is genius for a number of reasons. First, the incorporation of AI and machine learning allows Palo Alto's solutions to be nimbler and more responsive than on-premises security solutions. A subscription-based model also helps with customer retention and can lead to more consistent payouts from clients throughout the year, relative to physical firewall products. And third, a cloud-based SaaS model generates considerably juicier margins than selling physical firewall products.\n\nAdd-on sales are another reason Palo Alto Networks has been virtually unstoppable. The company's high-margin Prisma Cloud platform saw the number of customers purchasing five or more cloud modules grow by a jaw-dropping 166% in the fiscal first quarter, compared to the prior-year period. Palo Alto is landing bigger clients, and it's having success getting many of its larger clients to progressively spend more.\n\nAlthough Palo Alto Networks' stock is historically pricey, average annual earnings growth of at least 20% is a real possibility through the end of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang anticipates advances in computing over the next few years will keep the cost of developing artificial intelligence well below the $7 trillion that Sam Altman is said to be fundraising.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPentagon Chief Austin in Critical Care Unit at Walter Reed Trump’s NATO Remark Sparks Political Storm in World Capitals Germany’s Days as an Industrial Superpower Are Coming to an End Top Nigerian Banker Killed in California Helicopter Crash\n\n“You can’t assume just that you will buy more computers. You have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster and therefore the total amount that you need is not as much,” Huang told the World Government Summit in Dubai on Monday. The 60-year-old’s company makes the most sought-after AI accelerators and he’s confident the chip industry will drive down the cost of AI, as those parts are made “faster and faster and faster.”\n\nHuang was responding to a report in the Wall Street Journal that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is seeking to raise $7 trillion from investors in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, for a semiconductor initiative to power AI projects that would rival Nvidia.\n\nBecause of its uncontested leadership in AI-training chips, Nvidia’s market value has ballooned to more than $1.7 trillion and increased Huang’s personal wealth several times over. Altman and other AI developers are seeking ways to diversify their hardware options, including by exploring chipmaking ventures of their own.\n\nThe world’s leading contract chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., commit in excess of $30 billion in capital expenditures each year to stay ahead of potential rivals. For Altman to have a realistic chance of making a dent in their lead, he would need to spend lavishly on research, development, facilities and expert personnel, but Huang’s view would suggest that better, more cost-efficient chips will make that unnecessary.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the Nvidia CEO doesn’t see an end to the increase in AI spending anytime soon. In his remarks, Huang estimated that the global cost of data centers powering AI will double in the next five years.\n\n“We’re at the beginning of this new era. There’s about a trillion dollars’ worth of installed base of data centers. Over the course of the next four or five years, we’ll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering software around the world,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old Lieutenant It’s Time to Talk About Those Taylor Swift Super Bowl Bets How Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went South Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong Social Media Platforms Are Done With News, But Gen Z Still Treats Them as a Go-To Source\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is a real intelligent way to invest in artificial intelligence\n\nScott Levine (Nvidia): It's hard to imagine that a company with a market capitalization that exceeds $1.7 trillion is still in growth mode, but that seems to be the case with Nvidia. Thanks to the skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence -- and the significant computing requirements of deep learning and analytics -- the company's data center business is booming. And it shows no signs of slowing down as AI continues to pervade more and more areas of our lives.\n\nNvidia achieved record financial results in its fiscal third quarter of 2024, ended Oct. 29, 2023, smashing its guidance of $16 million in revenue and reporting $18.1 billion on the top line. To what does the company attribute this stellar performance? Its data center business. Up 279% year over year, Nvidia's data center business drove the strong quarterly performance, and it's expected to extend into the fourth quarter. Nvidia expects to break another record and report quarterly revenue of $20 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nIt's not solely on the income statement where Nvidia is seeing explosive growth. The cash-flow statement is also prospering thanks to the strong data center business. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, Nvidia reported free cash flow of over $2 billion. In fiscal 2024, however, Nvidia has reported a whopping $15.7 billion in free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is continually innovating to stay at the vanguard of the AI industry. This week, for example, it announced a partnership with Cisco Systems that will even further enhance its data center business. Using Nvidia's Tensor Core GPUs in Cisco's servers, Nvidia believes it will \"enable optimal performance across a broad array of AI and data-intensive workloads in the data center and at the edge.\"\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a backdoor way to play the AI revolution\n\nLee Samaha(Taiwan Semiconductor): The explosion of interest in AI and global 5G rollouts is translating into unprecedented demand for energy-efficient computing power. As such, data centers and communication companies need to invest in high-performance computing (HPC) solutions, and that means chips manufactured by semiconductor foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor. For reference, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple are all clients of Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nAs a foundry, the company neither designs nor markets semiconductors under its name. Instead, it focuses on manufacturing for its customers.\n\nAccording to CEO C.C. Wei on the recent earnings call, \"almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC,\" and management's projection of low- to mid-20% revenue growth (in U.S. dollar terms) for 2024 is built on \"robust AI-related demand.\"\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's management is particularly excited by its 2 nanometer, or N2, technology (a new generation of chips), with Wei noting, \"We are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications.\"\n\nGiven that its N2 technology will be introduced in 2025, and management is forecasting strong revenue growth for 2024 already, it's clear the company has favorable AI-driven tailwinds behind it. It adds up to make Taiwan Semiconductor an excellent play on AI and a cyclical return to growth in the economy.\n\nMicrosoft is a better value than it looks at first glance\n\nDaniel Foelber (Microsoft): Nvidia is top of mind when it comes to investing in leading AI companies. At this rate, it may soon become the third most valuable U.S.-based company. But it's still far away from surpassing Microsoft or Apple.\n\nI think Microsoft can become the first $4 trillion company, and the reason is beautifully simple. Microsoft has direct ways to implement AI solutions across its consumer and (more importantly) enterprise customers. This is a similar market opportunity to Nvidia, which is mainly selling to businesses, not consumers. And I think this is the far more lucrative and easier path toward AI, at least for now, than the consumer market (like the Apple Vision Pro).\n\nAI-powered enterprise solutions have a straightforward purpose -- making the task easier, better, and less time-consuming. Microsoft has real results from its \"everyday AI companion\" Microsoft Copilot. This generative AI solution fits into several Microsoft software products, like its flagship Microsoft 365.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business is another sandbox for AI to thrive. Microsoft reported 53,000 Azure AI customers last quarter, with over one-third joining Azure over the past 12 months.\n\nGitHub, Microsoft's developer program, is another place where AI is having an immediate impact. Microsoft grew GitHub revenue by 40% in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, ended Dec. 30, 2023, compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. The company attributed the growth to GitHub Copilot, which has over 1.3 million paid subscribers, a 30% increase in just one quarter.\n\nThe growth is there for Microsoft. It has many levers it can pull and is showing traction across multiple AI solutions. Microsoft also trades for a 37.3 price-to-earnings ratio, significantly below Nvidia's 92.6 ratio. Neither stock is cheap by any means. But given Microsoft's unique combination of brand power, diversification, cash flow, legacy businesses, and growth potential, the stock is still a good value and has room to run from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Straight From the CEO's Mouth: How 3 Innovators Are Shaping the Future of AI",
        "content": "It's time to explore visionary minds leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, as three pioneering CEOs unveil their strategies for navigating the future of advanced technology.\n\nStraight from the helm of innovation, these leaders share their unique insights and bold predictions, offering a glimpse into how their companies are not just participating in, but actively shaping, the AI landscape. Read on to get the latest, greatest AI insights from the C-suite leaders of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Kulicke & Soffa Industries(NASDAQ: KLIC), and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET).\n\nThis electronics packaging equipment provider remains one of the cheaper ways to play AI growth\n\nBilly Duberstein(Kulicke & Soffa): Investors may think every tech company exposed to powerful artificial intelligence trends has already taken off, but Kulicke & Soffa may be an exception.\n\nFor sure, Kulicke & Soffa's core ball bonding and wedge bonding businesses for high-volume electronics markets are still in the dumps, but they may be reaching a bottom. These legacy core segments make up a majority of the business and are still feeling the downturn in smartphones and PCs, following the boom of the pandemic. In addition, K&S stock fell a bit after recent earnings, as the auto and industrial segment is also now in a downturn, keeping revenue down 3% year over year last quarter, even as other parts of the semiconductor sector begin to recover.\n\nBut in addition to the extreme cyclicality in its core legacy businesses, Kulicke and Soffa is also cultivating new secular high-growth businesses in advanced packaging and mini-LED lighting. These segments are small now but could see strong hypergrowth in the future.\n\nFirst, K&S's thermocompression bonding (TCB) solutions are now used in leading-edge AI chips, especially \"chiplet\" architectures as used in Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) new MI300 chips. While the business is currently much smaller than the core ball bonding business, the company noted in a November press release that its TCB sales had grown at a 149% compound annual growth rate since 2020 and that it expects \"aggressive\" follow-on orders through 2024 and 2025 on strong AI demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn its recent fiscal Q1 conference call, K&S management had more positive things to say about the TCB business, indicating that it's taking market share in this important new product line:\n\nWe continue to actively support several customer engagements in parallel and anticipate additional orders from OSAT, IDM, and Foundry customers as we complete key evaluations and qualifications. In addition to our incumbent position in high-volume semiconductor markets, our advanced packaging efforts allowed us to take share in new high-growth markets including leading-edge logic, mobility and co-packaged optics. We are increasingly confident on the longevity and market potential of our TCB portfolio and expect to extend the technology well beyond the previously targeted 10 micron pitch. Reaching below this 10 micron threshold will further unlock the flexibility and long-term potential of our TCB solutions. We increasingly anticipate TCB will be an essential component to leading-edge assembly for many years to come.\n\nIn addition to new technological breakthroughs and growth in TCB, management also had positive things to say about Project W, a partnership with a very large and high-profile but unnamed customer in advanced display. K&S has recently developed solutions for miniLED and microLED lighting solutions, which offer better resolution than standard screens today, and which are found only in very high-end TV screens and tablets. However, there is the possibility they eventually make it to more mass markets, such as smartphones.\n\nWhile we don't know the identity of the large customer, management noted on the call: \"I am happy to report that we are reaching new milestones, expect to ship additional capacity during the March quarter, and recognize revenue during the upcoming June quarter. As we work to successfully qualify a previously shipped system, we are beginning to ramp production in support of our customer's long-term capacity plan.\"\n\nWhile details will emerge about both Kulicke's TCB growth as well as Project W in the coming months and quarters, K&S remains a pretty cheap stock. It hasn't taken off like other AI names, and based on the average of the $7 it earned at the top of the cycle and the $1 it earned at the bottom last year, KLIC's current $47 stock price makes it a cheap way to play the growth of advanced electronics.\n\nGoogle's new secret weapon: AI subscriptions?\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Alphabet): Google's parent would really like to be known as the AI company. And perhaps for good reason. OpenAI's ChatGPT was once thought to be a disruptor of the internet search titan. Not only has that not transpired, but Google is still thriving as well. It's tough to dislodge a business with computing prowess of such epic proportions.\n\nRather than hamper Google Search, AI tools could actually yield Google new growth outlets. For example, during the last earnings call, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that subscription services just reached $15 billion in annual revenue, a fivefold increase from 2019. YouTube is the marquee subscription product for Alphabet. But Pichai said on the earnings call:\n\nLet me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well, with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we're just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features, and look forward to more strong growth to come.\n\nThat's a lot of subscribers.\n\nGranted, a Google One subscription starts at just $1.99 a month. But on Feb. 8, Google is rolling out a new Google One AI Premium Plan for $19.99 a month, powered by Gemini (formerly Bard). Even if just a few million of those 100 million subs convert to the new premium plan -- say 3 million, which would equate to $60 million in monthly sales -- it could equate to yet another sizable jump in Google's subscription revenue this year. And that's just from one new service.\n\nGoogle has been shelling out billions of dollars in new data center infrastructure to support its new AI aspirations -- $32.3 billion in 2023, to be specific. New subscription services could be one of the ways Google starts to pay for all of that spending. So could Google Cloud business subscribers, which just crossed $9 billion in quarterly revenue at the end of 2023. Gemini is being embedded in Google Cloud, too, and a host of other Google products.\n\nAlphabet stock trades for 25 times trailing-12-month earnings, or 19 times one-year-forward expected earnings. I'm happy to keep holding.\n\nInference at the edge of the cloud: Cloudflare's pivot to AI infrastructure\n\nAnders Bylund (Cloudflare): You might not think of network performance and security expert Cloudflare as an AI company. Truth be told, it really isn't yet. But Cloudflare is setting up the tools and infrastructure to become a major AI name as the industry evolves.\n\nIn Thursday evening's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Matthew Prince noted that Cloudflare isn't collecting \"material\" revenues from AI yet, but that should change over time. For now, the company is covering its global data center network in graphics processing units (GPUs) specialized in inference, which is the end-user phase of accessing advanced AI systems.\n\n\"By the end of 2024, we plan to have inference-tuned GPUs deployed in nearly every city that makes up Cloudflare's global network and within milliseconds of nearly every device connected to the Internet worldwide,\" Prince said. \"I think a lot of the money being spent on AI right now, especially with some of the hyperscale public cloud, is for training of models.\"\n\nThat's not what Cloudflare's worldwide installation of inference GPUs will do. These modest batches of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) can't compete with the monster supercomputers used to train the large language models behind ChatGPT or Google Gemini, but they are available at the drop of a digital hat for lighter workloads. The company is all about network performance and edge computing, not heavy-duty number-crunching. Hence, Cloudflare's GPUs will tap into the AI engines built and trained by big-iron hardware, delivering chatbot conversations and data analysis results to the end user.\n\n\"We are not the right place to actually do model training,\" Prince conceded. \"But as that transitions over time and people start to figure out how can you take the models that you've built and turn them into real products, that's where you'll start to see revenue that is meaningful to us in terms of delivering the value in the AI space. But we're still so early.\"\n\nSo Cloudflare expects to build a robust AI business in the long run. For now, the company is just getting ready for future stages of the AI industry's evolution. Even so, Prince noted that the inference GPUs (also known as Workers AI systems) helped the company land a large number of new or expanded network service deals in the fourth quarter, obliterating Wall Street's consensus estimates across the board.\n\n\"Workers is a big piece of a lot of the deals that we see. So somewhere around 20% of the large deals that we closed have some workers component to it,\" Prince said.\n\nThat's not too shabby for a brand-new product in the early days of a technology revolution. I can't wait to see Cloudflare finding its long-term niche in the AI market. This stock isn't cheap, but it may very well be worth every penny of that premium price in the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Kulicke And Soffa Industries right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Kulicke And Soffa Industries, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Kulicke And Soffa Industries wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Remarkable AI Growth Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before It Soars 59%",
        "content": "\"You only need a few good stocks in your lifetime. I mean how many times do you need a stock to go up tenfold to make a lot of money? Not a lot.\"-Peter Lynch\n\nInvesting is hard; losing stocks are easier to find than winning ones. However, as the great Peter Lynch points out, one or two great stocks can carry many other mediocre ones in an individual portfolio.\n\nToday, I want to examine a stock that has already made many investors rich -- and remains a solid investment today: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is red-hot, thanks to the AI revolution\n\nLet's start with the obvious: Nvidia's stock is on fire. Shares are up 38% year to date, and we're only six weeks into the new year.\n\nThe reason? Artificial intelligence (AI), of course.\n\nAs the designer of the world's premier AI chips, graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia has seen demand for its products skyrocket over the last two years.\n\nIndeed, the demand for AI chips is growing so fast that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that overall energy consumption by data centers may double by 2026.\n\nAnd bear in mind data centers already consume a staggering amount of power. The IEA estimates that in 2022, data centers used roughly 460 terawatt-hours of electricity. That's approximately 1% of global electricity demand, or enough to power 32 million homes for a year.\n\nIn other words, AI infrastructure is already massive, and it's growing even larger. That's great news for Nvidia, whose cutting-edge AI chips are prized by AI developers for their power, speed, and efficiency.\n\nRising revenue, rising stock\n\nNow, let's talk revenue. Nvidia's sales have been climbing steadily as companies like MetaPlatforms have ordered hundreds of thousands of AI chips.\n\nIndeed, Nvidia's revenue over the last 12 months has jumped to $45 billion, up from $26 billion a year ago. However, the company's estimated sales figures are where the eye-popping math appears.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAs you can see, sales estimates for Nvidia's next fiscal year continue to climb. The consensus estimate (yellow line above) is roughly $110 billion, more than double the company's revenue over the last 12 months. What's more, the revenue estimates continue to rise.\n\nAs a result, analysts have been racing to revise their price target for the stock. The highest price target for Nvidia belongs to Rosenblatt Securities' Hans Mosesmann, who, in August 2023, noted the stock could go to $1,100. At the time, that represented 120% upside; today, it's merely 59%.\n\nWhat's an investor to do?\n\nFirst things first: For investors who already own Nvidia, congratulations! There's no better feeling than holding a big winner in your portfolio.\n\nNow, fight the urge to sell. One of The Motley Fool's core investment principles is to let winners run, difficult as it might be to stomach.\n\nGranted, Nvidia's stock could turn lower, perhaps much lower. But the reason for letting winners run is that it allows time to smooth out those big peaks and valleys. Over time, that results in substantial returns for those with the patience to wait it out.\n\nFor those who don't own Nvidia, now may be the time to consider it. Sure, shares have already soared over the last 15 months. But just because a stock is already up big doesn't mean it can't move higher. The AI revolution is in full swing, and the company's sales estimates continue to increase as ever more companies turn to AI to solve problems and deliver efficiencies.\n\nTo close, let's revisit Lynch's advice that one or two good stocks are enough for a lifetime of investing success. For many investors, Nvidia is already one of those names. For others, it may become one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "According to projections from Grand View Research, the artificial intelligence (AI) market will grow at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the sector hit an annual market value of nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade. With growth like that on the horizon, it would be smart to dedicate a portion of your portfolio to companies that can capitalize on this budding industry.\n\nThe launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reinvigorated interest in AI and highlighted just how far the technology had come. AI can bolster countless industries, among them healthcare, consumer tech, productivity software, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nHowever, it'll take time for AI to expand its reach and for companies to fully exploit its potential. While that process continues, here are two exciting AI stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe boom in AI last year cast a bright spotlight on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business as its cutting-edge chips became the preferred hardware for AI developers and cloud infrastructure providers everywhere.\n\nIts years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training AI models, positioned it to immediately begin supplying hardware to countless AI-minded firms as the market exploded. Nvidia got a head start over rivals like AMD and Intel and snapped up an estimated 80% to 95% market share in AI GPUs. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nSoaring chip sales have sent Nvidia's revenues, operating income, and free cash flow skyrocketing over the last year, propelling its stock up over 215%. The company's free cash flow hit more than $17 billion, significantly higher than AMD's just over $1 billion and Intel's negative $14 billion.\n\nSo, despite new GPU releases from both of those rival chipmakers, Nvidia's early advantages in AI have potentially pushed it further ahead, with greater cash reserves to continue investing in its technology and retain its market supremacy.\n\nStory continues NVDA Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nNvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio and price-to-earnings ratio have declined by double-digit percentages in the last six months. And when it comes to these metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\n\nAs a result, now is an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Nvidia that will allow you to benefit from consistently rising demand for its AI GPUs.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nShares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are up 65% since last February, in part due to its significant financial growth and exciting prospects in AI.\n\nThe company posted its fourth-quarter results last week. Revenue rose 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share hit $1.00, compared to the expected $0.80.\n\nOver the last 12 months, impressive growth has sent Amazon's free cash flow soaring by 904% to $32 billion.\n\nThe tech giant's e-commerce business has also returned solidly to growth. However, the best reason to invest in its stock is its highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As the world's leading cloud infrastructure provider, it has the potential to leverage its massive data centers and steer the generative AI market in its favor.\n\nOver the last year, AWS has responded to the rising demand for AI services by expanding its offerings. For instance, in September, the company debuted Bedrock, a tool that offers a range of models that customers can use to build generative AI applications. AWS also introduced CodeWhisperer, a platform that generates code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool capable of transcribing patient-to-physician conversations.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, AWS accounted for 67% of Amazon's operating income despite delivering the lowest revenue of its three segments. As it continues to expand its AI services, Amazon could be in for consistent earnings boosts long into the future. AMZN EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nBased on current estimates, Amazon's earnings could hit just under $7 per share in two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by its forward P/E of 41 yields a stock price of $279. So if projections are correct and the forward ratio stays the same, Amazon's stock will rise 65% by fiscal 2026.\n\nAll of this makes Amazon one of the best AI stocks to buy now and hold for the next decade and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "My 3 Monster AI Growth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in the New Bull Market",
        "content": "The past two years have kept investors on the edge of their seats. In 2022, the three major indexes slipped into bear territory, then rebounded in 2023 as growth stocks soared. But it wasn't until about a month ago that the S&P 500 hit a new all-time high, confirming a bull market has indeed arrived.\n\nThe bull market didn't just start and instead has been in action ever since stocks began recovering from their bear market lows. Bull markets always are declared well after they've begun, but since they generally last for years, there's still plenty of time for investors to benefit. And one of the best ways is to invest in stocks linked to growth as they often thrive in bull environments.\n\nYou can find plenty of great possibilities in one of today's fastest growing markets, artificial intelligence (AI). The global AI market is forecast to grow in the double digits this decade to possibly reach beyond $1 trillion by 2030. Three stocks in particular may come out on top in this technology that could revolutionize everything from business to daily life. Here are my monster AI growth stocks to buy hand over fist in the new bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is making AI top priority at its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cloud business is addressing all three \"layers\" of AI. This includes offering AI chips to companies building their own large language models (LLMs), offering a fully managed selection of existing LLMs to be customized for those that don't want to build their own, and offering applications such as the company's new AI powered assistant.\n\nThe strategy makes AWS the \"go-to\" destination for clients looking to incorporate AI into their businesses. And since AWS already is the global cloud market leader, customers already are there -- AWS just has to serve them the right mix of products and services.\n\nAmazon predicts generative AI will result in tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the company in the coming years. AWS already has been Amazon's main profit driver, so the future definitely looks bright for this business unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Amazon shares trade for 41x forward earnings estimates, down from 56 just a few months ago, representing a solid buying opportunity for this top growth stock.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) originally was a giant in the world of gaming, selling graphics processing units (GPUs) that produced the brilliant images and action gamers love. But in recent years, it became clear that GPUs could serve many other areas thanks to their ability to process multiple tasks at the same time. And that's how GPUs became integral to AI, where high speed is a must.\n\nToday, Nvidia's chips dominate the AI market, with a more than 80% share, and this leadership has helped the company's earnings take off. In the most recent quarter, revenue increased in the triple digits, and net income climbed more than 1,000%.\n\nBut Nvidia's success doesn't look like a one-time deal, and instead, this momentum could continue thanks to the high demand in the AI market -- and considering Nvidia's leadership and investment in research and development.\n\nRight now, Nvidia shares, in spite of soaring 200% over the past year, trade for only 33x forward earnings estimates, an absolute steal for this company powering the AI era.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), like Nvidia, didn't start out as an AI giant in the commercial space. Instead, for years the software as a service company was known for serving governments. Palantir is an expert at aggregating vast collections of data and analyzing this data to draw conclusions that could be crucial to a particular client's operations.\n\nJust last year, Palantir launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which helps its clients use generative AI and their own data to make better decisions and improve processes. The company paired this with AI Bootcamps or sessions to introduce potential clients to the service.\n\nThe efforts have worked. Palantir CEO Alex Karp wrote in the recent shareholder letter that AIP is \"significantly contributing\" to revenue and increasing customer numbers.\n\nImportantly, AI is helping Palantir to make great gains in the commercial market, making it less dependent on government contracts. In the most recent quarter, U.S. commercial revenue surged 70%, and U.S. commercial customer count climbed 55%.\n\nAt 73x forward earnings estimates, Palantir stock may look pricey, but considering the company is in the very early days of its AI story, I expect a lot more earnings growth to come. And that means the stock still represents a great one to buy hand over fist now -- and hold onto for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Has Invested 38% of His Portfolio in These 5 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Is David Tepper an income investor? Nope. The hedge fund manager (and Carolina Panthers owner) probably doesn't factor dividends into his thinking much, if at all, when picking stocks.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean Tepper doesn't own plenty of dividend stocks. There are more of them in the billionaire's Appaloosa Management hedge fund than you might think. He's invested 38% of his portfolio in these five dividend stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) ranks as the top holding in Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund. As of Sept. 30, 2023, it owned 1.95 million shares -- more than 11.5% of the overall portfolio at the time.\n\nUntil recently, Meta wouldn't have made a list featuring Tepper's dividend stocks. However, the social media leader announced on Feb. 1, 2024 that it's initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. This translates to a dividend yield of around 0.44%. It's not great, but it's a start.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trails Meta as Tepper's second-largest position. Appaloosa owned 1.64 million shares of the technology giant at the end of the third quarter of 2023, enough to make up nearly 10.2% of the hedge fund's portfolio.\n\nMany big tech companies don't pay dividends. Microsoft, though, initiated a dividend program way back in 2003.\n\nIts dividend currently yields 0.74%. The company has increased its dividend payout by an impressive 168% over the last 10 years.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the third-largest position for Tepper. That honor belongs to Amazon.\n\nHowever, the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker is the billionaire's No. 4 holding, comprising 8.8% of his total portfolio. Appaloosa owned 1.02 million shares of Nvidia at the end of Q3.\n\nUnlike Amazon, Nvidia pays a dividend. Granted, it's not a huge one: The chipmaker's dividend yield is only 0.02%. Still, the company has increased its payout by 88% since initiating a dividend program in 2015. With a dividend payout ratio of barely over 2%, the company could easily boost its dividend a lot more if it chooses.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is Appaloosa's ninth-largest holding, lagging behind several stocks that don't pay dividends. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the hedge fund owned 6.25 million shares of Intel, representing nearly 4.4% of its portfolio.\n\nOrdinarily, Intel's dividend yield of close to 1.2% wouldn't be anything to get excited about. Compared to most of Tepper's top holdings, though, this yield looks fantastic.\n\nHowever, there's a yellow flag to note: Intel slashed its dividend payout by more than 65% last year as part of a larger cost-cutting effort.\n\n5. Federal Express\n\nNot every dividend stock that Tepper owns is in the tech sector. Federal Express(NYSE: FDX) ranks as his 10th largest position. As of Sept. 30, 2023, Tepper's hedge fund owned 650,000 shares of FedEx, making up 3.4% of its portfolio.\n\nFedEx's dividend yield of over 2.1% is quite respectable. So is the company's payout ratio of under 29%.\n\nArguably, the best thing about FedEx's dividend program is its track record of dividend increases. Over the last 10 years, the shipping and logistics giant has boosted its dividend payout by a whopping 740%.\n\nThe best of the bunch\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying any of these stocks solely for their dividends. However, several of them should deliver strong growth over the next decade and beyond.\n\nIf I had to pick just one as the best of the bunch, I'd go with Meta Platforms. I like Microsoft and Nvidia, too, but Meta has been underrated by Wall Street, in my view. The company's recent blowout quarterly results underscore how much potential it has.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Top Tech Analyst Says It's 1995 Again: 3 AI Stocks to Buy If He's Right",
        "content": "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas for tech investors.\n\nAfter surging 54% last year, the Nasdaq 100 is already up another 4%, paced by the usual suspects. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has jumped 41% so far, maintaining its blistering pace from 2024, and Meta Platforms, another big winner last year, is up 33%.\n\nThe strong start is the latest evidence that investors are living through another iteration of the dot-com boom when the Nasdaq Composite jumped 582% from the start of 1995 to its peak in March 2000.\n\nOne well-regarded tech analyst has called the new tech boom multiple times, touting that \"It's 1995.\" That's Wedbush's Dan Ives. At least since last June, Ives has said we're in another 1995 moment, explaining in a recent post on X: \"In my opinion we are on the doorstep of an internet moment with AI that will transform tech forever. Will change the growth trajectory of the tech sector.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs Ives right about the AI boom?\n\nThe internet is one of the most important transformational innovations in history, and in a generation it has reshaped the way we communicate, entertain ourselves, work, and shop.\n\nIt would be a tall task for any new technology to achieve a similar transformation, but many of the top tech CEOs believe that artificial intelligence (AI) could be equally transformative, if not more so. Oracle co-founder and CTO Larry Ellison, who has been in the industry since the early days of the computer, said: \"Is generative AI the most important new computer technology ever? Probably.\" Tesla CEO and tech visionary Elon Musk has said that AI has the potential to be the most disruptive force in history, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates called AI the most revolutionary technology in decades\n\nIn addition to the forecasts from tech's biggest luminaries, it's also clear that analysts can't keep up with the soaring growth from companies like Nvidia, which has surged past expectations in every quarter since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current predicament in the tech industry offers further evidence that the AI boom is only just starting. Nvidia's revenue and profit have surged in spite of a shortage of its products. There is more demand than the company can fill, and hyperscalers, start-ups, and others need its processors to run the powerful models required for generative AI.\n\nIt will be hard to judge the potential of AI until every company that wants the necessary infrastructure has it, but demand is clearly surging right now.\n\n3 top stocks to buy for a new AI boom\n\nBillionaire investor George Soros famously advised, \"When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy.\"\n\nIt might be too early to call the rally in AI stocks a bubble, but the most obvious plays are often the best ones in these situations, much like stay-at-home stocks such as Zoom Video Communications and Peloton were big winners in the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nBy that same logic, Nvidia still looks like a good choice in the AI revolution. The stock's gains over the past year aren't built on air. Its profit has soared because its technology is in high demand, and its processors are well ahead of the competition. While some expect that gap to close, there are also signs competitive dynamics could move in the opposite direction as Nvidia presses its competitive advantage. For instance, it unveiled new AI PC chips in January, threatening to take market share in a category that Intel has long led.\n\nNvidia also seems well priced, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 33 based on this year's earnings estimates. If the company can exceed that target, the stock will surely move higher.\n\nMicrosoft looks like another easy AI stock to own. While the company doesn't have the same direct exposure to AI demand that Nvidia does, it seems to be the company that's best positioned to benefit from AI in a diverse set of ways. Its partnership with OpenAI has already paid off significantly as its AI-based Copilot is in programs such as Azure, Office 365, Bing, and GitHub. The company said on its recent earnings call that AI was responsible for six additional percentage points of growth, helping it outpace its competition, and it now has 53,000 Azure AI customers.\n\nMicrosoft's early lead also ensures that its highly profitable core product will remain relevant and in demand, helping to block out potential competition.\n\nFinally, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is the third AI stock worth buying for a new tech boom. Like Nvidia, Supermicro has found itself in the envious position of making hardware that helps run AI-based models like those that ChatGPT uses. Supermicro makes server and storage equipment that's in high demand in the AI revolution, driving revenue up 103% in its most recent quarter, and the company is currently supply constrained since it relies on Nvidia chips, meaning that growth could be even stronger.\n\nLike Nvidia, Supermicro is also profitable and trades at a reasonable forward P/E of just 31. Those estimates could easily move higher if supply improves.\n\nIf Ives is right and this is 1995, then there should be plenty of winners in the AI boom. Investors are best off focusing on stocks that are solidly profitable and already clearly benefiting from AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar in 2024",
        "content": "Shares of stock market darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have gained nearly 219% in the past year and have reached near-record highs. The semiconductor giant's prowess in advanced GPUs and artificial intelligence (AI) software has made it the undisputed leader in the AI market, which has translated to dramatic improvement in its financial performance.\n\nAI is undoubtedly the biggest investment theme in 2024. Many investors may be feeling that they have missed the Nvidia rally, especially since the company is now trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33 times -- far higher than the median semiconductor industry valuation of 19.4 times. These investors can consider buying stakes in other high-quality AI stocks with relatively reasonable valuations, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nHere's why these two stocks are attractive picks in 2024.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTechnology titan Microsoft has come out with stellar results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, with both revenue and earnings surpassing consensus estimates. Not surprisingly, AI has been a major driving force for the company.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud computing platform is the key growth engine, with revenue soaring 30% year over year (including a six percentage point lift from AI services) in the second quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023. On the contrary, revenue from key competitors such as Amazon's AWS and Alphabet's Google Cloud grew year over year by 13% and 26%, respectively, in the most recent quarters. Azure has also managed to secure larger and longer-term deals, including billion-dollar-plus commitments. This will ensure that the business can remain relatively unscathed even in difficult times.\n\nAzure is also quickly becoming an ideal cloud computing platform for AI workloads, thanks to its top-notch performance in training and inferencing of large language models. Microsoft offers customers a diverse selection of AI software models and AI hardware (from multiple chip players) to choose from, all integrated deeply with Azure infrastructure, data, and tools. The company has already built a base of 53,000 Azure AI customers, of which nearly one-third have joined the Azure platform in the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother major growth catalyst for Microsoft is the AI-powered assistant CoPilot embedded in multiple Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365 productivity suite, GitHub, and Microsoft security platform. The company expects the rapid adoption and monetization of CoPilot to translate into a significant improvement in average revenue per user in the coming years.\n\nBesides the multiple AI tailwinds, Microsoft's core PC and gaming businesses are also set to recover in 2024. The company's productivity and business processes division has also returned to double-digit growth in the past few quarters.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.3 times, which is quite expensive compared to the software industry's median valuation of 2.2 times. However, considering the company's strength in the AI market and improving IT spending trends, this leading consumer and enterprise software company can prove to be a smart buy in 2024 -- even at the current elevated price levels.\n\nIntel\n\nSemiconductor giant Intel has seen its shares tank by nearly 13.4% after posting mixed fourth-quarter 2023 results on Jan. 25. While the company's revenue and earnings surpassed consensus estimates, its earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 fell significantly short of analysts' expectations. Intel has attributed the weak outlook to temporary headwinds in the Mobileye autonomous driving business, PSG (Programmable Solutions Group), and Intel Foundry Services businesses. Despite these setbacks, there are few positives for this stock.\n\nThe PC market seems to be recovering in 2024. IDC expects the total PC market to grow 3.4% year over year in 2024 -- driven by the PC refresh cycle to replace the aging installed base of commercial PCs and upgrade to new PCs with integrated AI capabilities. With its market-leading position in the client PC market, Intel is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\n\nIntel is also making rapid strides in the AI PC market with its Core Ultra client processors -- also known as Meteor Lake. These processors have been designed to run low-power computations for AI workloads on client PCs. The company has partnered with more than 100 independent software vendors and plans to release over 300 AI-accelerated software features optimized for its AI PCs through 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the company's partnerships with multiple PC manufacturers will also play a pivotal role in driving the adoption of its AI PC systems. Intel expects to ship 40 million AI PC systemsin 2024, to be used in over 230 designs from ultrathin PCs to hand-held gaming devices. Even without a significant impact from AI PC systems, Intel's client computing business saw a healthy 33% year-over-year jump in revenue to $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nIntel also sees its foundry business as a major growth catalyst and expects to become the second-largest foundry by 2030. Although the business currently focuses on traditional chip packaging, Intel expects its wafer manufacturing and advanced chip packaging to earn meaningful revenue in the coming years. This will be driven by the increasing rapid global adoption of AI technologies, which needs a secure and sustainable supply chain of AI-optimized chips. Intel's foundry business has already secured commitments from multiple clients and has a disclosed total deal value pipeline of over $10 billion. In the fourth quarter, foundry services posted a solid 63% year-over-year jump in revenue to $291 million.\n\nIntel is currently trading at a P/S ratio of 3.5 times, far lower than that of peers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Hence, considering the strong tailwinds and reasonable valuation, Intel may be a smart AI long-term buy -- even if the stock encounters some choppiness in the short run.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Stock market corrections can present many long-term buying opportunities. Corporations in rapidly growing segments like artificial intelligence (AI) usually get hit the hardest by these market shifts.\n\nAny dips can intimidate new investors, but experienced investors use these opportunities to load up on their favorite stocks. Lower prices can offer more potential and improve an investor’s margin of safety.\n\nIf any of these AI stocks to buy dip, you may want to give them a closer look.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Illustration with icons of a business development company\n\nSource: GIGISTOCK / Shutterstock\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been a leader in the AI industry and has rewarded long-term investors. Shares are up by more than 700% over the past year and have 5-year gains that exceed 4,459%.\n\nShares initially soared by over 10% after the company released an excellent earnings report. However, the equity couldn’t hold onto most of its gains. The firm proved it is growing at a rapid pace that resembles Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) success in 2023.\n\nAny short-term weaknesses present long-term buying opportunities for a company at the center of a high-growth industry. Supermicro offers servers that can handle the intense workload of AI tools.\n\nThe company has achieved exceptional top-line and bottom-line growth that makes the valuation attractive. The stock currently trades at a 35-forward P/E ratio and has a net cash position of $350.03 million.\n\nSupermicro has generated attractive returns and doesn’t look like it’s done just yet. The company should report exceptional growth rates over the next few quarters as AI gains more momentum and the firm has lower benchmarks to surpass.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and software giant that posts high profit margins while growing the top and bottom lines. Shares have marched 108% higher over the past year and are up 364% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock, with 19 out of 20 rating it as a Buy. The other two analysts rated the stock as a Hold. The highest price target is $1,550, implying a 21.6% potential upside.\n\nBroadcom’s well-publicized acquisition of VMware will give the company a better position for its software segment. While semiconductor chips — AI chips in particular — are the main focus, the company’s software business is also looking good.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan offered several remarks in the press release detailing the acquisition.\n\n“Together we are well positioned to enable global enterprises to embrace private and hybrid cloud environments, making them more secure and resilient. Broadcom has a long track record of investing in the businesses we acquire to drive sustainable growth, and that will continue with VMware for the benefit of the stakeholders we serve.”\n\nBroadcom has delivered impressive results to shareholders for many years. Investors have reasons to feel confident that Broadcom will find more potential within VMware and reward long-term investors.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

The company recently crossed the $1 trillion milestone, and it looks like it can exceed a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2024. The stock currently has a $1.8 trillion market cap and a 34-forward P/E ratio.\n\nThe company’s GPU chips have generated more traction because of AI, but they have a deeper history. Nvidia claims to have invented GPU chips in 1999. Although other chipmakers produced similar chips, Nvidia popularized the term “GPU.”\n\nThese chips helped Nvidia establish a large presence in the gaming industry. Nvidia’s GPUs helped spur growth in the computer gaming market when they were introduced. More than two decades later, the company closed out Q3 FY24, generating $2.86 billion in revenue from its gaming segment. That figure represents an 81% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nAI growth is the main driver of Nvidia’s earnings. However, the company isn’t AI or bust. Investors will get exposure to several high-growth business segments under the Nvidia umbrella.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI, AVGO, and NVDA.

        "title": "Did Qualcomm Just Pull a Fast One on Nvidia and Intel's Mobileye?",
        "content": "Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) recent financials offer further proof that the smartphone and other consumer electronics markets are finally making a comeback after getting through a tough 2022 marred by excess inventory. That comeback comes just as the industrial chip market (which includes chips for electric vehicles (EVs)) is now entering a similar period of decline. After several years of chip shortages, there are now too many industrial chips in inventory in the global supply chain.\n\nThankfully, Qualcomm's small automotive segment is bucking the trend, completely passing up the pedestrian-looking results from leading automotive chip designers Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) (which is still majority-owned by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)).\n\nIs it time to get excited about Qualcomm's auto chip business?\n\nQualcomm's victory lap?\n\nFor starters, let's first acknowledge that some 80% of Qualcomm's revenue still comes from the smartphone market. Thus, the company will still be highly reliant on a stabilization in smartphone sales in 2024. So far, so stable. Based on overall guidance for the first few months of the calendar year, Qualcomm is expecting as much as a 5% rise in sales this year. Clearly, there's still more work to be done to get the consumer electronics market (which also includes the rallying PC and laptop space) back in tip-top shape.\n\nBut then there's Qualcomm's automotive segment, which blew away expectations with a 31% year-over-year revenue increase to $531 million in the last quarter (Q1 fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 24, 2023).\n\nIt's an impressive showing for Qualcomm, especially considering its peers in advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and other auto tech suppliers have been reporting.\n\nCompany Q3 2023* Change (YOY)  Q4 2023* Change (YOY)  Q1 2024 Outlook* Implied Change (YOY)  Qualcomm** $535 million 15% $598 million 31% Down slightly from Q4 20%-plus Mobileye** $530 million 18% $637 million 13% $229 million (Approx. 50%) Nvidia** $261 million 4% n/a n/a n/a n/a\n\nData sources: Qualcomm, Mobileye, and Nvidia. *Data is for the calendar year quarter. **Nvidia's latest quarter ended Oct. 29, 2023, Qualcomm ended Dec. 24, 2023, and Mobileye's latest quarter ended Dec. 30, 2023. Nvidia's calendar Q4 and Q1 have not yet been reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm is a different breed of automotive chip designer\n\nWhat is Qualcomm doing differently that's helping it out-drive its competitors? There's one key factor: Qualcomm isn't just an ADAS and self-driving car chip company. Qualcomm's automotive segment also includes digital cockpit and infotainment chips, vehicle mobile connectivity, and other solutions that an automaker can pick and choose from depending on their model and trim level.\n\nConversely, Mobileye is focused on just ADAS and self-driving car applications. Nvidia's automotive segment is similarly aligned, while its data center solutions for automakers like software and self-driving AI algorithm development are reported under its booming \"Data Center\" segment.\n\nQualcomm's auto revenue currently sits at just 6% of total revenue, but that figure is quickly rising. Back in late 2022, Qualcomm outlined plans to get auto chips up to at least $4 billion by fiscal year 2026 (mostly calendar year 2025), a nearly 70% increase from the annualized auto revenue run-rate just reported last quarter. That's impressive considering the slump the auto industry is now entering, and another reason why I'm bullish on Qualcomm in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qualcomm right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualcomm, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Qualcomm wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Phenomenal Companies That Will Be Massive Winners, Regardless of Who Wins the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Arms Race",
        "content": "Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) can be overwhelming, as many companies benefit from this trend. Whether it's a company deploying AI to improve its business or one that makes AI software, there are a lot of opportunities.\n\nHowever, there are also hardware components of AI, and many of these companies will be winners regardless of what happens to individual companies. I've pinpointed four that will be massive winners over the coming years.\n\n1. ASML\n\nA microchip is at the core of every computer used to create an AI model. These components require highly specialized machinery to make them, and one of the key suppliers in this realm is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). The company makes lithography machines, which make the conductive traces on chips.\n\nSemiconductors have reached the point where the distance between these traces is as small as 3 nanometers (nm). For reference, the human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide. With smaller distances between traces, these chips become more powerful and efficient -- a key need for any device.\n\nASML currently holds a technological monopoly in this space, as no other companies make EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines. If you're making cutting-edge chips, you must work with ASML. As a result, ASML will be a huge winner in this space.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a huge user of these machines. The company is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, which means it makes chips for other clients.\n\nTSMC is a leader in this field, as it has 3-nm chips but is also developing 2-nm chips slated to launch in 2025. Taiwan Semiconductor's innovative culture is always working on the next thing, which will provide continual revenue boosts as these new products launch.\n\nAmong Taiwan Semiconductor's customers are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD, which provide another critical component in the AI value chain.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia has probably received the most attention in this group, as its best-in-class GPUs (graphics processing units) are crucial in AI. GPUs are used to process vast amounts of data and train AI models, making them must-have hardware.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a business outfits a computer to train these models, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy thousands. This caused Nvidia's revenue to explode higher in 2023, as the demand for its GPUs was unprecedented. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNvidia's strength will continue as long as AI is a massive trend, as it requires a significant computing infrastructure buildout.\n\n4. Super Micro Computer\n\nYou can't just go out and buy a few thousand Nvidia GPUs filled with Taiwan Semiconductor chips made with ASML's lithography machines, hook them up, and expect a positive result. Instead, a specialized server is needed to maximize efficiency so a business can get the most performance out of its supercomputer.\n\nThat's where Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) comes in. Supermicro specializes in server design, whether it's being used for engineering simulations, drug discovery, or AI model training. Its products are highly configurable, whether a company wants a couple of hundred GPUs or a couple of thousand.\n\nAs the demand for AI computers reaches the general market, Supermicro will continue to excel, which is part of the reason the stock is up around 140% to start in 2024.\n\nA basket of AI winners\n\nYou don't have to pick a single winner to be a successful AI investor. Instead, you could select a variety of stocks that are critical suppliers in the AI field and likely do quite well.\n\nThis group will be successful regardless of which company produces the best AI product, as they provide the building blocks necessary for all AI models.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "There's no getting around the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) has had on the market trajectory over the past year or so. Some would even argue that the latest advances in AI helped spark the rally in 2023, lifting Wall Street from its bear market doldrums.\n\nGenerative AI promises to unleash a wave of increased productivity, and stock market pundits are still debating how much it will ultimately be worth. Most estimates start at the $1 trillion range and go up from there.\n\nAn opportunity of this magnitude has businesses and investors alike scrambling to get their piece of the pie. Unfortunately, the mad dash has others decrying the trend as a bubble or hype.\n\nNot so, says Arm Holdings CEO Rene Haas. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the chief executive said: \"AI is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle. We believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we're only at the beginning.\"\n\nThat's a bold proclamation, but one that's being echoed around the halls of the world's biggest tech companies. If Haas is right -- and I believe he is -- there's one AI stock I will continue buying hand over fist: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJack be nimble...\n\nIt's worth taking a moment to step back and look at how Nvidia got to be one of the dominant forces in technology today. The company pioneered the modern graphics processing unit (GPU), rendering lifelike images in video games.\n\nThe technology that made that all possible is parallel processing, which can tackle complex mathematical processing jobs by breaking them down into manageable bits and running them simultaneously. Nvidia quickly realized that this technology had far broader applications, pivoting to apply it to earlier versions of AI, cloud computing, data centers, self-driving technology, and more.\n\nThe company gained an early lead in machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- and boasts roughly 95% of that market, according to New Street Research. So when generative AI came calling, Nvidia was ready.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of the current demand for AI comes from cloud infrastructure providers, which make generative AI available to their customers. A look at Nvidia's cloud computing customer list reads like a who's who of technology: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud all employ Nvidia processors in their cloud operations, as do Oracle Cloud, Baidu AI Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud.\n\nNvidia is the gold standard for speeding data through the ether, controlling an estimated 95% of the GPUs used in the data center market, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino. Yet the opportunity is largely untapped. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann posits that AI has ignited an upgrade cycle in the data center industry in order to handle the computational demands of generative AI. With an installed base worth roughly $1 trillion, the runway ahead is long.\n\nJack be quick...\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia innovates makes it difficult for its rivals to gain ground. As soon as a competitor comes out with a processor that's even close to Nvidia's capabilities, the company is ready to introduce the next generation of its lightning-fast chips. The reason? Nvidia boasts an ever-growing research and development (R&D) budget that could run a small country.\n\nFor example, in Nvidia's fiscal 2023 (ended Jan. 29, 2023), the company spent 27% of its total revenue -- $7.34 billion in all -- on R&D, creating the next generation of its cutting-edge technology. Nvidia has already spent $6.2 billion through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, and that number will no doubt be higher when Nvidia issues its full-year report later this month.\n\nThis heavy spending has kept the GPU pioneer ahead of the AI curve, which is clear in its recent results. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29), Nvidia generated record revenue of $18.1 billion, up 206% year over year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.71, which soared 1,274%. Despite easy comps from last year's market slump, the results were nonetheless remarkable.\n\nSome investors cite Nvidia's lofty valuation as a reason to avoid the stock -- an understandable but myopic view, in my opinion. The stock is selling for 92 times earnings and 39 times sales, which seems outrageous at first glance but fails to take into account the company's triple-digit growth, which management expects will continue. However, using the more appropriate price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio reveals a valuation of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock.\n\nGiven the company's industry-leading position, track record of growth, and surprisingly modest valuation, Nvidia is the one stock I plan to continue buying if AI is, indeed, \"the most profound opportunity of our lifetimes.\"\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Those are the big drivers.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.64 points, or 0.14%, to 38,671.69, the S&P 500 gained 28.70 points, or 0.57 %, to 5,026.61 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 196.95 points, or 1.25 %, to 15,990.66.\n\nPositive earnings and the boost from AI optimism has helped the S&P 500 to notch 10 intraday record highs so far this year.\n\nThe Nasdaq closed just 0.4% below its 16,057.44 record closing high registered in November 2021.\n\nFor the week, all three indexes registered their fifth straight weekly gain with the S&P adding 1.4%, the Nasdaq rising 2.3% and the Dow climbing 0.04%.\n\nEarlier, data showed U.S. monthly consumer prices rose less than initially estimated in December, but underlying inflation remained a tad warm - a mixed picture that clouded expectations on the timing of interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nStrong economic data and hawkish comments from Fed policymakers in recent days have dashed hopes the central bank would start cutting interest rates in March.\n\nBut Ghriskey points to Fed official predictions in the \"dot-plot,\" which still imply a rate cut this year.\n\n\"The market does have the Fed's wind at its back. Seemingly we've reached the top of interest rates. The next move is going to down. We don't know when that's going to be. The Fed keeps throwing cold water on that idea but their votes with the dots say they're going to be easing in the second half.\"\n\nMarket participants are awaiting data on January consumer prices next week for more clues on when the Fed will cut borrowing costs.\n\nIn individual stocks, Cloudflare rallied 19.5% as it forecast upbeat first-quarter revenue and profit. But PepsiCo fell 3.6% after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates as multiple price increases crimped demand for its juices and Lay's crisps.\n\nPinterest shares sank 9.5% after it forecast first-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE with 456 new highs and 64 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq 2,960 issues advanced and 1,300 declined with advancing issues outnumbering decliners by a 2.3-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 312 new highs and 91 new lows.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 11.53 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.69 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York, Sruthi Shankar and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai, Shounak Dasgupta and Aurora Ellis)",
